THE CURSE OF 
CAMP COLD LAKE 

Goosebumps - 56 
R.L. Stine 



1 


I got off to a bad start at Camp Cold Lake. 

I was nervous when I arrived. And I guess I did some dumb things. 

Well, I didn’t want to go to a water sports camp. 

I don’t like to be outdoors. I hate the feeling of grass brushing against my 
ankles. I don’t even like to touch trees. And I certainly don’t like getting wet. 

Sure, I like to go swimming once in a while. But not every day! What’s the 
point of that? 

I like to swim in a nice, clean pool. I took one look at the lake here—and I 
was sick. I knew there had to be horrible things swimming around in that water. 

Ugly creatures, waiting below the surface. Thinking to themselves: “Sarah 
Maas, we’re waiting for you. Sarah, we’re going to rub our slimy bodies on your 
legs when you swim. And we’re going to chew off your toes, one by one.” 

Yuck. Why do I have to swim in slime ? 

Of course, Aaron was so excited, he nearly exploded. 

When we climbed off the camp bus, he was jumping up and down and 
talking a mile a minute. He was so crazed. I thought he was going to burst out of 
his clothes and go running into the lake! 

My brother likes camp. He likes sports and the outdoors. He likes just about 
everything and everyone. 

And everyone always likes Aaron. He’s so enthusiastic. He’s so much fun. 

Hey—I like to have fun too. But how can you have fun when there are no 
malls, no movie theaters, no restaurants to get a slice of pizza or a bag of french 
fries? 

How can you have fun up to your neck in a freezing cold lake every day? In 
a camp miles from any town? Surrounded on all sides by thick woods? 

“This is going to be awesome!” Aaron declared. Dragging his duffel bag, he 
hurried off to find his cabin. 

“Yeah. Awesome,” I muttered glumly. The bright sun was already making 
me sweat. 

Do I like to sweat? Of course not. 

So why did I come to Camp Cold Lake? I can answer that in three words: 
Mom and Dad. 



They said that a water sports camp would give me confidence. They said it 
would help make me more comfortable with the outdoors. 

And they said it would give me a chance to make new friends. 

Okay, I admit it. I don’t make friends easily. I’m not like Aaron. I can’t just 
walk up to someone and start talking and kidding around. 

I’m a little shy. Maybe it’s because I’m so much taller than everyone else. 
I’m a whole head taller than Aaron. And he’s only a year younger than I am. 
He’s eleven. 

I’m tall and very skinny. Sometimes Dad calls me “Grasshopper”. 

Guess how much I like that. 

About as much as I like swimming in a cold lake filled with hidden 
creatures. 

“Be a good sport about it, Sarah,” Mom said. 

I rolled my eyes. 

“Give camp a chance,” Dad added. “You might surprise yourself and have a 
good time.” 

I rolled my eyes again. 

“When you come home at the end of summer, you’ll probably beg us to 
take you camping!” Dad joked. 

I wanted to roll my eyes again—but they were getting tired from all that 
rolling. 

I gave my parents a glum sigh. Quick hugs. Then I followed Aaron onto the 
camp bus. 

He grinned the whole way to camp. He was really excited about learning 
how to water-ski. And he kept asking everyone if the camp had a high diving 
board over the lake. 

Aaron made three or four good friends on the bus ride to camp. 

I stared out the window, watching the endless blur of trees and farms. 
Thinking about my lucky friends who got to stay home and hang out at the mall. 

Then here we were at Camp Cold Lake. Kids pulling their bags off the bus. 
Laughing and joking. Counselors in dark green T-shirts greeting everyone, 
pointing them in the right direction. 

I began to cheer up a little bit. 

Maybe I will make some new friends, I thought. Maybe I’ll meet some kids 
who are a lot like me—and we’ll have a great summer. 

But then I stepped into my cabin. I saw my three bunk mates. I looked 



around. 

And I let out a cry. “Oh, no! No way!” 



2 


I guess I shouldn’t have freaked like that. 

It made a very bad first impression. 

But what was I supposed to do? 

There were two bunk beds in the cabin. The three other girls had already 
chosen their beds. There was only one bed left—right in front of the window. 

And the window had no screens. 

Which meant that my bed would be crawling with bugs. I took one glance 
—and I knew I’d be swatting mosquitoes every night for the whole summer. 

Besides, I can’t sleep in a top bunk. I toss and turn a lot at night. If I slept 
on top, I’d fall on my head. 

I had to sleep on the bottom. In the bed against the far wall, away from the 
open window. 

“I—I can’t do this!” I blurted out. 

My three bunk mates turned to look at me. One had blond hair pulled back 
in a ponytail. Near her was a short, chubby girl with long brown hair. In the 
bottom bunk against the wall, an African-American girl with long cornrows 
stared across the cabin at me. 

I guess they wanted to say hi and introduce themselves. But I didn’t give 
them a chance. 

“Someone has to trade beds with me!” I cried. I didn’t mean to sound so 
shrill. But I was really upset. 

Before they could answer, the cabin door swung open. A sandy-haired 
young guy in a dark green camp T-shirt poked his head in. 

“I’m Richard,” he said. “I’m the boss guy, the head dude. Everything okay 
in here?” 

“No!” I cried. 

I couldn’t stop myself. I was just so nervous and unhappy. “I can’t sleep in 
this bunk!” I told him. “I don’t want to be near the window. And I need to sleep 
on the bottom.” 

I could see that the other girls were shocked by my outburst. 

Richard turned to the girl who was sitting on the bottom bunk against the 
wall. “Briana, would you trade beds with—” 



“Sarah,” I told him. 

“Would you trade bunks with Sarah?” Richard asked Briana. 

She shook her head so hard, the beads in her cornrows rattled against each 
other. “I really don’t want to,” she said softly. 

She pointed to the chubby girl with long brown hair, who sat on a camp 
trunk. “Meg and I were bunk mates last year,” Briana told Richard. “And we 
kind of wanted to be together.” 

Meg nodded. She had a round, baby face. Squirrel cheeks out to here. And 
she wore blue and red braces on her teeth. 

“I can’t sleep in front of the window,” I insisted. “I really can’t. I hate 
bugs.” 

Richard stared hard at Briana. “How about it?” 

Briana groaned. “Oh... all right.” She made a face at me. 

“Thanks,” Richard said. I could see he was studying me. 

He probably thinks I’m a real troublemaker, I thought. 

Briana climbed off the bottom bunk. She dragged her duffel bag across the 
room to the bunk by the window. “It’s all yours,” she muttered. 

She didn’t say it in a friendly way. 

I felt bad. My bunk mates hate me already, I thought. 

Why do I always do that? Why do I always get nervous and start off on the 
wrong foot with people? 

Now I’ve got to try really hard to make them my friends, I decided. 

But a minute later, I did something horrible.

“Hey—thanks for trading bunks, Briana,” I said. “That was really nice of you.” 

She nodded but didn’t say anything. Meg pulled open her trunk and started 
shoving shorts and T-shirts into her dresser drawer. 

The third girl smiled at me. “Hi. I’m Janice,” she said. She had a raspy, 
hoarse voice. “Everyone calls me Jan.” 

Jan had a nice smile. She had her blond hair pulled back in a ponytail. She 
had dark blue eyes and red cheeks. She seemed to be blushing all the time. 

“Were you here last summer?” I asked her. 

She shook her head. “No. Briana and Meg were here. But this is my first 
summer. I went to tennis camp last year.” 

“I’ve never been to any kind of camp,” I confessed. “I—I guess I’m a little 
nervous.” 

“Are you a good swimmer?” Briana asked. 

I shrugged. “Pretty good, I guess. I don’t swim much. I don’t really like it.” 

Meg turned from her trunk. “You don’t like to swim, and you came to a 
water sports camp?” 

Briana and Jan laughed. 

I could feel my face grow hot. I didn’t want to tell them that my parents 
made me come to this camp. That just sounded too geeky. I didn’t know what to 
say. 

“I... uh... I like other things,” I stammered. 

“Oh—I love that swimsuit!” Briana declared. She pulled a bright yellow 
swimsuit from Meg’s trunk and held it up in front of her. “This is excellent!” 

Meg tugged it back. “Like it would really fit you!” she muttered, rolling her 
eyes. Her braces clicked when she talked. 

Meg looked a little like a bowling ball next to tall, graceful Briana. 

“Did you lose weight over the winter?” Briana asked her. “You look great. 
Really, Meg.” 

“I lost a little,” Meg replied. She sighed. “But I didn’t get any taller.” 

“I grew about a foot this year,” I chimed in. “I’m the tallest girl in my 
school. Everyone stares at me when I walk through the halls.” 

“Boo hoo,” Meg said sarcastically. “You’ve really got it tough. Would you 



rather be a shrimp like me?” 

“Well... not really,” I replied. 

Ooops. I realized I’d said the wrong thing. 

I saw a flash of hurt in Meg’s eyes. 

Why did I say that? I asked myself. 

Why do I keep putting my foot in my mouth? 

I picked up my backpack from where I had tossed it on the floor. I carried it 
to my bunk to unpack it. 

“Hey—that’s mine! Put it down!” Jan came rushing over to me. 

I glanced down at the backpack. “No. It’s mine,” I insisted. 

I started to unzip it—and it fell off the bed. 

A whole bunch of things fell out and clattered across the cabin floor. 

“Oh!” I cried out in surprise. The stuff wasn’t mine. 

I saw pill bottles. Medicine jars. And little plastic inhalers. 

“Asthma medicine?” I cried. 

Jan dropped to her knees and began gathering it all up. She glared up at me 
angrily. “Thanks a bunch, Sarah,” she growled. “Thanks for letting the whole 
world know I have asthma. Why don’t you stand up at the campfire tonight and 
announce it to the whole camp?” 

“Sorry,” I murmured weakly. 

“I told you it was my backpack,” Jan snapped. 

Meg bent down and picked up an inhaler for Jan. 

“Having asthma is nothing to be ashamed of,” she told Jan. 

“Maybe I like to keep some things to myself,” Jan snapped. She shoved all 
the medicine into the pocket and grabbed the backpack away. 

“Sorry,” I said again. “Really.” 

All three girls glared at me. Briana shook her head. Meg tsk-tsked. 

They hate me already, I thought. 

I felt sick. Really sick. 

They hate me, and it’s only the first day. The first hour. 

With a sigh, I slumped down on my bunk. 

Can things get any worse? I wondered. 

Guess the answer to that.

Later that night, we had our first campfire. It was built in a wide, flat clearing 
near the woods. Smooth logs were placed in a circle to be used as benches. 

I dropped down on an empty log with my back to the trees. Flames from the 
big fire danced brightly against the gray evening sky. 

The fire crackled and popped. It smelled so sweet. I took a deep breath. 

Counselors tossed more sticks on the fire. Soon the flames rose up over 
their heads. 

The night air was hot and dry. My cheeks burned from the heat tossed off 
by the fire. 

I turned away and gazed into the woods. The dark trees shivered in a light 
breeze. In the gray light, I saw a squirrel dart between tall weeds. 

I wondered what other animals lurked in the woods. I imagined there were 
bigger animals than squirrels in there. Bigger and more dangerous. 

A loud POP from the fire made me jump. 

It’s creepy outside at night, I thought. Why can’t they have the campfire 
indoors? In a fireplace or something. 

I slapped a mosquito on my neck. 

When I turned back to the fire, I saw Briana and Meg on another log bench. 
They were laughing about something. Talking to two girls I didn’t know. 

I saw Aaron on the other side of the flames. He was goofing with two other 
guys. They were wrestling around, trying to shove each other off the log. 

I sighed. Aaron has already made a bunch of friends, I thought. 

Everyone has made friends—but me. 

Aaron saw me staring at him. He waved quickly, then turned back to his 
friends. 

On the next log, three girls had their heads tossed back. They were loudly 
singing the camp song. 

I listened carefully, trying to learn the words. But they had a giggling fit 
halfway through and didn’t finish the song. 

Two older girls sat down on the other end of my log. They looked about 
fifteen or sixteen. I turned to say hi to them. But they were busy talking. 

One of them had a bag of Gummi Worms in her hand. She kept pulling 



them out of the bag one by one and slurping them slowly like spaghetti noodles. 

Richard, the head counselor, stepped in front of the fire. He had a black 
baseball cap turned backwards on his head. His baggy shorts were torn and dirty 
from working on the fire. 

He raised both hands over his head. “Are we all here?” he called out. 

I could barely hear him. Everyone was still talking and laughing. Across the 
fire, I saw Aaron standing up, wiggling his whole body in a funny dance. 

His friends were laughing their heads off. One of them slapped Aaron a 
high five. 

“Can we get started?” Richard called out. “Can we start our welcoming 
campfire?” 

A log cracked in the fire. Red embers shot up all around. 

“Oh!” I let out a cry as a hand grabbed my shoulder. 

“Who—?” I spun around, startled. And stared up at Briana and Meg. 

They leaned over me. In the darting firelight, I saw their frightened 
expressions. 

“Sarah—run!” Briana whispered. 

“Get up—quick!” Meg tugged my arm. “Run!” 

“Why? What’s wrong?” I sputtered. 



5 


I jumped shakily to my feet. “What’s wrong?” 

“Those boys,” Meg whispered. She pointed across the fire. “They threw 
fireworks in the fire! It’s going to explode!” 

“Run!” both girls cried. 

Meg gave me a shove to get me started. 

I stumbled—and then lurched forward. As I ran, I shut my eyes tight, 
expecting the blast any second. 

Could I get away in time? Were Meg and Briana escaping it too? 

I stopped short when I heard the laughter. 

Shrill, gleeful laughter. 

“Huh?” Swallowing hard, I turned back. 

And saw half the camp laughing at me. 

Meg and Briana slapped each other a high five. 

“No. Oh, noooo,” I murmured. How could I fall for such a dumb trick? 

How could they play such a mean joke on me? 

They must have told everyone to watch. As I stood at the edge of the 
clearing by myself, I could feel all the eyes on me. 

And I could hear kids laughing and making jokes. 

I saw Jan laughing. And I saw Richard and some of the other counselors 
grinning and shaking their heads. 

I know, I know. I should have laughed too. I should have made a joke of it. 

I shouldn’t have let it upset me. 

But the whole day had been so terrible. I was so nervous. And so eager not 
to make any more mistakes. 

I could feel my shoulders start to shake up and down. I could feel tears 
welling up in my eyes. 

No! I ordered myself. You cannot cry! You cannot allow yourself to cry in 
front of the whole camp. 

Sure, you feel like a total jerk, Sarah. But so what? It was just a joke. Just a 
dumb joke. 

I felt a hand on my arm. I pulled away. 



“Sarah—” Aaron stood beside me. His dark eyes were wide in the shadowy 
evening light. 

“I’m okay,” I snapped. “Go away.” 

“You’re such a bad sport,” he said softly. “Why can’t you ever let things 
slide off you? It was just a joke. Why go nuts over a dumb joke?” 

Do you know what I really hate? 

I really hate it when Aaron is right. 

I mean, he’s my younger brother—right? What right does he have to be the 
sensible, calm member of the Maas family? 

It really steams me when Aaron comes on like the older brother. 

“Do I need your advice?” I snarled. “Take a hike.” I gave him a shove 
toward the campfire. 

He shrugged and hurried back to his friends. 

I crept to the campfire. I didn’t go to my old seat. It was too close to the fire 
—and too close to Briana and Meg. 

I dropped down on the edge of a log near the woods, outside the glow of the 
fire. The darkness cooled me and helped to calm me down. 

Richard had been talking for a while. I realized I hadn’t heard a word he 

said. 

He stood in front of the crackling fire. He had a deep, booming voice. But 
everyone leaned in to hear him better. 

I gazed around the circle of campers. Their faces glowed orange in the 
bright firelight. Their eyes sparkled. 

I wondered if anyone here would be my friend. 

I knew I was feeling really sorry for myself. I wondered if any other new 
campers felt the way I did. 

Richard’s voice droned on in the back of my mind. He was saying 
something about the main lodge. Something about the meal schedule. Then he 
began talking about towels. 

I started to pay attention when he introduced the head waterfront counselor. 
Her name was Liz. 

Everyone clapped when she stood up beside Richard. One of the boys gave 
a loud wolf whistle. 

“She’s awesome!” another boy called out. 

Everyone laughed. 

Liz grinned too. She knew she looked really awesome. She wore tight 



denim cutoffs and a dark blue midriff top. She waved for everyone to get quiet. 

“Are you all having a good time?” she called out. 

Everyone cheered and clapped. Several boys whistled. 

“Well, tomorrow will be your first day at the waterfront,” Liz announced. 
“And before you go in the lake, there are lots of water rules we want you to 
know.” 

“Like, don’t drink the water!” Richard chimed in. “Unless you’re very 
thirsty!” 

Some kids laughed. I didn’t. The thought of drinking that disgusting, slimy 
water made me sick. 

Liz didn’t laugh, either. She frowned at Richard. “We need to take this 
seriously,” she scolded. 

“I was serious!” Richard joked. 

Liz ignored him. “When you get back to your bunks, you will find a list of 
water rules on your bed,” she continued, brushing back her long, frizzy red hair. 
“There are twenty rules on the list. And you need to know them all.” 

Huh? Twenty rules? I thought. How can there be twenty rules? 

It will take all summer to learn twenty rules. 

Liz held up a sheet of paper. “I’m going to go over the list with you now. If 
you have any questions, just call them out.” 

“Can we go swimming now?” a boy shouted, trying to be funny. 

Lots of kids laughed. 

But Liz didn’t crack a smile. “That’s rule number eight,” she replied. “No 
night swimming, even if counselors are with you.” 

“Don’t ever swim with counselors!” Richard joked. “They have germs!” 

Richard is pretty funny, I thought. He seems like a good guy. 

But Liz seems so serious. 

The sheet of paper fluttered in the wind. She gripped it with both hands. 
Her red hair caught the glow of the fire. 

“The most important rule at Camp Cold Lake is the Buddy System,” Liz 
announced. “When you are in the lake, you must always have a buddy.” 

She glanced quickly at the campers seated around her. “Even if you are only 
wading in up to your ankles, you must have a swimming buddy with you,” she 
said. “You may have a different buddy each time. Or you may choose a buddy 
for the whole summer. But you must always have a buddy.” 

She took a deep breath. “Are there any questions?” 



“Will you be my buddy?” a boy shouted. 

Everyone laughed. I laughed too. The kid’s timing was perfect. 

But once again, Liz didn’t crack a smile. “As waterfront counselor, I will 
act as everyone’s buddy,” she replied seriously. 

“Now, rule number two,” she continued. “Never swim more than three boat 
lengths from one of our safety boats. Rule number three—no shouting or 
pretending to be in trouble in the water. No horseplay. No kidding around. Rule 
number four...” 

She talked on and on, reading off all twenty rules. 

I groaned. She talks to us like we’re five year olds, I thought. 

And there are so many water rules. 

“Let me repeat one more time about the Buddy System...” Liz was saying. 

Gazing past the fire, I could see the dark lake. Smooth and black and silent. 

The lake has tiny waves. No current. No dangerous tides. 

So why are there so many rules? I wondered. 

What are they scared of? 



6 


Liz talked for at least half an hour. Richard kept cracking jokes, trying to make 
her laugh. But she never even smiled. 

She talked some more about every rule on the list. Then she told us to read 
the list carefully when we got back to our cabins. 

“Have a safe summer, everyone!” she called out. “See you at the 
waterfront!” 

Everyone cheered and whistled again as Liz stepped away from the fire. I 
yawned and stretched my hands over my head. That was really boring, I thought. 

Eve never heard of a place having so many rules. 

I swatted another mosquito on my neck. I was starting to feel really itchy. 
That’s what being outdoors does to me. It makes me itch like crazy. 

The fire had died down. A blanket of purple embers glowed on the dark 
ground. The night air grew cool. 

To end the campfire, Richard told everyone to stand and sing the camp 
song. “You new campers probably don’t know the words,” he said. “You’re 
lucky\” 

Everyone laughed. Then Richard began to sing, and everyone joined in. 

I tried to follow along. But I couldn’t catch all of the words. I picked up 
pieces of the song.... 

“Wetter is better ... ” 

“Get in the swim. 

Show your vigor and vim... ” 

“Every son and daughter 

should be in the water, 

the cold, cold water 

of Camp Cold Lake. ” 

Yuck. I agreed with Richard about the words to the song. They were so 
lame! 



Gazing across the fire, I saw Aaron singing his heart out. He seemed to 
know every word already. 

How does he do it? I wondered, scratching my itchy legs. How does he 
manage to be so perfect? To fit in everywhere? 

As the song ended, Richard raised his hands for quiet. “I have a few final 
announcements,” he called out. “First of all, none of you can carry a tune! 
Second...” 

I didn’t hear the rest. I turned to find Briana and Meg standing beside me. 

I took a step back. “What do you want?” I snapped. 

“We want to apologize,” Briana said. 

Meg nodded. “Yeah. We’re sorry we played that dumb joke on you.” 

Richard’s voice droned on behind us. Briana put a hand on my shoulder. 
“We got off to a bad start,” she said. “Let’s start all over again. Okay, Sarah?” 

“Yeah. Let’s start fresh,” Meg agreed. 

A smile spread over my face. “Great,” I said. “Excellent.” 

“Excellent!” Briana repeated, smiling too. 

She slapped me on the back. “A fresh start!” 

Richard was still making announcements. “Tomorrow at four-thirty, those 
interested in windsurfing...” 

Aaron will probably try that, I thought. I watched Briana and Meg walk 
away. 

A fresh start, I thought. I began to feel a lot happier. 

The happy feeling lasted for about two seconds. 

Then my back started to itch. 

I turned to the fire and saw Briana and Meg staring back at me. They were 
both giggling. 

Other kids had turned away from Richard and were watching me. 

“Ohhhh.” I groaned when I felt something warm wriggle against my back. 

Something warm and dry, moving under my T-shirt. 

“Ohhhh.” It moved again. 

I reached one hand back. And poked it under my shirt. 

What is it? What did Briana put back there? 

I grabbed the thing and pulled it out. 

And started to scream. 



7 


The snake wriggled in my hand. 

It looked like a long black shoelace. With eyes! And a mouth that kept 
snapping open and shut. 

“Noooooo!” I totally lost it. 

I let out a shrill scream. And I heaved the snake with all my might. 

It sailed into the woods. 

My back still itched like crazy. I could still feel it wriggling against my 

skin. 

I reached back and tried to scratch with both hands. 

Kids were laughing. Telling each other what Briana had done. 

I didn’t care. I just wanted to rub away the feeling of that snake against my 

skin. 

My whole body tingled. I uttered an angry cry. “How could you?” I 
shrieked at Briana and Meg. “What is your problem ?” 

Aaron came hurrying over to be the grown-up again. 

Just what I needed. Mr. Mature Kid Brother. 

“Sarah, did it bite you?” he asked softly. 

I shook my head. “I can still feel it!” I wailed. “Did you see it? It was three 
feet long!” 

“Calm down,” Aaron whispered. “Everyone is staring at you.” 

“Think I don’t know it?” I snapped. 

“Well, it was just a tiny snake,” Aaron said. “Totally harmless. Try to get 
yourself together.” 

“I—I—I—” I sputtered. I was too upset, too angry to talk. 

Aaron raised his eyes to Briana and Meg. “Why are those two girls picking 
on you?” he asked. 

“I don’t know!” I wailed. “Because... because they’re creeps ! That’s why!” 
“Well, try to calm down,” Aaron repeated. “Look at you, Sarah. You’re 
shaking all over.” 

“You’d shake too if you had a disgusting snake crawling up and down your 
skin!” I replied. “And I really don’t need your advice, Aaron. I really don’t—” 



“Fine,” he replied. He spun away and hurried back to his friends. 

“I don’t believe him,” I muttered. 

Dad is a doctor, and Aaron is just like him. He thinks he has to take care of 
everyone in the world. 

Well, I can take care of myself. I don’t need my little brother telling me to 
calm down every second. 

Richard was still talking. But I didn’t care. I stepped away from the 
campfire circle and started back to the cabin. 

The path curved through a patch of woods, up the sloping hill where the 
cabins were perched. Away from the glow of the fire, I was surrounded by 
darkness. 

I clicked on my flashlight and aimed the yellow circle of light at my feet. 
My sneakers crunched over dry leaves and twigs. The trees whispered above me. 

How did I get off to such a bad start? I asked myself. 

Why do Briana and Meg hate me so much? 

Maybe they’re just mean, I decided. Maybe they’re total creeps. Maybe 
they’re mean to everyone. 

They think they’re so hot because they were at camp last year. 

Without realizing it, I had wandered off the path. “Hey—” I swung the 
flashlight around, searching for the way back. 

The light swept over tilting trees, tall clumps of weeds, a fallen log. 

Panic tightened my throat. 

Where is the path? Where? 

I took a few steps. My sneaker crunched over leaves. 

And then my foot sank into something soft. 

Quicksand! 



8 


No. Not quicksand. 

There’s no such thing as quicksand. I remembered that from some science 
book I read in fifth grade. 

I lowered the flashlight. 

“Ohhhh.” Mud. Thick, gooey mud. 

My sneaker sank deep into the ooze. 

I pulled my leg up with a groan—and nearly toppled over backwards. 

It’s just mud, I told myself. It’s disgusting—but it’s no big deal. 

But then I saw the spiders. 

Dozens of them. The biggest spiders I ever saw. 

There must have been a nest of them in the mud. 

They were crawling over my shoe, crawling up the leg of my jeans. 

“Ohhhh. Yuck!” 

Dozens of spiders clung to me. I shook my sneaker. Hard. Then I began 
batting at them with my free hand. 

“I hate this caaaaaamp!” I screamed. 

I beat some spiders away with the flashlight. 

And then I had an idea. 

I mean, why shouldn’t I pay Briana and Meg back for what they did to me? 

They embarrassed me in front of the whole camp. And I hardly did 
anything to them. 

I emptied the batteries from the flashlight. I took a deep breath. Then I bent 
down—and scooped a bunch of spiders into the flashlight. 

Yuck. I felt sick. I really did. 

I mean, can you imagine —me handling spiders! 

But I knew it would be worth it. Soon. 

I filled the flashlight with the squirming, black creatures. Then I screwed on 
the top. 

I stepped over a fallen tree trunk. Found the path. And carrying the 
flashlight carefully, I eagerly hurried to the cabin. 

I stopped outside the door. The lights were on inside the cabin. 



I peeked in through the open window. No. No sign of anyone. 

I crept inside. 

I pulled up the blanket on Briana’s bed. Then I emptied half of the spiders 
onto her sheet. I carefully pulled the blanket over them and smoothed it out. 

I was pouring the rest of the spiders into Meg’s bed when I heard a 
shuffling noise behind me. Quickly, I pulled Meg’s blanket back into place and 
spun around. 

Jan stepped into the cabin. “What’s up?” she asked in her hoarse, croaky 
voice. 

“Nothing,” I replied, hiding the flashlight behind my back. 

Jan yawned. “It’s Lights Out in ten minutes,” she said. 

I glanced at Briana’s bunk. I’d left one corner of the blanket untucked. 
Briana won’t notice, I decided. 

I realized I was grinning. I quickly changed my expression. I didn’t want 
Jan asking a lot of questions. 

She turned and pulled a long white nightshirt from her dresser drawer. 
“What did you sign up for tomorrow?” she asked. “Free Swim?” 

“No. Canoeing,” I told her. 

I wanted to be in a nice, dry canoe. Not flopping around in the dirty lake 
with fish and other slimy creatures. 

“Hey. Me too,” Jan said. 

I started to ask if she would be my buddy. But Briana and Meg came 
strolling through the door. 

They saw me—and burst out laughing. 

“What was that wild dance you were doing at the campfire?” Briana teased. 

“You looked as if you had a snake down your back or something!” Meg 
declared. 

They laughed some more. 

That’s okay I thought. Go ahead and laugh. 

In a few minutes, when you climb under your covers, I’ll be laughing. 

I couldn’t wait.

A few minutes later, Jan turned out the lights. I lay on the hard mattress, staring 
up at Meg’s mattress above my head, grinning. Waiting... 

Waiting... 

Meg shifted her weight in the bunk above me. 

I heard her gasp. 

And then both Briana and Meg began to scream. 

I laughed out loud. I couldn’t hold it in. 

“It bit me! It bit me!” Briana howled. 

The lights flashed on. 

“Help!” Meg cried. She leaped out of bed. Her bare feet hit the floor hard. It 
sounded like an elephant landing. 

“It bit me!” Briana cried. 

She and Meg were both on the floor now, dancing and wriggling. Slapping 
at their arms, their legs, their backs. 

I bit my lip to make myself stop laughing. 

“Spiders! Spiders all over!” Meg shrieked. “Ow! It bit me too!” She pulled 
up the sleeve of her nightshirt. “Ow! That hurts!” 

Jan stood at the light switch. I hadn’t moved from my bed. I was enjoying it 
all too much. Watching them squirm and dance. 

But Jan’s words wiped the smile from my face. 

“Sarah put the spiders there,” she told Briana and Meg. “I saw her messing 
around at your bunks when I came in.” 

What a snitch. I guess she was still angry at me because I spilled her asthma 
medicine. 

Well, that put an end to the fun. 

I think Briana and Meg wanted to strangle me. They both had to go to the 
infirmary and wake up the camp nurse. They had to make sure the spider bites 
weren’t poisonous. 

How was I to know that these were the kind of spiders that bite? 

It was just a joke, after all. 

I tried to apologize when they came trudging back from the nurse. But they 



wouldn’t speak to me. And neither would Jan. 

Oh, well, I sighed. So they won’t be my friends. I’ll make other friends.... 

The next morning in the mess hall, I ate breakfast alone. The room had two long 
tables that stretched from wall to wall. One for boys and one for girls. 

I sat at the far end of the girls’ table and spooned up my cornflakes in 
silence. 

All the other girls were chattering away. At the other end of the table, 
Briana and Meg kept flashing me angry looks. 

I saw Aaron at the boys’ table. He and his friends were laughing and 
goofing on each other. Aaron balanced a pancake on his forehead. Another boy 
slapped it off. 

At least he ’s having fun, I thought bitterly. 

I had the sudden urge to go over and tell Aaron how unhappy I was. But I 
knew he would just tell me to lighten up. 

So I sat at my lonely end of the table and choked down my cornflakes. 

Did things get better when I arrived at the lake for canoeing? 

Three guesses. 

Kids were already pulling their canoes off the grassy shore, into the water. 
They all seemed to be paired up. 

Liz walked over to me. Her white one-piece bathing suit glowed in the 
morning sunlight. She had her frizzy red hair tied behind her head. 

She let a silver whistle fall from her mouth. “What’s your name?” she 
asked, eyes on the lake. 

“Sarah,” I told her. “I signed up for canoeing, but—” 

“You need a buddy,” she said. “Find a buddy. The canoes are over there.” 
She pointed, then trotted away. 

Canoes splashed into the water. The slap of the wooden paddles echoed 
around the shore. 

I ran to the stack of canoes, searching for a buddy. But everyone had 
already chosen partners. 

I was about to give up when I spotted Jan, pulling a canoe to the water. “Do 
you have a buddy?” I called. 

She shook her head. 

“Well, can I come with you?” I asked. 

“I don’t think so,” she replied nastily. “Do you have any more spiders you 



want to set loose?” 

“Jan, please—” I started. 

“Are you two together?” Liz appeared behind us, startling us both. 

“No. I—” Jan started. 

“I want to be her buddy, but she doesn’t want to,” I said. I didn’t mean to 
whine, but it came out that way. 

Jan made an ugly face at me. 

“Get your canoe in the water,” Liz ordered. “You two are the last ones in.” 

Jan started to protest. Then she shrugged and sighed. “Okay, Sarah. Let’s 

go-” 

We pulled on life preservers. Then I grabbed a paddle and one end of the 
canoe. We dragged it to the water. 

The little boat bobbed against the shore. The lake current was stronger than 
I thought. Low waves plopped steadily against the grassy shore. 

Jan climbed in and took a seat in the front. “Thanks for embarrassing me in 
front of Liz,” she muttered. 

“I didn’t mean—” I started. 

“Okay. Push off,” she commanded. 

I tossed my paddle into the canoe. Then I leaned over and gave the boat a 
hard shove with both hands. 

It slid smoothly away from the shore. Then I had to wade out to it and pull 
myself inside. 

“Whoa!” As I struggled to hoist myself up, the canoe nearly tipped over. 

“Watch it!” Jan snapped. “You’re such a klutz, Sarah.” 

“Sorry,” I murmured. I was so grateful to have a buddy, I didn’t want any 
more trouble between us. 

I pulled myself into the canoe and dropped down behind Jan. 

The canoe bobbed up and down as we began to paddle. The rocking waters 
sparkled like silver under the bright morning sunshine. 

It took us a while to find the right rhythm. 

Neither of us spoke. 

The slap of our paddles and the rush of water against the little canoe were 
the only sounds we made. 

The lake gleamed in front of us like a giant, round mirror. I could see 
several canoes up ahead. Jan and I were far behind them. 

The rubber life preservers were hot and heavy. We pulled them off and 



dropped them to the canoe floor. 

We paddled steadily, not too fast, not too slow. 

I glanced back. The shore seemed miles away. 

I felt a chill of fear. I’m not that strong a swimmer. I suddenly wondered if I 
could swim all the way to shore from out here. 

“Hey!” As I stared back at the shore, the canoe suddenly started to rock. 
“Whoooa!” I grabbed the sides. 

I turned—and to my horror, saw Jan standing up\ 

“Jan—stop! What are you doing?” I shrieked. “What are you doing?” 

The little boat rocked harder. I gripped the sides, struggling to steady it. 

Jan took a step. 

The canoe tilted. Water splashed over my feet. 

“Jan—stop!” I cried again. “Sit down! What are you doing?” 

She narrowed her eyes at me. “Bye, Sarah.” 



10 


The boat tilted more as she raised one foot to the side. She pulled off the T-shirt 
she had over her swimsuit and tossed it to the canoe floor. 

“No—please!” I begged. “Don’t leave me out here. I’m not a good 
swimmer. What if the boat tips over? I don’t think I can swim back from here!” 

“You ruined my summer,” she accused. “Now everyone knows I have 
asthma. So they won’t let me go on the six-day canoe trip.” 

“But—but it was an accident—” I sputtered. 

“And you’re messing up everything for Briana and Meg too,” Jan said 
angrily. 

“No. Wait—” I started. “I apologized to them. I didn’t mean—” 

She shifted her weight. 

Tilted the canoe the other way. 

Then she shifted her weight again. Again. 

Deliberately making the canoe rock. 

Deliberately trying to frighten me. 

“Don’t tip it over, Jan. Please—” I pleaded. 

She tilted it more. Made it rock so hard, I thought I’d tumble out. 

“I’m really not a good swimmer,” I repeated. “I really don’t think I—” 

She uttered a disgusted groan. Then she tossed back her hair. Raised her 
arms over her head. Bent her knees. Kicked off hard. 

And dove into the lake. 

“Noooo!” I let out a cry as the boat rocked violently. Jan’s dive sent up a 
tall, foamy wave of water. 

The canoe tilted... rocked... 

...and flipped over! 

I hit with a smack. Cold water rose up around me as I sank. 

Frozen in shock. 

I felt the canoe bounce above me on the surface. 

Then I started to choke as water invaded my nose and mouth. 

Sputtering and gagging, I thrashed my arms and legs. 

Pushed myself... pushed... pushed myself to the surface. 



And raised my head over the bobbing current. 

Still sputtering, I sucked in a deep breath of fresh air. Then another. 

Floating on the surface, I saw the canoe bobbing upside down on the water. 

I struggled to catch my breath, to slow my racing heart. 

Then I swam to the canoe. I grabbed on to it. Wrapped one arm around it. 
Held on for dear life. 

Bobbing with the canoe, I squinted into the sunlight, searching for Jan. 

“Jan? Jan?” I called to her. 

“Jan? Where are you?” 

I turned and searched in all directions. 

A feeling of cold dread tightened my chest. 

“Jan? Jan? Can you hear me?” I shouted. 



11 


I held on to the canoe with one hand and shielded my eyes with the other. “Jan? 
Jan?” I shouted her name as loudly as I could. 

And then I spotted her. 

I saw her blond hair glowing in the bright sunlight. And I saw her red 
swimsuit. Her arms moving steadily, smoothly. Her feet kicking up foamy 
waves. 

She was making her way to shore. 

She swam away and left me here, I realized. 

I turned and searched for the other canoes. Squinting against the sun, I 
could see them far ahead of me. Too far away to hear my shouts. 

Maybe I can turn the canoe over, I decided. Then I can climb in and paddle 
back to shore. 

But where were the paddles? 

I raised my eyes to the camp—and saw Jan talking to Liz. She was waving 
her arms frantically and pointing out to the water. Pointing to me. 

A crowd of kids gathered around them. I could hear excited voices. Shouts 
and cries. 

I saw Liz pull a canoe into the water. 

She’s coming to rescue me, I realized. Jan must have told her I couldn’t 
swim all the way back. 

I suddenly felt embarrassed. I knew all the kids on shore were watching me. 
I knew they were talking about what a wimp I must be. 

But I didn’t care. I just wanted to get back on dry land. 

It didn’t take Liz long to paddle out to me. When I pulled myself into the 
canoe, I started to thank her. 

But she didn’t let me get a word out. “Why did you do it, Sarah?” she 
demanded. 

“Excuse me?” I gasped. “Do what?” 

“Why did you tip the canoe over?” Liz asked. 

I opened my mouth to protest—but only a squeak came out. 

Liz frowned at me. “Jan says you deliberately tipped over the canoe. Don’t 
you know how dangerous that is, Sarah?” 



“But—but—but—!” 

“I’m calling a special camp meeting because of this,” Liz said. “Water 
safety is so important. The water safety rules must be followed at all times. 
Camp Cold Lake couldn’t exist if campers didn’t follow every rule.” 

“I wish it didn’t exist,” I muttered unhappily. 


* * * 


So Liz held a long meeting at the lodge. And everyone at camp had to be there. 

She went over the rules of water safety again. Rule by rule. 

And then she showed an endless slide show about the Buddy System. 

I sat way on the side and stared down at the floor. But every time I raised 
my eyes, I saw Briana, Meg, and Jan glaring angrily at me. 

Other campers kept staring at me too. I guess they all blamed me for this 
long, boring meeting. Jan probably told everyone in camp that I was the one who 
tipped over the canoe. 

“I want you to memorize all twenty water safety rules,” Liz was saying. 

More campers stared angrily at me. 

Everyone hates me, I thought, shaking my head sadly. And there is nothing 
I can do about it. 

Then, suddenly, I had an idea. 



12 


“I’m going to run away,” I told Aaron. 

“Good-bye,” he said calmly. “Good luck.” 

“No. Really!” I insisted. “I’m not kidding. I’m really going to run away 
from this camp.” 

“Send me a postcard,” Aaron said. 

I had dragged him away from the mess hall after dinner. I really needed to 
talk to him. I pulled him to the edge of the lake. 

No one else was down here. Everyone was still at the mess hall in the 
lodge. 

I glanced at the canoes, stacked in piles of three near the water. I pictured 
Jan’s blond hair, her red swimsuit. I pictured her swimming away, leaving me in 
the middle of the lake. 

And then lying to Liz. Getting me in trouble.... 

I shook Aaron by the shoulders. “Why won’t you take me seriously?” I 
cried through clenched teeth. 

He laughed. 

“You shouldn’t shake a person after they’ve just eaten the camp meat loaf.” 
He let out a loud burp. 

“You’re so gross.” I groaned. 

He grinned. “It’s a family tradition.” 

“Stop joking around. I mean it,” I snapped. “I’m really unhappy, Aaron. I 
hate this camp. There is no phone here we can use. I can’t call Mom and Dad. So 
I’m going to run away.” 

His expression changed. He saw that I was serious. 

He skipped a flat stone across the water. I watched the ripples spread out, 
then disappear. 

The lake reflected the gray evening sky. Everything was gray. The ground, 
the sky, the water. Reflections of trees shimmered darkly in the gray water. 

“Where are you going to run?” Aaron asked softly. I could see him quickly 
becoming the mature, “wiser” brother again. But I didn’t care. 

I had to tell him my plan. I couldn’t leave camp without letting him know. 

“Through the woods,” I said. I pointed. “There is a town on the other side 



of the woods. When I get to the town, I’m going to call Mom and Dad and tell 
them to come get me.” 

“You can’t!” Aaron protested. 

I stuck my chin out. “Why not?” 

“We’re not allowed in the woods,” he replied. “Richard said the woods 
were dangerous—remember?” 

I shoved Aaron again. I was so tense, so angry, I didn’t know what to do 
with my hands. 

“I don’t care what Richard said!” I bellowed. “I’m running away— 
remember?” 

“Give the camp a chance, Sarah,” Aaron urged. “We haven’t even been here 
a whole week. Give the place a chance.” 

That’s when I totally lost it. 

“I hate it when you’re so sensible!” I screamed. 

I shoved him hard. With both hands. 

His mouth flew open. He lost his balance—and toppled into the lake. 

He landed on his back in the wet mud just past the shore. 

“Ooof!” I heard the air shoot out of him. 

“Sorry—” I started. “It was an accident, Aaron. I—” 

He scrambled to his feet, pulling up greasy gunk and seaweed with him. 
Shaking his fists. Calling me all kinds of names. 

I sighed. Now even my brother was furious at me. 

What am I going to do? I asked myself. What can I do? 

As I trudged back to the cabin, another plan began to form in my mind. 

A really desperate plan. 

A really dangerous plan. 

“Tomorrow,” I murmured to myself, “I’m going to show them all!” 



13 


I thought about my plan all the next morning. I was frightened—but I knew I had 
to go through with it. 

Our group had Free Swim that afternoon. Of course, everyone had a buddy 
but me. 

I dug my bare feet into the muddy shore and watched everyone pair up and 
head into the water. Puffy white clouds floated overhead, reflected in the nearly 
still water. 

Tiny gnats jumped over the surface of the water. I stared at them, 
wondering why they didn’t get wet. 

“Sarah, it’s swim time,” Liz called. She hurried over to me. She wore a pink 
one-piece bathing suit under crisp white tennis shorts. 

I adjusted my swimsuit top. My hands were trembling. 

I really was scared by what I planned to do. 

“Why aren’t you swimming?” Liz demanded. She brushed a fly off my 
shoulder. 

“I—I don’t have a buddy,” I stammered. 

She glanced around, trying to find someone for me. But everyone was in 
the lake. 

“Well...” Liz twisted her mouth fretfully. “Go ahead and swim by yourself. 
Stay close to the shore. And I’ll keep an eye on you.” 

“Great. Thanks,” I said. I smiled at her, then trotted enthusiastically to the 
edge of the water. 

I didn’t want her to guess that it wasn’t going to be a normal swim for me. 
That I had something really terrible in mind.... 

I stepped into the water. 

Oooh. So cold. 

A cloud rolled over the sun. The sky darkened, and the air grew colder. 

My feet sank into the muddy bottom of the lake. Up ahead, I saw the gnats 
—hundreds of them—hopping on the water. 

Yuck, I thought. Why do I have to swim with mud and gnats? 

I took a deep breath and stepped out farther. When the cold water was 
nearly up to my waist, I lowered my body in and started to swim. 



I swam a few long laps. I needed to get used to the water. And I needed to 
get my breathing steady. 

A short distance away, Briana and some other girls were having some kind 
of relay race. They were laughing and cheering. Having a great time. 

They won’t be laughing in a few minutes. I told myself bitterly. 

A tall spray of water rushed over me. I cried out. 

Another wave smacked my face. 

It took me a few seconds to realize that I was being splashed—by Aaron. 

He rose up in front of me—and spit a stream of water into my face. 

“Yuck! How can you put this water in your mouth?” I cried, totally grossed 
out. 

He laughed and splashed away to join his buddy. 

He won’t be laughing in a few minutes, either, I told myself. He’ll treat me 
differently after today. 

Everyone will. 

I suddenly felt guilty. I should have told Aaron what I planned to do. I 
didn’t really want to scare him. I wanted to scare everyone else. 

But I knew if I told my plan to practical, sensible Aaron, he would talk me 
out of it. Or go tell Liz so that she would stop me. 

Well... no one is going to stop me, I vowed. 

Have you guessed my desperate plan? 

It was really quite simple. 

I planned to drown myself. 

Well... not really. 

I planned to dive down to the lake bottom. Stay under. A long, long time. 
And make everyone think that I had drowned. 

I can hold my breath for a very long time. It’s because I play the flute. I’ve 
really developed my lung power. 

I can probably stay underwater for two or three minutes. 

Long enough to scare everyone to death. 

Everyone will panic. Even Briana, Meg, and Jan. 

Everyone will feel sorry for how mean they were to me. 

I’ll get a new start. After my close call in the lake, everyone in camp will 
want to be nice to me. 

Everyone will want to be my buddy. 

So... here goes. 



I took one last look at all the laughing, shouting swimmers. 
Then I sucked in the biggest breath I had ever taken. 

And plunged down, down to the bottom of the lake. 



14 


The lake was shallow for only a few feet. Then the lake bottom gave way in a 
steep drop. 

I kicked hard, pushing myself away from the other swimmers. Then I pulled 
myself upright, lowering my feet. 

Yes. 

I dropped my hands to my sides and let myself sink. 

Down, down. 

I opened my eyes as I dropped to the lake bottom. I saw only green. Waves 
of pale light shimmered through the green. 

I’m floating inside an emerald, I thought. Floating down, down in a 
sparkling green jewel. 

I pictured the tiny emerald on the ring Mom wore every day. Her 
engagement ring. I thought about Mom and Dad, thought how sad they’d be if I 
really did drown. 

We never should have sent Sarah to that water sports camp, they would say. 

My feet hit the soft lake floor. 

A bubble of air escaped my mouth. I pressed my lips tighter, holding the air 
inside. 

I slowly floated up toward the surface. 

I closed my eyes. I kept my whole body still to make it look as if I’d 
drowned. 

I pictured the horror on Liz’s face when she saw my body floating so still, 
floating under the water, my hair bobbing on the surface. 

I almost laughed when I thought of Liz leaping into the lake to rescue me, 
having to get her crisp white tennis shorts wet, I forced myself to remain still. 

I shut my eyes even tighter. And thought about Briana, Meg, and Jan. 

They’ll feel so guilty They’ll never forgive themselves for the way they 
treated me. 

After my close call, they’ll see how mean they were. And they’ll want to be 
best friends with me. 

We’ll all be best friends. 

And we’ll have a great summer together. 



My chest began to feel tight. The back of my throat began to burn. 

I opened my lips and let out a few more bubbles of air. 

But my throat still burned, and so did my chest. 

I floated facedown. I kept my legs stiff and let my arms hang loosely at my 
sides. 

I listened for shouts of alarm. 

Someone must have spotted me by now. 

I listened for cries of help. For kids calling Liz. 

But I heard only silence. The heavy silence you hear when you’re 
underwater. 

I let out another bubble of air. 

My chest really hurt now. It felt about to explode. 

I opened my eyes. Was anyone nearby? Was anyone coming to rescue me? 

I saw only green. 

Where is everyone? I wondered. 

Liz must have spotted me by now. Why isn’t she pulling me up out of the 
water? 

I pictured her again in her white tennis shorts. I pictured her tanned arms 
and legs. I pictured her red hair. 

Liz—where are you? 

Liz—don’t you see me drowning here? You said you’d keep an eye on me, 
remember? 

I can’t stay under much longer. 

My chest is ready to explode. My whole body is tingling. Burning. My head 
feels about to pop open. 

Can’t anyone see me here ? 

A wave of dizziness swept over me. 

I shut my eyes, but the dizziness didn’t go away. 

I pushed out the rest of the air in my lungs. 

No air, I thought. No air left.... 

My arms and legs ached. 

My chest burned. 

With my eyes closed, I saw bright yellow spots. 

Dancing yellow lights. They grew brighter... brighter. They did a fast, 
furious dance all around me. 



Around my burning, tingling body. 

My chest... exploding... exploding... 

I’m so cold, I realized. Suddenly, I feel so cold. 

The dancing, darting yellow lights grew brighter. Bright as spotlights. 
Bright as flashbulbs, flashing in my eyes. 

Flashing around my still, cold body. 

I shuddered from the cold. 

Shuddered again. 

Cold, thick water filled my mouth. 

I’ve stayed under too long, I realized. 

No one is coming. No one is coming to save me. 

Too long... too long. 

I struggled to see. But the lights were too bright. 

Can’t see. Can’t see. 

I swallowed another mouthful of water. 

Can’t see. Can’t breathe. 

I can’t stay under any longer. I can’t wait any longer. 

I struggled to raise my head out of the water. But it felt so heavy. It weighed 
a ton. 

Can’t stay down... 

Can’t breathe. 

With a burst of strength, I moved my shoulders. Pulled them up. 

Hoisted up my head. 

So heavy... so heavy. My hair filled with water. My hair so heavy. The 
water running down my face. 

Over my eyes. 

I turned to shore. Squinted through the bright, darting lights. 

Squinted hard through the water running down my face. 

Squinted... 

No one there. 

I turned again. My eyes searched the water. 

No one there. No one swimming. No one on the shore. 

Where is everyone ? I wondered. Shivering. Shuddering. 

Where did everyone go? 



15 


I struggled to shore. 

My feet were numb. I couldn’t feel the muddy bottom as I staggered out of 
the water. 

I rubbed my arms. I couldn’t feel the touch of my hands. Couldn’t feel the 
water pouring off me, running down my back. 

Couldn’t feel anything. Numb. Numb all over. 

“Where is everyone?” I called. 

But did I make a sound? Did I have a voice? 

I couldn’t hear myself. 

I stepped onto the grass and shook myself. Like a dog trying to get dry. 
Trying to shake some feeling into my cold, numb body. 

“Where did you all go?” 

Hugging myself, I stumbled forward. I stopped when I saw the canoes. All 
tacked upside down by the shore and tied up. 

Weren’t kids canoeing today? Weren’t the canoes all out in the lake? 

“Hey!” I shouted. 

But why couldn’t I hear my shout? 

“Where is everyone?” 

No one on the shore. 

I spun around, nearly losing my balance. No one in the water. 

No one. No one anywhere. 

I stumbled past the life preservers and rubber rafts. Covered with a canvas 

tarp. 

Isn’t anyone going to use them? I wondered. Why are they covered up? 

Why did everyone leave the lake so quickly? 

Shivering, hugging myself, I made my way toward the lodge. I gasped 
when I noticed the trees. 

Bare. All winter bare. 

“Noooooooo!” a frightened wail escaped my throat. A silent wail. 

Could anyone hear me? 

When had the leaves fallen? Why had they fallen in the middle of summer? 



I started to trot along the path to the lodge. Cold. So cold. 

Something stung my shoulder. Something tingled my eyelids. 

Snow? 

Yes. Tiny white flakes drifted down, blown by a steady breeze. The bare 
trees rattled and creaked. 

I brushed snowflakes from my wet hair. 

Snow? 

But I knew that was impossible. 

All impossible. 

“Heeeeeeey!” My shout echoed through the trees. Or did it? 

Could anyone hear my frightened call? 

“Hellllllllllp!” I shouted. “Somebody hellllllp me!” 

Silence, except for the creaking tree limbs overhead. 

I started to run again. My bare feet moved silently over the cold ground. 

The cabins came into view as I made my way out of the trees. Their flat 
roofs were covered by a thin layer of snow. 

The ground was as gray as the sky. The cabins were all dark, the shingled 
walls gray. Gray all around me. 

A cold world of gray. 

I pushed open the door of the first cabin I came to. “Hey—I need help!” I 
cried. 

I stared into the empty room. 

No one there. No camp trunks. No clothes scattered about. 

I raised my eyes to the bunk beds against the wall. The blankets, the sheets 
—the mattresses—had all been taken away. 

I guess this cabin isn’t being used, I thought. 

I backed out of the door. Turned and ran down the row of cabins. All dark 
and silent. 

My cabin stood where the path curved up the hill. With a sigh of relief, I ran 
up to it and pushed open the door. 

“Briana? Meg?” 

Empty. And dark. 

The mattresses gone. The posters pulled down. No clothes. No bags or 
trunks. 

No sign that anyone had ever lived in here. 

“Where are you?” I shrieked. 



And then, “Where am I?” 

Where was my stuff? Where was my bed? 

Uttering another terrified wail, I lurched out of the cabin. 

Cold. So cold and numb. Running through the cold in my wet bathing suit. 

I tore through the camp. Pulling open doors. Peering into bare, empty 
rooms. Calling. Calling for someone—anyone—to help me. 

Into the main lodge. My cries echoing off the high, wooden rafters. 

Or did they? Was I really making a sound? 

Why couldn’t I hear myself? 

I burst into the mess hall. The long, wooden benches had been stacked on 
top of the tables. The kitchen stood dark and empty. 

What has happened? I wondered, unable to stop my trembling. 

Where did everyone go? Why did they all leave? How did they leave so 
quickly? How can it be snowing? 

I stumbled back out into the gray cold. Wisps of gray fog floated low over 
the gray ground. I hugged my frozen body, trying to warm myself. 

Terrified and confused, I wandered from building to building. I felt as if I 
were swimming again. Swimming in the thick gray mists. Swimming through 
endless layers of gray. 

And then I stopped when I heard a voice. 

A tiny voice. A girl’s voice. 

Singing. 

She was singing in a high, frail voice. 

“I’m not alone!” I cried. 

I listened to her song. A sad song sung so softly. 

And then I called out to her, “Where are you? I can’t see you! Where are 
you?” 



16 


I followed the tiny voice to the lodge. I saw a girl perched on the wooden steps. 

“Hey!” I called. “Hey! I was looking for someone! Can you help me?” 

She kept singing, as if she didn’t see me. As I walked closer, I realized she 
was singing the Camp Cold Lake song in her tiny, light voice. 

She had long curls of white-blond hair that flowed down the sides of her 
face. A pretty face, delicate and pale. So incredibly pale. 

She wore a sleeveless white T-shirt and white short shorts. Snowflakes fell 
all around us. I shivered. But she didn’t seem to notice the cold. 

She tilted her head from side to side as she sang. Her round blue eyes stared 
out at the sky. They reminded me of shiny blue marbles in her pale, pale face. 

I stepped up in front of her. I brushed snowflakes from my forehead. 

She didn’t turn to me until her song was finished. Then she smiled. “Hi, 
Sarah.” Her speaking voice was as soft as her singing. 

“How—how do you know my name?” I stammered. 

Her smile grew wider. “I’ve been waiting for you,” she replied. “My name 
is Della.” 

“Della—I’m so cold,” I blurted out. 

She rose to her feet. Turned. And pulled something out from behind the 
steps. 

A white bathrobe. 

She held it up and slipped it around my trembling shoulders. 

Her hands were so light. I could barely feel them. 

She helped me tie the belt. Then she stepped back and smiled at me again. 
“I’ve been waiting for you, Sarah,” she said. Her voice was a sigh, a whisper. 

“Excuse me?” I cried. “Waiting—?” 

She nodded. Her white-blond hair fluttered with every move of her head. “I 
can’t leave without you, Sarah. I need a buddy.” 

I stared at her, trying to understand. 

“Where is everyone?” I cried. “Where did everyone go? Why are you the 
only one here?” I bmshed snowflakes from my eyebrows. “Della, how did it get 
to be winter?” 



“You’ll be my buddy—won’t you, Sarah?” Her blue eyes burned into mine. 
Her hair glowed around her pale face. 

I blinked. “I don’t understand—” I started. “Please answer my questions.” 
“You’ll be my buddy, won’t you?” she repeated, pleading with those 
amazing eyes. “I’ve waited so long for a buddy, Sarah. So long.” 

“But, Della—” 

She started to sing again. 

I shoved my hands into the pockets of the robe. I shivered. I couldn’t get 
warm. I couldn’t stop shaking. 

Why was she singing the Camp Cold Lake song so sadly? 

Why wouldn’t she answer my questions? 

How did she know my name? And why did she say she’d been waiting for 

me? 

“Della, please—” I begged. 

Singing her strange, sad song, she floated up the wooden stairs to the lodge. 
Her hair shimmered, golden in the gray light. Swirls of fog curled around her as 
she moved. 

“Oh!” I cried out when I realized I could see right through her. 

“Della—?” 

She floated over the stairs, tilting her head from side to side, singing in that 
breathy whisper of a voice. 

“Della—?” 

She stopped singing and smiled at me again. Snowflakes covered her blond 
hair. The fog still swirled around her. 

I could see the dark shingles of the lodge through her body. I stared right 
through her. 

“Sarah, you’re my buddy now,” she whispered. “I need a buddy. Everyone 
at Camp Cold Lake needs a buddy.” 

“But—but you ’re dead\” I blurted out. 

Della is dead, I realized. 

And I’m her buddy. 

That means... 

That means that I’m dead tool 



17 


Della floated over me. So light and pale. The wind fluttered her hair. It rose 
around her like a shimmering halo. 

“You’re dead,” I murmured. “And I am too.” 

Saying the words sent a cold shudder down my body. 

I began to realize the truth. I began to see what had happened. 

Della had probably drowned here. Drowned in the lake. 

That is why everyone at the camp is so crazy about water safety. 

That explains the endless water safety lectures. And the long list of rules. 
And why the counselors insist on the Buddy System at ah times. 

Della drowned here. 

And now I’m her buddy. 

I’m her buddy—because I drowned too. 

“Noooooooooo!” Along wail of horror, of disbelief, escaped my throat. 

I threw my head back and wailed like an animal. Wailed out my sorrow. 

Della floated over me, watching me. Waiting for me to stop. She knew what 
I was thinking. She knew I had figured everything out. 

She waited patiently. How long had she been waiting there for me? Waiting 
for a buddy? Another dead buddy? 

How long had she been waiting for another unlucky girl to drown? 

“Noooo!” I moaned. “No, I won’t do it, Della! I can’t do it! I won’t be your 
buddy! I won’t!” 

I spun around. So dizzy, I nearly dropped to my knees. 

I started to run. The white robe flew open. It flapped beside me like wings 
as I ran away from her. 

Ran barefoot over the snowy ground. 

Ran through the swirls of fog. Through the gray. 

“Come back, Sarah!” I heard Della call to me. “Come back! You have to be 
my buddy! I’m trapped here. Trapped as a ghost. I can’t leave this camp—I can’t 
get to the other world—without a buddy!” 

But I didn’t stop. I kept running through the camp. Past the cabins. Past the 
supply sheds at the edge of the woods. 



I kept running from her calls. Running from her ghostly voice. 

I don’t want to be her buddy, I told myself. I don’t want to be a ghost ! 

I blinked away snowflakes as I ran. Ran through the bare, creaking trees. 
Ran without looking back. 

I stopped when I reached the lake shore. Stopped when I felt the cold water 
lap over my feet. 

The cold, gray water. 

I struggled to catch my breath. But my chest hurt. Felt about to explode. 
Gasping, I turned—and saw Della floating through the trees. Floating 
toward me, her eyes glowing with blue fire. 

“You can’t leave without me, Sarah!” she called. “You can’t leave, Sarah!” 

I turned away from her. Turned back to the water. 

My chest. My head. 

Everything hurt so much. 

I couldn’t breathe. 

My chest was going to burst. 

I sank to the mud. 

As the gray faded to black. 



18 


Pinpricks of white light danced above me. 

I thought of fireflies, darting above the grass late at night. 

The tiny lights grew brighter. Round, like flashlight beams. 

Brighter still. 

Until I was staring into a glowing ball of gold. 

I blinked. 

It took me a long while to realize that I was staring up at the sun. 

I turned my head away. 

I suddenly felt heavy. I could feel the ground beneath me. I could feel the 
weight of my body on the ground. 

My body. My solid body, coming back to me. 

I heard a groan. Someone moved above me. 

I blinked several times. And squinted up at Liz. 

Her face was red. Her mouth was twisted in a hard scowl. 

“Ohhh.” I groaned as she pressed both hands on my chest. Raised her 
hands. Pressed again. 

I felt water slide from my open mouth. 

I choked. Felt more water pour down my chin. 

“She’s coming around,” Liz announced. She pressed hard on my chest 
again. “She’s alive!” Liz cried. 

Behind her, I could see bare legs. Swimsuits. Campers. 

Yes. The other campers. 

I groaned again. Liz continued to work over me. 

I’m lying on my back, I realized. I’m on the lake shore. Liz is giving me 
CPR. 

The other campers are standing around me. Watching. Watching Liz save 
my life. 

“I’m—ALIVE!” The word burst from my throat. 

I sat up. And gazed around. 

Everyone is back! I realized. It’s summer again. The leaves are back on the 
trees. The sun is beaming down. 



And everyone is back. Including me! 

Liz uttered a sigh and sank back on her knees. “Sarah, are you okay?” she 
asked breathlessly. She mopped sweat from her forehead with the back of her 
hand. “Are you okay?” 

“I... I think so,” I murmured. 

I had a sour taste in my mouth. I still felt a little dizzy. 

Behind Liz, some campers cheered and applauded. 

“We thought you were gone for a moment.” Liz sighed. “You stopped 
breathing. What a scare!” 

Two counselors helped me to my feet. I tried to shake off my dizziness. 
“I’m okay!” I cried. “Thank you, Liz. You—you saved my life!” 

I hugged Liz. Then I turned and hugged Aaron. 

Briana and Meg were standing nearby. I startled them by hugging them too. 

I was so happy to be alive! So happy to be away from that gray, gray winter. 
Away from that frightening ghost girl in the empty camp. 

“Sarah—what happened?” Liz asked, placing a hand on my still-wet 
shoulder. She gently brushed back my hair. 

“I’m not sure,” I told her. “I’m really not sure.” 

Liz shuddered. “When you stopped breathing, I... I got so scared.” 

“I’m fine now,” I told her with a smile. “Thanks to you.” 

“She did it for attention,” I heard someone mutter. 

I turned—and saw Jan whispering to another girl. “Now everyone has to 
say ‘Poor Sarah’,” Jan whispered nastily. “Now everyone has to be nice to her.” 

I felt hurt. I opened my mouth to say something to Jan. 

But I was so happy to be back, so happy to be alive, I just ignored it. 

I rested a hand on Aaron’s shoulder and let him walk me back to my cabin. 
“I’m going to enjoy the rest of camp,” I told my brother. “I really am.” 

The nurse checked me out carefully. Then I rested all afternoon. I took a long 
nap. 

When I woke up, I was starving. I realized I hadn’t eaten all day. 

I pulled on jeans and a camp sweatshirt and hurried to the campfire. As I 
trotted down the path toward the clearing by the woods, the aroma of hot dogs 
and hamburgers on the barbecue drifted out to me. 

Richard greeted me at the campfire circle. “Sarah, you look great!” he 
exclaimed. “I heard about... what happened at the lake this afternoon.” 



“Well, I’m fine now,” I told him. “I feel great.” 

“Hey—no more close calls,” he scolded. “Or else you have to swim in the 
kiddie pool.” 

“I’ll be careful,” I promised. 

“You’d better—because we don’t have a kiddie pool!” he joked. 

I laughed. 

“Take a seat,” he said, pointing to the circle of logs. “Take a seat, 
everyone!” he called out. “We’re going to have a meeting before we eat!” 

Most of the campers had already taken their places. I glanced around the 
circle quickly, searching for a place to sit. 

“Sarah—?” A voice called to me. 

“Sarah—over here.” 

I let out a shocked cry when I saw Della. 

Della. By herself on a log back near the woods. Her blond hair shimmering 
around her pale face. The pink evening sunlight shining through her body. 

Shining right through her. 

“Noooo!” I moaned. 

“Come over here, Sarah!” Della called. “Please—sit over here with me. Be 
my buddy!” 



19 


I raised my hands to my cheeks and let out a shrill scream. 

“No! You’re not here!” I wailed. “You’re a ghost! You don’t belong here! 
I’m alive now! I’m alive!” 

I turned and saw Richard and Liz hurrying toward me. 

Across the circle, Aaron jumped up and came running over. “Sarah—what’s 
wrong? What is it?” he cried. 

“Don’t you see her?” I shrieked. I pointed to the log near the woods. “She’s 
a ghost! But I’m alive!” 

Liz wrapped her arms around me. “It’s okay, Sarah,” she whispered. 
“You’re okay now.” 

“But—but she’s sitting there!” I sputtered. 

Everyone turned to the log. 

“There’s no one there,” Richard said. He narrowed his eyes at me. 

“You had a terrible shock,” Liz said softly. “A terrible shock. You’re still 
not quite yourself, Sarah.” 

“But—but—” I stammered. 

I saw Briana, Meg, and Jan huddled together, talking softly. Watching me. 

What are they saying about me? I wondered. 

“Do you want me to walk you back to your cabin?” Richard asked. 

I shook my head. “No. I’m starving!” 

Liz laughed. “Maybe that’s your problem. You’re so hungry, you’re seeing 
things! Let’s get you a hot dog—fast.” 

After a couple of hot dogs, I started to feel better. The campfire meeting 
began. I sat next to some girls from a different cabin. 

As Richard talked, I gazed around the circle. Stared at the campers’ faces, 
orange from the flickering campfire. Searching for Della. 

Della the ghost... 

Was she still here? Still watching me? Still waiting for me to be her buddy? 

I sat forward tensely. My whole body stiff. My eyes straining to see her 
pale, pale face. 

But she had vanished. 



For now. 

Liz took over the meeting. Most campers groaned when she started another 
lecture on water safety. 

“We had a close call today,” Liz said. “A frightening close call.” 

I knew everyone was staring at me. I could feel my face growing hot. I 
gazed into the yellow flames of the campfire. 

When I raised my eyes, I saw Briana, Meg, and Jan on the next log, 
whispering together. About me? 

“Our water safety rules are so important here at Camp Cold Lake,” Liz was 
saying. “Some campers joke that having so many rules is the curse of Camp 
Cold Lake, because we talk about the rules so much.” 

She pressed her hands against her sides. Her eyes moved from camper to 
camper. “But as we saw this afternoon,” she continued, “the Buddy System isn’t 
a curse—it’s a blessing.” 

A face rose up behind the darting flames of the fire. 

I gasped. 

Della! 

No. A girl from another cabin, climbing up to get more food. 

I sank back. 

I have to get away from this camp, I decided. I can’t have a good time here. 
Not if I always have to keep an eye out for Della. 

Liz rattled on about the water rules. 

Richard made a few announcements. 

Everyone sang some camp songs. 

When the campfire ended, I jumped up quickly and started along the path to 
my cabin. I had gone only a few steps when I heard fast footsteps behind me. 
And heard someone calling my name. 

Was it the ghost? 

I turned to see Aaron jogging up to me. “What was that screaming about?” 
he demanded. “Did you really think you saw a ghost?” 

“Why should I tell you?” I snapped. I continued along the path, walking 
rapidly. “You’ll only laugh at me.” 

“Try me,” he replied, running to catch up. “I won’t laugh. I promise.” 

“I saw a ghost girl,” I told him. “I swear I did. She called to me. She wants 
me to be her buddy.” 

Aaron laughed. “No. Really,” he said. “What did you really see? Be 



serious.” 

“I am serious!” I cried. “I have to get away from here, Aaron. I’m going to 
mn away. Get to a phone. Call Mom and Dad. Tonight. I’m going to tell them to 
come get me.” 

“You can’t!” Aaron replied. He grabbed my arm and forced me to stop 
walking. I could see kids staring at us as they walked past. 

“Mom and Dad won’t want to make more than one trip up here. So if you 
call them, they’ll make me come home too,” Aaron protested. “And I don’t want 
to leave. I’m having a great time!” 

“You don’t understand,” I told him. “I can’t stay here. I can’t—” 

“Please, Sarah,” he begged. “Try to stick it out. Give it a little more time. 
You’re just a little messed up because of the lake this afternoon. But you’ll be 
okay. Give it some time.” 

I didn’t say yes, and I didn’t say no. 

I just told Aaron good-night and headed to my cabin. 

I stopped outside the door. All the lights were on. I heard Briana, Meg, and 
Jan talking softly. 

They stopped talking as soon as I stepped inside. 

All three of them stared hard at me. Their expressions were tense. They 
moved quickly. 

Moved toward me as I started across the room. 

They formed a circle around me. Surrounded me. 

“What is it?” I cried. “What are you going to do?” 



20 


“We want to apologize,” Briana said. 

“We’ve been kind of rough on you,” Jan added in her scratchy voice. 
“We’re really sorry.” 

“We’ve been talking about it,” Briana said. “We—” 

“We decided we’ve been really unfair,” Meg interrupted. “We’re sorry, 
Sarah.” 

“I—I’m sorry too,” I stammered. I was so stunned by their apologies, I 
could barely speak. 

“Let’s start all over,” Briana suggested. She grabbed my hand. “Nice to 
meet you, Sarah. My name is Briana.” 

“Excellent. Afresh start!” Jan declared. 

“Thanks. I’m really glad,” I told them. And I meant it. 

Jan turned to Briana. “When did you do that to your nails?” 

Briana grinned and raised both hands. Her fingernails were a shiny, bright 
purple. “It’s a new color,” she said. “I did it after our swim.” 

“What color is it?” Meg asked. 

“Grape Juice, I think,” Briana replied. “They all have such crazy names.” 
She dug the bottle of nail polish from her pack and held it out to me. “Want to 
try it?” 

“Well... sure,” I replied. 

All four of us stayed up far past Lights Out, making our fingernails purple. 

Later, I lay in my bunk, drifting off to sleep. I had a smile on my face, 
thinking about my three bunk mates. My three friends. 

They had really cheered me up. 

But my smile faded when I heard a whispered voice float across the dark 
cabin. “Sarah... Sarah...” 

I gasped. 

And then the frail voice—soft as the wind—was so close... so close to my 

“Sarah. I thought you were my buddy, Sarah. Why did you leave me?” 

“No—please—” I begged. 


ear. 



“Sarah, I waited so long for you,” the ghostly voice whispered. “Come with 
me. Come with me, Sarah....” 

And then an icy hand gripped my shoulder. 



21 


“Ohhhhh!” 

I bolted up in the bunk. And stared out at Briana’s dark eyes. 

She let go of my shoulder. “Sarah,” she whispered. “You were whimpering 
in your sleep.” 

“Huh? What?” My voice quivered. My heart pounded. I realized I was 
drenched in sweat. 

“You were whimpering in your sleep,” Briana repeated. “Crying and 
moaning. I thought I’d better wake you.” 

“Uh... thanks,” I choked out. “Must have been a bad dream, I guess.” 

Briana nodded and crept back to her bunk. 

I didn’t move. I sat there trembling, staring out across the dark cabin. 

A bad dream? 

I didn’t think so.... 

“You can skip the long-distance swim today if you want,” Liz told me at 
breakfast the next morning. She leaned over my chair as I downed my 
cornflakes. I could smell the toothpaste on her breath. 

“Well...” I hesitated. “How long is the swim?” 

“We’re swimming halfway across the lake,” Liz replied. “Halfway out, then 
back. I’ll be in a boat at the halfway point. It isn’t really that far. But if you feel 
like skipping it today...” 

I set down my spoon. I could see Meg and Briana watching me from across 
the table. Beside me, Jan was struggling to choke down a half-toasted, frozen 
waffle. 

“Come on. Swim with us,” Briana urged. 

“I’ll be your buddy,” Jan said. “I’ll swim with you, Sarah.” 

Our frightening canoe adventure flashed into my mind. Once again, I 
pictured that horrible moment when Jan jumped from the canoe. Tipping it over. 
Leaving me there. 

But things were different now. 

We were friends. All four of us were friends now. I had to forget about what 
happened with the canoe. I had to forget about our bad start. 



“Okay,” I agreed. “Thanks, Jan. I’ll be your buddy.” I turned back to Liz. 
“I’m ready to swim.” 

The morning sun still floated low in the sky. It kept fading behind broad, gray 
clouds. And each time the sun disappeared, the air became as cold as the water. 

The lake was so cold in the early morning! 

As I waded in, I suddenly realized why it was named “Cold Lake”. 

We all stepped carefully into the water, shivering and complaining. The 
water lapped over my ankles, stinging them. I stopped with a gasp and waited to 
get used to the cold. 

I raised my eyes at the sound of a motorboat and saw Liz chugging to her 
place in the middle of the lake. When she reached the spot, she cut the engine. 
Then she picked up an electric megaphone. 

“Warm up first, everyone!” she instructed us. 

We all laughed. “Warm up? How are we supposed to warm up? It’s 
freezing!” 

Two girls near the shore began splashing each other. 

“Stop it! Whoooa! It’s collldV’ one of them shrieked. 

Taking another few steps over the soft lake bottom, I adjusted the top of my 
blue swimsuit. “We need wet suits,” I told Jan. 

She nodded, then waded out until the water lapped at her waist. “Come on, 
Sarah. Stick together.” She motioned for me to follow. 

I took a deep breath—and plunged into the water. 

A shock of cold swept over my body. But I dove under the water and swam 
out a few strokes. Then I raised my head and turned back to Jan. 

“Show off,” she muttered. She dipped her hands in the water, still 
struggling to get used to the cold. 

I laughed. “It’s refreshing!” I exclaimed, brushing my wet hair back. “Come 
on—just push off. It isn’t that bad.” 

Jan lowered herself into the water. Most of the swimmers were in the water 
now, moving in circles, floating on their backs, treading water. 

“Line up, everyone!” Liz instructed from her boat. Her voice through the 
megaphone echoed off the trees behind us. “Line up. Two at a time. Let’s go!” 

It took a while for everyone to get in place. Jan and I were second in line. 

I watched the first two girls begin to swim. One of them moved with 
smooth, steady strokes. The other one splashed and thrashed. 



Everyone cheered them on. 

Jan and I gave them about a two-minute head start. Then we began to swim. 

I tried to copy the first girl’s rhythmic stroke. I didn’t want to look like a 
klutz. I knew all the other swimmers were watching. But let’s get real. I’m not 
exactly headed for the Olympics. 

Jan pulled ahead easily. As we swam, she kept turning back to make sure I 
was keeping up with her. 

The turnaround spot was just past Liz’s motor-boat. I kept my eyes on it as I 
followed Jan through the water. It seemed very far away! 

Jan picked up speed. My arms started aching about halfway to the boat. 

I’m in bad shape, I told myself. I’ve really got to start working out or 
something. 

Liz’s boat bobbed gently up ahead of us. Liz was shouting something into 
the megaphone. But the splash of the water kept me from making out the words. 

Up ahead of me, Jan picked up the pace. 

“Hey—slow down!” I called. But there was no way she could hear me. 

Ignoring the aching in my arms, I struggled to catch up to her. I kicked my 
legs harder, splashing up water behind me. 

The sun dipped once again behind a high cloud. The sky darkened, and the 
water seemed to chill. 

Liz’s boat rocked in the water, just up ahead. I kept my eyes on Jan. 
Watched her steady kicks. Her hair bobbing on the lake surface like some kind of 
sea creature. 

When Jan turns back, I’ll turn back, I decided. 

I swam a little faster. Let’s turn, I pleaded silently. Jan, we’re here. We’re 
even with Liz’s motorboat. I’m ready to turn back now. 

But to my surprise, Jan kept stroking, kept swimming straight ahead. Her 
head ducked under the water. Her arms moved easily, gracefully, pulling her 
farther ahead of me. 

“Jan—?” 

My arms ached. My chest started to burn. 

“Hey, Jan—can we turn now?” 

She swam steadily ahead. 

With a burst of energy, I pulled myself forward. “Jan, wait—” I called. 
“We’re supposed to head back!” 

She stopped stroking. 



Did she hear me? 

Breathing hard, my chest burning, I swam up to her. 

She turned to face me. 

“Jan—■?” I gasped. 

No. Not Jan. 

It wasn’t Jan. It was Della! 

Her blue eyes sparkled as a gleeful smile spread over her pale, pale face. 
“Keep swimming, Sarah,” she whispered. “We’re going to swim farther. 
And farther. You’re my buddy now.” 



22 


She grabbed my arm. 

I tried to tug away. My wet arm slid in her grasp. 

But her grip tightened around my wrist. And she held on. Pulling me. 
Pulling me with her. 

“Owww!” 

She was strong. So strong for such a frail-looking girl. 

Such a frail-looking ghost ... 

“Let go!” I shrieked. 

I struggled, slapping the water. Kicking. Squirming and twisting. 

“Della—I won’t come with you!” 

I jerked my body around, spun hard—and broke free. 

And dropped beneath the surface. Lifting both arms, I rose up, coughing 
and sputtering. 

Where was she? 

Where? 

Was she right behind me? Ready to pull me with her, pull me out so far I 
couldn’t swim back? 

I spun away. The water rocked and tilted. 

The clouds overhead appeared to roar past. 

“Sarah... Sarah...?” Was she calling to me? 

Why couldn’t I see her now? 

I turned again. My eyes stopped on the boat. 

Yes. The boat. 

Ignoring my racing heartbeats, my aching arms, I plunged forward. 

The boat... got to reach the boat before she grabs me again. 

Swimming furiously, kicking with my last bit of strength, I dove for the 
boat. Stretching my arms out... stretching... 

And grabbed the side with both hands. Choking and gasping. 

Grabbed the side of the boat and tried to pull myself in. 

“Liz—help me.” The words escaped my throat in a hoarse whisper. 

“Liz—help me in.” 



The sun burst out from behind the clouds. I stared up into blinding golden 

light. 

“Liz—please...” 

Hands reached down for me. She bent to pull me into the motorboat. 

Leaned forward. Pulling me up. 

Blinking against the bright sunlight, I raised my eyes to her face. 

No! 

Not Liz’s face. Not Liz! 

Della! 

Della—pulling me into the boat. “What’s wrong, Sarah?” she whispered. 
Pulling me. Pulling me up to her. “Sarah, you’re okay. You’re perfectly okay.” 



23 


“Let go!” I wailed. 

I tore myself from her grip. 

And tried to blink away the sun. 

And stared up at Liz. 

Not Della. Liz. Her face twisted in concern. 

“Sarah, you’re okay,” she repeated. 

“But—” I stared up at her. Waiting for her face to change again. Waiting for 
her to become Della again. 

Had I only imagined Della’s face? Had the streaming sunlight tricked my 
eyes? 

With a sigh, I let her help me into the boat. 

I slumped to my knees. The boat rocked up and down. Liz narrowed her 
eyes at me. “What happened out there?” she asked. 

Before I could answer, I heard splashing outside the boat. 

Della? 

I froze. 

No. Jan pulled herself up on the side. She brushed her wet hair off her face. 
“Sarah—didn’t you hear me calling you?” she demanded. 

“Jan. I didn’t see you. I thought that—” My voice caught in my throat. 

“Why did you swim away from me?” Jan asked. “I’m your buddy— 
remember?” 

Liz drove me to shore. I changed my clothes and went to see Richard. I found 
him in his head counselor’s office, a little room about the size of a closet in the 
back of the main lodge. 

He was resting his feet on top of his tiny desk. He twirled a toothpick in his 
mouth. 

“Hey, Sarah—how’s it going?” He flashed me a friendly smile and 
motioned for me to take a seat in the folding chair across from his desk. 

I could see his eyes studying me. 

“I hear you had another little problem in the lake,” he said softly. He moved 



the toothpick to the other side of his mouth. “What’s going on?” 

I took a deep breath. 

Should I tell him there is a ghost girl who has been following me 
everywhere? Who wants me to be her buddy? 

He’d just think I’m nuts, I decided. 

“You had a bad shock yesterday,” Richard said. “We really thought that you 
drowned.” 

He lowered his feet and leaned over the desk toward me. “Maybe you went 
back in the water too soon,” he said. “Too soon after the shock.” 

“Maybe,” I murmured. 

And then I blurted out the question that was really on my mind. “Richard, 
tell me about the girl who drowned here.” 

His mouth dropped open. “Huh?” The toothpick fell onto his lap. 

“I know that a girl drowned in the lake,” I insisted. “Can you tell me about 
her?” 

Richard shook his head. “No girl ever drowned at Camp Cold Lake,” he 
said. “Never.” 

I knew he was lying. 

I had proof, after all. I had seen Della. And talked with her. 

“Richard, please—” I begged. “I really need to know. Tell me about her.” 

He frowned. “Why don’t you believe me, Sarah? I’m telling the truth. No 
campers have ever drowned at this camp. No boys. No girls.” 

I heard a soft sigh behind me. 

I glanced back at the open doorway—and saw Della standing there. 

I jumped to my feet. And pointed. “Richard!” I cried. “The girl who 
drowned! She’s standing right there! Don’t you see her?” 

Richard raised his eyes to the doorway. “Yes,” he replied softly. “I see her.” 



24 


“Huh?” I gasped and grabbed the edge of his desk. “You see her?” I cried. “You 
really do?” 

Richard nodded. He had a solemn expression on his face. “If it makes you 
feel better, Sarah, I’ll say that I see her.” 

“But you don’t really see her?” I demanded. 

He scratched his sandy-colored hair. “No. I don’t see anything.” 

I turned back to the doorway. Della grinned at me. 

“Sit down. Please,” Richard instructed. “You know, sometimes our mind 
plays tricks on us. Especially when we’ve been through a really bad scare.” 

I didn’t sit down. I stood in front of his desk and stared hard at Della. Stared 
right through her. 

“She’s not in my mind! She’s right there!” I shouted. “She’s standing right 
there, Richard. Her name is Della. She drowned at this camp. And now she’s 
trying to drown me too!” 

“Sarah—please calm down,” Richard said gently. He climbed around his 
desk and put a hand on my shoulder. Then he led me to the door. 

I was standing face-to-face with Della. 

She stuck out her tongue at me. 

“See? There’s no one there,” Richard said. 

“But—but—” I sputtered. 

“Why don’t you stay away from the lake for a few days,” he suggested. 
“You know. Just hang out and relax.” 

Della mouthed his words as he spoke. 

I turned away from her. 

She giggled. 

“Don’t go to the lake?” I asked Richard. 

He nodded. “Take a few days and rest up. You’ll feel much better.” 

I knew I wouldn’t feel better. I knew I’d still have Della following me 
everywhere, trying to make me her buddy. 

I sighed. “That won’t help,” I told him. 

“Then I have a different idea,” he said. “Pick a sport you haven’t tried, 



Sarah. Pick something really hard. Like water-skiing.” 

“I don’t get it,” I replied. “Why should I do that?” 

“Because you will have to think so hard about what you’re doing, you 
won’t have time to worry about ghosts.” 

I rolled my eyes. “Yeah. Right.” 

“I’m trying to help you,” he said sharply. 

“Well... thanks,” I replied. I didn’t know what else to say. “I guess I’ll go to 
lunch now.” 

I trudged out of the tiny office. And took a deep breath. The air was much 
cooler out in the main lodge. 

I turned the corner and headed toward the mess hall in the front of the 
building. As I turned another corner, I heard Della’s frail voice behind me. 

“You can’t get away, Sarah. You’re my buddy. There’s no need to run. 
You’ll always be my buddy.” 

The soft words—so close to my ear—sent shivers down my back. 

Something inside me snapped. 

I couldn’t hold in my fury. 

“SHUT UP!” I shrieked. “SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP—AND 
LEAVE ME ALONE!” 

I spun around to see if she had heard me. 

And gasped in horror. 



25 


Briana stood behind me. 

Her mouth dropped open in shock. “Okay, okay. I’ll go away,” she said, 
backing up. “You don’t have to be so nasty, Sarah. I was just coming to see how 
you were doing.” 

Wow. I felt so bad. 

Briana thought I was talking to her. 

“I—I—” I stammered. 

“I thought you wanted to be friends,” Briana snapped. “I didn’t even say a 
word to you. And you bit my head off!” 

“I wasn’t talking to you!” I finally choked out. “I was talking to her!” 

I pointed to Della, who leaned against the wall behind us. Della waved to 
me and giggled. 

Sun from the open lodge window lit up Della’s blond hair from behind. I 
could see the window right through her body. 

“I was talking to her!” I repeated. 

Briana raised her eyes to the window. 

And the strangest expression spread over her face. 

The next morning, I gulped down some gooey scrambled eggs for breakfast. 
Then I made my way to the boat dock. 

Don’t ask why I decided to try water-skiing. 

I really don’t have an answer. 

I suppose I did it for Aaron. The night before, he begged me once again not 
to call Mom and Dad. 

Aaron really didn’t want to go home. He said he was having the best 
summer of his life. 

Sure, I thought. It’s easy for you to have a good summer. You don’t have a 
ghost following you around. 

“Please try to stay a while longer,” Aaron begged. 

I won’t go to the lake, I decided. I’ll hang around the cabin and read or 
something. 



But in the morning, I realized that was a bad plan. 

I’d be too scared to stay by myself in the cabin while everyone else was at 
the lake. I would have no way to protect myself against Della. 

Yes, I know I wasn’t thinking clearly. 

I was so stressed out, I could barely think at all! 

I should have stayed as far away from the water as possible. 

But I really didn’t want to be alone. So I followed Richard’s advice. And 
went to the boat dock. And told Liz I wanted to try water-skiing. 

“That’s great, Sarah!” Liz cried, flashing me a pleased smile. “Have you 
ever done it before? It’s easier than it looks.” 

I told her I’d never tried it. 

She pulled a yellow inflated life vest and a pair of skis from the equipment 

shed. 

Then she gave me a short lesson. Showed me how to lean back and how to 
bend my knees. 

A short while later, I was in the water waiting for the motorboat to come 
around. Meg was using the boat now, skiing behind it, sliding over the water. 
Her orange bathing suit glowed in the morning sunlight. 

The hum of the boat echoed over the water. The lake bobbed and rippled in 
the boat’s wake. 

Meg let out a cry and let go of the towrope as the boat sped near the dock. 
She splashed into the water, then quickly pulled off her skis. Then she came 
walking to shore. 

“My turn next,” I said softly. I felt a knot in my stomach. 

Meg flashed me a thumbs-up. 

I struggled with the skis, but finally got them in place. Then I pulled up the 
towrope, gripping it tightly in both hands. 

The boat motor sputtered and coughed. The boat rocked up ahead of me in 
the rippling blue water. 

I steadied myself. Lowered myself the way Liz had shown me. And took a 
deep breath. 

“Ready!” I called. 

The motor sputtered—and then roared. 

The boat pulled away so fast, the towrope nearly flew out of my hands. 

“Whooooooooaaa!” I opened my mouth in a long cry as the rope pulled me 


up. 



Yes! The skis bounced over the surface. I bent my knees and gripped the 
towrope tightly. 

I’m doing it! I realized. I’m water-skiing! 

The boat picked up speed. We headed in a straight line over the sparkling 
water. The cold spray swept over my face, my hair. 

I started to lose my balance. Tugged myself back up. Held on—and kept 
going. 

“Yessss!” I cried out loud. What an awesome feeling! 

But then the driver of the boat turned her head. 

And I recognized Della’s evil grin. 

As she worked the controls, Della’s white-blond hair flew up like wings 
around her pale face. Her blue eyes sparkled like the water. 

Her grin grew wider as she saw the horror on my face. 

“Turn around! Turn back! Please!” I begged. 

She made the boat swerve hard. 

I nearly toppled over. I gripped the towrope. 

My skis slapped the surface. Pain shot up to my knees. The cold spray 
washed over me. 

I gasped. Struggled to breathe. 

Della threw back her head and laughed. The sound was drowned out by the 
roar of the motor. 

I could see the sky through her body. The sunlight poured right through her. 

“Turn around!” I screamed. “Stop! Where are you taking me? Where?” 



26 


Della didn’t answer. She turned away from me, her hair flying wildly behind her 
head. 

The boat bounced over the water, sending up tall waves of foam and spray. 

The waves splashed over me. Chilling me. Blinding me. 

Gripped in panic, it took me a long time to realize that I had an easy escape. 

I let go of the towrope. 

My hands shot up. The tow bar snapped against the water. 

I skidded for a few seconds, my arms thrashing wildly. And then I toppled 
over and sank. 

The life vest pulled me back up. I bounced on the surface, gasping, spitting 
out water. My heart pounded. 

I felt so dizzy. The bright sunlight seemed to surround me. Which way was 
up? Which way to the shore? 

I spun around and saw the motorboat in the distance. 

“You didn’t get me this time!” I called to Della. 

But then I froze as the boat began to turn. Della swerved the boat, kicking 
up a tall wave of white water. 

Swerved it back around. Until it pointed to me. 

I gasped as I heard the motor roar. 

I bobbed helplessly in the water. 

The boat picked up speed, skipping over the rippling surface. 

She’s coming for me, I thought. She’s coming to make me her buddy 
forever. 

I’m trapped out here. 

She’s coming to run me over. 



27 


I treaded water, watching in horror as the boat sped toward me. 

I’ve got to dive under it, I realized. The only way to escape is down. 

I took a deep breath. Every muscle tensed. I knew I had to time my dive 
perfectly. 

The boat roared closer. I could see Della crouched over the motor. Guiding 
the boat. 

Aiming it. 

I took another deep breath. And then I realized I couldn’t dive. 

The life vest—it was holding me up. No way I could plunge beneath the 
surface. 

With a cry, I grabbed the front of the vest with both hands. 

And tugged. 

I can’t do this! I realized. I can’t get this thing off in time! 

The water rocked harder as the boat sped nearer. The whole lake seemed to 
tilt and spin. 

The boat—it’s going to tear me to pieces! I thought. 

I pulled at the vest. Pushed it. 

Please — please—slide over my head! 

No time. No time. 

I can’t dive! 

The motor’s roar drowned out my scream. 

With a frantic tug, I pulled the life vest up. Over my shoulders. 

Too late. 

The front of the boat bounced over me. 

Then the whirring motor blades sliced off my head. 



28 


I waited for the pain. 

I waited for the darkness. 

The water swirled around me. Blue, then green. 

Choking on a mouthful of water, I thrashed up to the surface. Struggling to 
breathe, I let the waves rock me back and forth. 

“The life vest!” I choked out. 

I held half of the vest in each hand. 

The motor blades had sliced the life vest in two. 

I tossed the two pieces away. And started to laugh. 

“I’m alive!” I cried out loud. “I’m still alive!” 

I turned and saw the boat speeding across the lake. Did Della think she had 
won? 

I didn’t care. I spun around. Found the shore. And started to swim. 

My close call gave me new energy. The strong, rocking current helped push 
me back to the camp. 

I heard girls calling to me as I stumbled onto the grass. And I saw Liz 
jogging quickly over. 

“Sarah—” she called. “Sarah—wait!” 

I ignored her. I ignored them all. 

I started to run. 

I knew what I had to do. I had to get away from Camp Cold Lake. I had to 
get away as fast as I could. 

I wasn’t safe here. Not as long as Della wanted me for her buddy. Not as 
long as Della wanted me to drown too. 

I knew no one would believe me. They all said they wanted to help. But no 
one could really help me—not against a ghost! 

I burst into the cabin and tore off my wet swimsuit. Tossing it to the floor, I 
frantically pulled on shorts and a T-shirt. 

I swept my wet hair back with both hands. Tugged on socks and my 
sneakers. 

“Got to get away. Got to get away,” I chanted to myself. 



What to do? Where to go? 

I’ll run through the woods to the town on the other side, I decided. I’ll call 
Mom and Dad. I’ll tell them I’m hiding in town. I’ll tell them to pick me up 
there. 

I stopped at the cabin doorway. 

Should I tell Aaron? 

No. No way, I decided. 

He’ll only try to stop me. 

I’ll get a message to Aaron from town, I decided. I’ll tell him where I am. 
But not until I’m safe. Not until I’m far away from this place. 

I poked my head out of the cabin and searched around, making sure the 
coast was clear. Then I stepped outside and made my way around to the back. 
And ran into Briana. 

She narrowed her eyes at me, studying my face. “You’re going?” she asked 
quietly. 

I nodded. “Yes. I’m going.” 

Once again, Briana’s expression changed. The light in her eyes seemed to 

fade. 


“Good luck,” she whispered. 



29 


Why is she acting so weird? I wondered. 

I didn’t have time to think about it. I gave Briana a wave. Then I ran past 
her and headed into the woods. 

I glanced back as I followed a path between the trees. And saw Briana still 
standing there behind the cabin. Watching me. 

Taking a deep breath, I turned and hurried along the path. 

The trees overhead cut off a lot of the sunlight. It grew darker and cooler as 
I ran. 

A hedge of sharp burrs and brambles scraped my bare arms and legs as I 
tried to edge past. I wished I had worn jeans and a sweatshirt. Something that 
covered me better. 

My sneakers slipped over a thick blanket of dead leaves. I had to skip over 
fallen tree limbs and clumps of thorny weeds. 

Tree roots rose up over the path. Tall, dry reeds leaned over me, as if 
reaching to grab me. 

The narrow path divided in two. I paused—breathing hard—trying to 
decide which path to take. 

Would they both lead me to town? 

I held my breath when I heard a voice. Singing. 

A bird? 

No. A soft voice. A girl’s voice. 

“Oh, no,” I moaned. Raising my eyes to the sound, I saw Della, perched on 
a low tree limb. She tilted her head from side to side as she sang. Her blue eyes 
sparkled, gazing down at me. 

“You—you followed me!” I stammered. “How did you know that I—” My 
voice caught in my throat. 

She giggled. “You’re my buddy,” she replied. “We have to stick together.” 

“No! No way!” I screamed up at her. “You lose, Della. I’m not going to be 
your buddy. Because I’m never going to the lake again. I’m never going to 
drown like you!” 

Della’s smile faded. “Drown?” She shook her head. “Sarah, what made you 
think that? You’re very confused. I didn’t drown.” 



“Huh?” My mouth dropped open. I stared up at her in shock. 

“Close your mouth, Sarah. A fly will fly into it.” Della tilted back her head 
and laughed. 

Then she shook her head again. “How could anyone drown at Camp Cold 
Lake?” she demanded. “They give a lecture about water safety every five 
minutes! No one ever drowned at Camp Cold Lake!” 

“You didn’t drown?” I cried. “Then how did you die?” 

She rested her hands on the tree limb and leaned forward, peering down at 
me. I could see through her body, see the leaves shaking in the breeze. 

“It’s a simple story,” Della said with a sigh. “One night I got tired of 
listening to the water safety lecture at the campfire. So I sneaked off into these 
woods.” 

She swept her hair back with a toss of her head. “I made one major 
mistake,” she continued. “I didn’t know the woods are filled with deadly 
poisonous snakes.” 

I gasped. “These woods? Snakes?” 

Della nodded. “It’s nearly impossible to cross through these woods without 
getting bitten,” she sighed. “I died of a snakebite, Sarah.” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. “But you were always at the lake,” I choked out. 
“Why did I always see you at the lake?” 

“Don’t you get it?” she replied. “That was my plan. I made you afraid of the 
lake, Sarah. I made you terrified of the lake. Because I knew you’d try to escape 
through the woods. I knew you’d run into the woods and die like me—and be 
my buddy.” 

“No—!” I protested. “I won’t. I—” 

“Sarah, look!” Della pointed toward the ground. 

I gazed down—and watched a fat black snake curl around my leg. 



30 


“Buddies forever,” Della sang cheerfully. “Buddies forever.” 

I stood frozen, gaping down in horror. Watching the fat snake wind itself 
around me. Feeling its warm, dry body scrape over my bare skin. 

“Nooooo.” A low moan escaped my throat as the snake arched its head. 

“It won’t hurt that much,” Della said brightly. “It’s like a bee sting, Sarah. 
That’s all.” 

The snake let out a loud hiss. It snapped open its jaws. 

I felt its body tighten like a warm rope around my leg. 

“Buddies forever,” Della sang. “Buddies forever...” 

“No! Sarah is not your buddy!” a voice rang out. 

I tried to turn toward the voice. But I couldn’t move. I felt the snake tighten 
its hold on my leg. 

“Briana!” I cried. “What are you doing here?” 

She hurried out from behind a clump of tall reeds. 

With one quick motion, she grabbed the snake in one hand. Slid it off my 
leg. And tossed it into the trees. 

Briana raised her eyes to Della. “Sarah can’t be your buddy, because she’s 
my buddy!” Briana shouted. 

Della’s eyes grew wide. She cried out in surprise. She gripped the tree 
branch to keep from falling. 

“You!” she exclaimed. “What are you doing here?” 

“Yes, it’s me!” Briana shouted up to her. “I’m back, Della.” 

“But—but how did you...” Della’s voice trailed off. 

“You tried to do the same thing to me last year,” Briana said. “You tried all 
summer to make me your buddy. You terrified me—didn’t you, Della?” 

Briana uttered an angry cry. “You didn’t think I’d come back. But I did. I 
came back to camp this summer... to protect the next girl!” 

“Nooo!” Della wailed. 

I finally understood. I stepped up to the tree beside Briana. “Briana is my 
buddy!” I declared. “And I’m coming back next summer to warn the next girl!” 

“No! No! Nooooo!” Della raged. “You can’t do that! I’ve waited so long! 



So lonnnng!” 

She let go of the tree limb and shook her fists at Briana and me. 

Lost her balance. 

Her hands flew up as she started to fall. 

She grabbed for the limb. Missed. 

And dropped silently to the ground. 

Then she was gone. 

Vanished. 

With a weary sigh, I climbed to my feet. I shook my head. “Is she gone for 
good?” I murmured. 

Briana shrugged. “I don’t know. I hope so.” 

I turned to Briana. “You—you saved my life!” I cried. “Thank you for 
following me. Thank you for saving me!” 

With a happy cry, I stepped up to her. “Thank you! Thank you!” 

I wrapped my arms around her to hug her. 

And my hands went right through her body. 

I gasped. I grabbed her shoulder. But I couldn’t feel a thing. 

I jumped back in shock. 

Briana narrowed her eyes at me. “Della killed me last summer, Sarah,” she 
said softly. “On the last day. But I didn’t want to be her buddy. I just never liked 
her.” 

She floated forward, raised herself off the ground, hovered over me. 

“But I need a buddy,” she whispered. “Everyone has to have a buddy. 
You’ll be my buddy—won’t you, Sarah?” 

I saw the hissing snake in her hand. 

But I couldn’t move. 

“You’ll be my buddy—won’t you?” Briana repeated. “You’ll be my buddy 
forever.” 



MY BEST FRIEND 
IS INVISIBLE 

Goosebumps - 57 
R.L. Stine 



1 


I sat at the dinner table and wished I was invisible. 

If I were invisible, I could sneak away from dinner without finishing my 
string beans. And I could creep up to my room and finish the book of ghost 
stories I’d been reading. 

I started to daydream. I’m Sammy Jacobs, the Invisible Boy, I told myself. I 
tried to picture how I’d look if I were invisible. 

Last week, I saw a movie about an invisible man. You couldn’t see his face 
or his body. But when he ate, you could see the food digesting in his invisible 
stomach. 

It was totally gross. 

I loved it. 

Staring at my string beans, I pictured them rolling around in my stomach. 

My parents’ voices droned on in the background. My parents are research 
scientists. They work in a college lab. They do weird things with light and lasers. 

And then they come home and talk about their work at dinner. And talk 
about their work. And talk about their work. 

My ten-year-old brother, Simon, and I can’t get a word in. 

We have to sit and listen to them talk about “light refraction” and “ocular 
impediments”. 

I’m a science-fiction freak. I love reading science-fiction books and comics. 
And I rent any movie that has an alien from another planet in it. 

But when I have to listen to my parents talk about their work, I feel like an 
alien from another planet. I mean, I can’t understand a single word they say! 

“Hey, Mom and Dad.” I tried to get into the conversation. “Guess what? I 
grew a tail today.” 

Mom and Dad didn’t hear me. They were too busy arguing about something 
called “morphology”. 

“Actually, I grew two tails,” I said, louder. 

They didn’t care. Dad was drawing some kind of chart on his napkin. 

I was really bored. I kicked Simon under the table. Just for something to do. 

“Ow! Stop it, Sammy!” he cried. He kicked me back. 



I kicked him again. 

Dad kept scribbling numbers all over his napkin. Mom squinted at his chart. 

Simon kicked me back. Too hard. 

“Whoa!” I screamed. My hands flew up—and sent my dinner plate flying. 

SPLAAT. 

Into my lap. 

A whole plateful of spaghetti and all the string beans—slid down my jeans. 

“Look what Simon made me do!” I shouted. 

“You started it!” Simon protested. 

Mom glanced up from the chart. At least I had her attention. And maybe I’d 
even get Simon into trouble. Simon never gets yelled at. He’s good. 

Mom’s gaze shifted from me to Simon. “Simon,” Mom started. 

All right! I thought. Simon is in for it now! 

“Help your clumsy brother clean up,” Mom said. She glanced down at the 
floor and pointed to the pile of spaghetti. “And make sure you mop up this 
mess.” Then she grabbed Dad’s pencil and scribbled a bunch of numbers next to 
his. 

Simon tried to help me clean up. But I pushed him away and did it myself. 

Was I steamed? Take a guess. 

Okay. Okay. Maybe the spaghetti wasn’t Simon’s fault. But nothing is ever 
Simon’s fault. Ever. 

Why? 

I told you—Simon is the good one. He never waits until the last minute to 
do his homework. He never has to be reminded to throw his clothes in the 
hamper. Or take out the garbage. Or wipe his feet when he comes in the house. 

What kind of kid is that? 

A mutant —if you ask me. 

“Simon is a mutant,” I mumbled as I used my napkin to wipe my dinner 
from my lap. 

“My Brother—the Mutant.” I smiled. I liked the sound of that. It would 
make a good science-fiction movie, I decided. 

I tossed the paper napkin into the trash and returned to the table. 

Well, at least I won’t have to eat any more string beans, I thought, staring 
down at my empty plate. 

Wrong. 

“Sammy, give me your dish. I’ll refill it.” Mom stood up, took my plate— 



and slipped on the spaghetti on the floor. 

Uh-oh. 

I watched as she lost her balance and slid across the kitchen. I laughed. I 
couldn’t help it. I mean, she looked pretty funny—sliding across the floor like 
that. 

“Who laughed?” Mom turned to face us. “Was it you, Simon?” 

“Of course not,” Simon answered. 

Of course not. Simon’s favorite words. 

Simon—do you want to watch TV? Of course not. Want to play ball? Of 
course not. Want to hear a joke? Of course not. 

Simon would never laugh at Mom. 

Simon did only serious things. 

Simon—the Serious Mutant. 

Mom turned to me and let out a long sigh. She returned to the table with my 
plate. Refilled. With lots more string beans. Great. 

Disappear. Disappear. I stared at my string beans and chanted silently. Last 
week I read a story about a kid who could make things disappear just by 
concentrating hard. 

It wasn’t working for me. 

“I can’t wait for Saturday to come,” I said, burying the string beans under 
the spaghetti. 

“Why?” Simon was the only one who asked. 

“I’m going to see School Spirit,” I told him. 

“School spirit?” Dad glanced up from his napkin chart, his eyes finally 
wide with interest. “School spirit is great! Who has school spirit?” 

“Nobody, Dad. School Spirit is the name of a new movie. It’s about a ghost 
that haunts an old boarding school,” I explained. “I’m going to see it on 
Saturday.” 

Dad placed his pencil down. “I wish you were more interested in real 
science, Sammy. I think real science is even stranger than the fantasy stuff you 
like.” 

“But ghosts are real, Dad!” 

“Your dad and I are scientists, Sammy,” Mom said. “We don’t believe in 
things like ghosts.” 

“Well, you’re wrong,” I declared. “If ghosts don’t exist, why have there 
been stories about them for hundreds of years? 



“Besides, this movie isn’t fantasy stuff,” I told them. “It’s a true story. Real 
kids were interviewed for it. Kids who swear they saw the ghost in school!” 

Mom shook her head. 

Dad chuckled. “What are you doing in school, Simon? Seen any ghosts 
lately?” 

“Of course not,” Simon replied. “I’m starting my science project this week. 
It’s called: How Fast Do We Grow? I’m going to study myself for six months. 
And make a growth graph for every part of my body.” 

“That’s wonderful!” Mom said. 

“Very original!” Dad exclaimed. “Let us know if we can help.” 

“Oh, brother,” I mumbled, rolling my eyes. “Can I be excused?” I pushed 
my chair away from the table. “Roxanne is coming over to do math homework.” 

Roxanne Johnson and I are both in the same seventh-grade class. We like to 
compete against each other. Just for fun. 

At least, I think it’s for fun. Sometimes I’m not sure what Roxanne thinks. 

Anyway, she’s one of my best friends. She likes science fiction too. We 
planned to see School Spirit together. 

I went upstairs to search for my math book. 

I opened the door to my room. 

I stepped inside—and gasped.

My homework papers lay scattered all over the floor. 

I’m not exactly the neatest kid in the world—but I do not throw my 
homework on the floor. 

Not usually, anyway. 

Well, at least not today. 

Brutus—my orange cat—sat in the middle of the mess, with his head buried 
underneath the pile of papers. 

“Brutus—did you do this?” I demanded. Brutus jerked his head up. He 
glanced at me—then darted under my bed to hide. 

Hmmm. That’s weird, I thought. Brutus actually looks scared. That is 
definitely weird. 

Brutus never hides from anything. In fact, he’s the meanest cat in the 
neighborhood. Every kid on the block has been scratched by Brutus—at least 
once. 

I looked at the window. It was open. The light-blue curtains billowed in the 
breeze. 

I gathered my papers from the floor. The wind probably blew them off my 
desk, I guessed. 

Wait a minute. Something was wrong. 

I stared at the window. 

I could swear I left that window closed. 

But I couldn’t have. I mean, there it was—wide-open. 

“What are you looking at?” Roxanne stepped into my room. 

“Something weird is going on here,” I told her, shutting the window. “I 
closed this before dinner. Now it’s open.” 

“Your mom must have opened it,” she said. “What’s the big deal, anyway? 
It’s just the window.” 

“It’s no big deal,” I said. “But my mom didn’t open it. Neither did Dad or 
Simon. We were all downstairs.” 

I shook my head. “I know I closed it. Brutus was the only one up here—and 
he didn’t open it.” 

I peered under the bed. There was Brutus—snuggled against my sneakers. 



Shaking. 

“Come on, Brutus. Come out,” I urged softly. “Don’t be afraid. I know she’s 
scary—but it’s only Roxanne.” 

“Very funny, Sammy.” Roxanne rolled her eyes. “I’ll tell you what’s scary. 
Your brother is scary.” 

“What do you mean?” I asked. 

“I passed him on the way up here. Do you know what he was doing?” she 
asked. 

“No,” I said. 

“He was lying on the living room floor. On a huge piece of cardboard. 
Tracing himself,” Roxanne replied. 

I shrugged. “He must be working on his science project. He’s studying 
himself.” 

“Your brother is definitely scary,” she said. “I’ll tell you something else 
that’s scary—the way you ran today. That was very, very scary. I didn’t think 
anyone could run that slow!” 

Roxanne beat me in the track race at school today. And she wasn’t going to 
let me forget it. 

“You won because of only ONE reason,” I told her. 

“And what was that ONE reason?” she mimicked me. 

I slid halfway under the bed and dragged Brutus out. Stalling for time. 
Stalling so I could come up with a good reason. 

“You won because—I let you!” I said finally. 

“Yeah, right, Sammy.” Roxanne folded her arms across her chest. 

“I did. I let you,” I insisted. 

Roxanne’s cheeks turned red. I could see she was getting really steamed. 

Making Roxanne angry is fun. 

“I let you win—because I wanted to help build up your confidence for the 
school Olympics,” I said. 

Whoa! That made Roxanne even angrier. Roxanne doesn’t like help from 
anyone. And she likes to think she’s the best at everything. 

Our school is going to compete against other schools in a mini-Olympics 
next week. Roxanne and I are both on the Olympic team. We were both on the 
team last year too. Roxanne ran every single day to make sure she was the best. 

But last year, we lost. 

I guess it was my fault. A camera flashed in my face. I tripped—and fell. 



“You lost fair and square today, Sammy—and you know it,” Roxanne 
snapped. “And you’d better not trip next week. And make us lose the Olympics 
again.” 

“Last year wasn’t my fault!” I cried. But Roxanne interrupted me. 

“Hey—what’s wrong with Brutus?” she asked, peering over my shoulder. 

I turned around and saw Brutus sitting in the corner—curled up in a tight 

ball. 

“I don’t know. He’s acting kind of strange today,” I said. 

“I know,” she agreed. “He didn’t even try to scratch me yet. He’s been 
acting— nice.” 

Brutus stood. He glanced at the window—and arched his back. 

Then he turned completely around and sat down, facing the wall. 

Weird. 

“So? What are we going to do for our term project?” Roxanne asked, 
plopping down on my bed. 

Our term project for our English class was due next month. Ms. Starkling, 
our teacher, wanted us to work in pairs. She said working in pairs would help us 
learn about teamwork and cooperation. 

“I have a really great idea,” I said. “How about a report on plants? You 
know—how much water they need. Stuff like that.” 

“That’s a really great idea,” Roxanne replied. “If you’re in kindergarten.” 

“Okay. Okay. Let me think.” I stood up and paced the room. “Got it! How 
about the life cycle of a moth? We could catch some—and see how long they 
take to die!” 

Roxanne stared at me. She nodded her head thoughtfully. “I think... that’s 
really stupid,” she said. 

So much for teamwork and cooperation. 

“Fine.” I folded my arms in front of me. “Why don’t you try to come up 
with an idea?” 

“I already have,” Roxanne declared. “I think we should do a report on True 
Haunted Houses. I know a haunted house right here in Middletown. It’s near the 
woods. Across from the college. I bet we’ll find a real ghost living there!” 

“There are no haunted houses in Middletown,” I said. “I know all about 
haunted houses—and there isn’t one anywhere near here.” 

“The house near the woods is haunted,” Roxanne insisted. “And that’s what 
we should study for our report. I’ll talk to the ghost and take notes. Your job will 



be to videotape us.” 

Roxanne never backs down. 

Sometimes that’s what I like about her. 

And sometimes that’s what I hate about her. Like now. 

“Don’t waste your time, Roxanne. I’m practically an expert on ghosts. That 
house is not haunted.” I tried to give Roxanne some good advice. 

A bad mistake. 

“You just don’t want to videotape us. You want to be the one who talks to 
the ghost and takes the notes,” she accused. 

I let out a sigh. 

“But it was my idea—so I get to pick first,” Roxanne said. “Ms. Starkling 
will go crazy when we find a real ghost for our project. We’ll probably win an 
award or something.” 

“We won’t find any ghosts in this town.” I shook my head. “This place is 
too boring. Nothing exciting ever happens here....” 

I stopped talking. 

A low, frightening moan filled the room. 

Roxanne jumped off the bed. 

She moved close to me. 

We slowly turned toward the sound. Coming from the hall. 

“Wh-what’s that?” Roxanne’s voice shook, pointing to the doorway. 

We both stared in horror—at an eerie light just outside my room. An eerie 
white light. 

We took a step back. 

The light grew brighter. 

Closer. 

It filled the doorway now. 

I held my breath. 

“Sammy —what is it?” Roxanne’s voice quivered. 

“I—I don’t know.” 

I watched the strange white light begin to roll and shimmer and stretch—as 
it reached for us. 



3 


We backed up against the wall. 

The light grew stronger, whiter. 

Blinding now. 

Another moan floated toward us—and I gasped. 

“A... ghost!” I cried. “No. It’s a... Dad?” 

Dad stepped into the room. Carrying some sort of bright light. 

“That’s about as real a ghost as youTl ever find!” Dad laughed. 

My heart stopped pounding. 

Brutus let out a loud wail and darted from the room. 

“Whoa—I didn’t think anything could scare that cat!” Dad laughed again. 

Mom burst into the room. “You said you were bringing that laser light home 
to repair it. Not to terrify these kids,” she scolded Dad. 

“Give me a break. It was just a joke.” Dad turned to us. “You thought it was 
funny—right, Sammy? Roxanne?” 

“Yeah... very funny, Dad,” I said, rolling my eyes. “One of your best jokes. 
Areal riot.” 

“I knew it was a laser light.” Roxanne moved back toward the bed. She sat 
down, trying to look cool. “When I saw how scared Sammy was, I played along. 
Super trick, Mr. Jacobs. We really fooled Sammy!” 

We really fooled Sammy! We? 

I wanted to strangle Roxanne. 

Sometimes I hate her. HATE her. 

Simon wandered into the room, carrying Brutus. “Your stupid cat ran over 
my body-tracing. He ruined it. Now I have to start all over again.” 

Simon let Brutus drop to the floor. He glanced at the light Dad held in his 
hand. Then he looked at me. 

“Sammy didn’t fall for that dumb light trick—did he?” he asked. 

“Why don’t you go watch your toes grow!” I shouted at my brother. 

“No. This is a different dumb light trick,” Dad chuckled. 

Mom cleared her throat—a warning to Dad. 

“Actually, Simon, this light is called a Molecule Detector Light.” Dad tried 



to turn serious. “Here—have a look at it.” He handed the light to Simon. 

It looked like a regular flashlight—but it definitely wasn’t. 

A regular flashlight didn’t shine with a shimmery, white, blinding light. 
“What does it do?” Simon studied the shiny silver casing that housed the 

laser. 

“It’s kind of like an X-ray,” Dad explained. “I can shine it in the air and see 
all kinds of insects and things that you normally can’t see.” 

“I know what we can use it for.” Simon turned the light toward me. “We 
can use it to find Sammy’s BRAIN!” 

Everyone laughed. Even Mom. 

“Hey! Good one!” Roxanne patted Simon on the back. “That’s the first time 
I ever heard you make a joke.” 

“I wasn’t joking,” Simon said flatly. 

That made everyone laugh even harder. 

“Out!” I yelled. “I want you all to leave!” 

Mom, Dad, and Simon left the room. Still laughing. 

“What about our math homework?” Roxanne demanded. “I thought we 
were going to do it together.” 

“I don’t feel like doing it now,” I grumbled. 

“Okay. Okay.” Roxanne backed out of the room. “You don’t have to do it. 
But I do. Ms. Starkling said it’s my turn at the chalkboard tomorrow. I want to 
make sure I get the equations right.” 

Roxanne left to do her homework. 

I opened my math book to do mine. 

I stared down at the numbers. 

But I couldn’t concentrate. 

I’ll get up early, I decided. And do my homework in the morning. 

I got up from my desk to change for bed. 

Brutus jumped into my desk chair—his favorite place to sleep. 

I crossed the room—and tripped on something in the middle of the floor. 
“Hey—what was that?” I spun around. 

I glanced at the floor. 

“Huh?” 

Nothing there. 



4 


I stared at the floor. 

I shook my head. 

I tripped over— nothing? 

It’s a good thing Roxanne didn’t see this one, I thought. I could hear her 
making fun of me now. “Practicing—to make sure we lose the race next week, 
Sammy?” 

I got into bed. 

I propped up my pillows and picked up the ghost-story book I was reading. 
I stared down at the page, but it was all just a blur. 

I closed the book and drifted off to sleep. But I tossed and turned all night 
long. Half asleep, half awake, I fluffed up my pillow. I pulled the covers up 
around me. I drifted off again—then woke up to a noise. 

Flapping. 

The flapping of my curtains in the night breeze. 

I sat up. I rubbed my eyes. 

I stared at the window. 

The open window! 

I bolted out of bed and slammed it shut. 

Who opened this window? WHO? 

Is it possible for a window to slide up? 

NO. 

It must be Simon. Simon must be playing a joke on me, I decided. 

But it couldn’t be Simon. Simon doesn’t play jokes. He’s always serious. 

I climbed back in bed—and stared at the window. Watching. Waiting. 
Waiting to see it open. 

But my eyelids grew heavy and I fell asleep. 

The next morning I woke up late. Brutus always wakes me up. But he didn’t 
today. 

I bolted up in bed to check the window. Closed. 

I glanced at my desk chair. Brutus was gone. 



I dressed quickly. I caught my reflection in the mirror as I headed out of my 
room. I looked wrecked. 

“Sammy, you look awful,” Mom said. “Did you get to bed late last night?” 

I slumped down at the kitchen table. Dad sat across from me, reading the 
newspaper. 

“No, not too late,” I told Mom. 

Dad peered over the newspaper. “You’re reading too many of those ghost 
books, Sammy. If you read about real science, you’d sleep better.” 

Dad went back to his newspaper. 

Mom poured some cereal into my breakfast bowl. I ate one spoonful—and 
Simon called me. 

“Sammy—come up here,” he shouted from his bedroom. “I need your 
help.” 

I ignored him. 

I ate another spoonful. 

“SAM-MY!” he screamed. 

“Sammy, go see what your brother wants,” Mom ordered. 

“SAM-MY! SAM-MY!” 

“WHAT?” I cried, charging into his room. “What’s your problem?” 

“That!” he said, pointing to the bed. “That is my problem.” 

Brutus lay curled up in Simon’s bed. 

“He slept in here last night,” Simon said. “And now I can’t get him out. He 
won’t move.” 

“Brutus slept in here?” 

I couldn’t believe it. 

Brutus always sleeps in my room. Always. 

“Yes, he slept in here,” Sammy said. “And I want him out!” 

“What’s the big deal? Just leave him there.” I turned to the door. 

“Wait!” Simon yelled. “I can’t leave him there. I can’t!” 

“Why not?” I asked, confused. 

“Because I have to make my bed,” Simon answered. 

I stared hard at my brother. “What planet are you from?” 

“Sammy,” Simon whined. “I have to make my bed. Mom says.” 

“Just make the bed over him. Mom won’t notice the lump.” 

I returned to the kitchen a few seconds later. I sat down at the table. 



Mom peered over my shoulder. “Sammy, how did you finish your cereal so 
fast?” 

“Huh?” 

I stared down into my breakfast bowl. 

Totally empty! 



5 


“Someone—someone ate my cereal!” I stammered. 

“You’re right!” Mom gasped. “It must have been a ghost!” 

Mom and Dad laughed. 

I stared at the empty bowl—and the spoon. 

“Look!” I shouted. “Someone did eat my cereal. I have proof. The spoon— 
it’s on the left side of the bowl. I always put my spoon on the right side of the 
bowl—because I’m right-handed. See?” 

I pointed to the spoon. 

To the proof. 

“Stop kidding around, Sammy. You’re going to be late for school.” Mom 
turned to Dad. “We’d better get going too.” 

“Did you do it?” I asked Dad as he reached for his briefcase. “Did you eat 
my cereal? Did you move the spoon? Was it a joke?” 

“You’re reading too many ghost stories,” Dad said. “Way too many.” Then 
he and Mom hurried off for work. 

For a few minutes, I sat at the kitchen table. Just sat there, staring into my 
empty cereal bowl. 

Someone ate my cereal. 

I am not going crazy, I told myself. 

Someone ate my cereal. 

But who? 

“Sammy. Sammy.” 

Huh? 

“Sammy, would you like to tell us what is so fascinating outside?” Ms. 
Starkling crossed her arms in front of her, waiting for my answer. 

A few kids giggled. 

I had been gazing out the classroom window. Thinking—about my window. 
My open bedroom window. And my disappearing cereal. 

“Uh—no. I mean, nothing,” I said. “I mean—I wasn’t looking at anything.” 
Some more giggles. 



“Sammy, come up to the chalkboard, please, and show the class how to 
finish this equation.” 

“But it’s Roxanne’s turn,” I blurted out. “I mean, isn’t Roxanne supposed to 
show the class today?” 

“Sammy, please.” Ms. Starkling tapped the chalkboard with a piece of 
chalk. “Now.” 

I glanced at Roxanne. She just shrugged her shoulders. 

I was in big trouble. 

I didn’t do my math homework last night. And I didn’t do it this morning, 
either—because Brutus didn’t wake me up on time. 

My temples pounded as I made my way to the front of the classroom. I 
walked slowly. Staring at the equation. Trying to figure out how to solve it 
before I got up there. 

I had no idea. 

Ms. Starkling handed me the piece of chalk. 

Silence fell over the classroom. 

I stared hard at the numbers on the board. 

My palms began to sweat. 

“Read the equation out loud,” Ms. Starkling suggested. She said it nicely. 
But I could tell she was losing her patience. 

I read the equation out loud. 

It didn’t help. 

I lifted the chalk to the board, even though I still didn’t know what to do. 

I stared at the numbers some more. 

I heard the sounds of kids shifting impatiently in their seats. 

I placed the chalk against the board—and gasped. 

I felt something squeeze my hand. Something cold and wet. 

My knees started to shake. 

I felt hot breath right up against my face. 

I tried to step back—but I couldn’t move. 

Something squeezed my fingers tighter and tighter. Squeezed until it hurt. 

The breathing against my face grew more rapid—sharp gasps that stung my 
cheeks. 

I wanted to pull free. But then my hand started to move across the 
chalkboard. 

My hand was moving—and it started to write! 



Someone was writing numbers for me! Someone was holding my hand! 
Moving it! Solving the equation! 

Someone I couldn’t see! 



6 


I yanked my hand back. I jerked free of the clammy, invisible grip. 

Then I dropped the chalk—and started screaming. 

And ran from the room. 

I ran into the hall. I leaned against the wall outside the classroom. My hands 
were shaking. My knees trembled. 

I could still feel the cold, ghostly fingers wrapped around my hand. 

I heard Roxanne inside—volunteering to finish the equation. 

“Sammy.” Ms. Starkling met me out in the hall. “What happened? Are you 
sick? Would you like to see the school nurse?” 

“I’m—I’m not sick,” I stammered. 

I didn’t want to explain what happened. 

I couldn’t explain it. I didn’t even want to try. 

“Are you sure you don’t want to see the nurse? You don’t look well.” Ms. 
Starkling felt my forehead. 

“No. I’m okay,” I lied. “I—I just felt a little dizzy—because I didn’t eat 
breakfast this morning.” 

Ms. Starkling believed me. She sent me to the lunchroom to get something 
to eat. 

As I made my way down the hall, I could still feel the clammy hand 
gripping my fingers. 

Still feel the hot breath on my face. 

Still feel the cold force as it pushed my hand along the board. Guiding it. 
Writing the numbers for me. 

I shivered. 

Maybe Dad is right. Maybe I have been reading too many ghost stories. 

I walked home alone after school. I wanted to be by myself. To think. 

I heard footsteps behind me. Footsteps pounding the pavement. Running 
toward me. 

“Sammy—wait up!” It was Roxanne. 

I pretended I didn’t hear her. I kept walking. 



“Sammy!” Roxanne caught up—out of breath. “What happened to you 
today?” 

“Nothing happened.” 

“Something happened,” she insisted. “Something happened to you in math 
class.” 

“I don’t want to talk about it,” I told her. 

“I’m really good at math,” Roxanne said smugly. “I’d be happy to help you 
—if you don’t understand it.” 

“I... don’t... need... help,” I replied through gritted teeth. I began to walk 
faster—but Roxanne kept up with me. 

We didn’t talk. 

Finally, Roxanne broke the silence. “Let’s go to the haunted house Saturday 
night. For our project. Okay?” 

“Maybe. I have to get home now. I’ll call you later to talk about it.” 

I broke into a run—and left Roxanne on the sidewalk, staring after me. 

I wanted to get home. 

I wanted to think about everything that had happened. 

I wanted to think about it—by myself. 

As I headed into the house, I wondered about my bedroom window. Would 
it be open? I made sure it was closed before I left this morning. But that didn’t 
mean anything. 

I started up the stairs. But I stopped when I heard Brutus meowing loudly in 
the kitchen. He always does that when he wants to go out. 

“Okay. Okay. I’m coming.” 

Brutus started to wail. 

“Hold it down, Brutus. I said I was—” 

I stopped in the kitchen door. 

There was Brutus—crouched on a chair. His fur stood straight up. He pulled 
back his lips in a menacing hiss. 

I followed his gaze—and let out a shriek. 

A pizza sat on the table. 

A slice from the pie floated above the plate—floated up by itself. 

I stared in shock as it rose higher and higher. 

“Who—who’s there?” I stammered. “I know someone is there! Who ARE 


you?” 



7 


“Who are you?” I demanded again. 

No answer. 

I stared at the pizza slice. Stared as it floated in midair. 

I watched as it was chewed up. Bite by bite. 

“Tell me who you are!” I shouted. “You’re really scaring me!” 

Another bite disappeared from the floating slice of pizza. And another. 

“This isn’t happening. It can’t be,” I whispered. 

I’ll close my eyes. When I open them—I’ll see that I imagined the whole 
thing, I told myself. 

And I’ll never read a ghost book again, I promised. 

Or watch a sci-fi movie. 

Another bite of the pizza disappeared. 

I closed my eyes. 

I opened them. 

The slice of pizza was gone. 

I let out a long sigh of relief. 

Then I realized it was gone—EATEN. 

“WHO ARE YOU?” I demanded. “Tell me—right now. Or I’ll—” 

“Sammy—who are you talking to?” Mom stood in the kitchen doorway, 
staring at me. 

“There’s someone here!” I cried. “Someone eating pizza!” 

“I can see that!” Mom said. “I can see that someone has eaten half a pizza 
—before dinner. Sammy, you know you’re not supposed to eat before dinner!” 

“I didn’t! It wasn’t me!” I cried. 

“Of course it wasn’t you,” Mom said. “It was the ghost from this morning 
—right? The one who ate your cereal. Sammy, please. This is serious. How 
many times have I told you—no snacking before dinner. You’re old enough to 
know better!” 

“But, Mom—” 

“No huts! I want you to go up to your room and straighten it up before we 
eat,” Mom ordered. “You left it a mess this morning. Please put your dirty 



clothes in the hamper and make your bed.” 

“But half the day is over. It doesn’t make sense to make my bed now,” I 
argued. 

“Sam-my!” Mom narrowed her eyes. Mom narrows her eyes when she’s 
angry. Right now her eyes were really narrowed. “GO!” 

Mom opened the refrigerator to get a drink. 

I turned to leave the kitchen—and froze. 

Right behind Mom, Brutus started to rise up from the kitchen chair. 
Floating up. Rising higher and higher. 

His fur stood straight up. He gazed down at the floor and let out a cry. He 
stretched out his paws to leap— 

“Mom, look!” I cried. “Look at Brutus!” 

Mom whirled around—too late. Brutus had landed safely back on the 
kitchen chair. 

Mom’s eyes grew really, really narrow. “Go up to your room now, Sammy!” 

What could I do? 

I left the kitchen and headed for the stairs. I turned into my room—and 
gasped. 

My room! 

My room looked like a garbage dump. 

Cereal boxes were strewn on the bed. Greasy food containers and crushed 
juice boxes littered my desk, my dresser, my chair—everywhere. 

I took a step inside and heard a loud crunch. I glanced down—and groaned. 
Frosted Flakes and Corn Pops carpeted the floor. 

“Who did this?” I cried. “WHO TRASHED MY ROOM?” 

I collapsed on my bed—and felt something sticky on the back of my pants. 
“Oooh, gross!” I moaned. “Peanut butter and jelly.” 

I pulled back the blanket for a clean place to sit—and found strands of last 
night’s spaghetti and some half-eaten chicken legs. 

“Who would do this?” I shook my head. “WHO?” 

Does Simon’s room look like this? I wondered. And Mom and Dad’s room? 
I ran down the hall to check. 

Simon’s room was spotless. Mom and Dad’s room was perfectly clean too. 

I walked back to my room—and froze. 

“Sammy!” Mom planted her hands firmly on her hips. Her face burned red 
with anger. “What have you done?” 



8 


“I—I didn’t do it, Mom!” I cried. “I didn’t make this mess!” 

“Give me a break,” Mom sighed. “If you didn’t do it, who did? I didn’t do 
it! Your father didn’t do it! Simon didn’t do it! Tell me, Sammy—who did it?” 

“M-maybe it was Simon.” I didn’t know what else to say. But I shouldn’t 
have said that. 

“First you trash your room. Then you try to blame your little brother! 
Sammy—I don’t know what’s gotten into you! I don’t want to see you 
downstairs until this room sparkles. Your father and I will discuss what to do 
about you later.” 

Mom turned to leave. “And don’t come down for dinner. You’ve eaten quite 
enough!” 

I stood in the center of my room and listened to Mom’s footsteps fade down 
the stairs. 

“How am I going to clean this mess?” I moaned. “It will take me a year.” 

“I’ll help you.” 

Who said that? 

I spun around to face the doorway. 

No one there. 

“Come on, Sammy,” a boy’s voice urged. “Let’s get going, or we’ll never 
clean up this mess.” 

I watched in disbelief as a cereal box floated up from my bed. Floated up 
and threw itself into the trash. 

“Who—who are you?” I stammered. “How do you know my name?” 

Another cereal box started to rise. And another. They tossed themselves 
into the trash too. 

I waited for the boy to answer me. 

But he didn’t. 

I stared at the last cereal box—waiting for it to rise up. 

It didn’t move. 

“Where are you?” I whispered. 

No answer. 



I scanned my bedroom—searching for a sign of him. Where did he go? 

I heard a rustling sound and spun around. 

My pillow hovered in the air. I watched as the pillowcase slid off it—all by 
itself! 

“Where are the clean sheets, Sammy? You know, you should make your bed 
in the morning—like Simon.” 

“How do you know me?” My voice started to rise. “How do you know my 
name? Who are you?” 

“Calm down,” the boy said. “No reason to get stressed. I arrived last night. I 
found out your name from Roxanne.” 

“You—you know Roxanne?” I sputtered. 

“No. I don’t know Roxanne. I heard her use your name last night,” he 
explained. “When she came over to do homework with you.” 

“What... are... you?” I asked slowly. 

My heart pounded as I waited for the boy’s answer. But he didn’t answer 
me. 

“WHAT ARE YOU?” I cried out. “Tell me! WHAT ARE YOU? Are you 
a... GHOST?” 



9 


“A ghost!” The boy broke into a fit of laughter. 

“You don’t believe in ghosts—do you?” the boy asked. 

“No, of course not,” I shouted. “I don’t believe in ghosts. I just believe in 
invisible kids!” 

“Okay. Okay. I see your point,” he said. “No—I’m not a ghost. I’m alive.” 

A loud, scraping sound cut through the air. 

I jumped in surprise—and saw my chair move out from my desk. 

“I hope it’s okay if I sit down,” he said. “Wow—is it hot in here.” 
Yesterday’s math homework floated up from my desk and began fanning the air. 

“Are you the one who keeps opening my bedroom window?” I demanded. 

“Uh-huh. It’s really hot up here. Why do you keep it so hot in your room?” 
he asked. 

“Forget about the window!” I said. “What do you want? Why are you here? 
Did you trash my room?” 

“Uh... I guess I really made a mess in here. I was really hungry. Sorry. But 
I’ll help you clean up.” The boy’s voice grew softer. “I just want to be your 
friend, Sammy.” 

“That’s ridiculous!” I said. “How can you be my friend? I can’t even see 
you! You’re invisible!” 

“I know,” the boy said softly. He sounded kind of sad. “I’ve been invisible 
for as long as I can remember. That’s why it’s so hard to have friends.” 

“Well—where are your parents?” I asked. 

“I don’t know. I really don’t. My parents left me here for some reason. I 
don’t know where they went. I know my name. That’s about it. My name is 
Brent Green, and I’m twelve.” 

Brent Green. An invisible boy. Right in my room. 

It was hard to believe. 

I mean, I’ve read a ton of science-fiction books. And I really believe in a lot 
of that stuff. But an invisible boy right in my room. Whoa! 

“Brent, I don’t know if I can be friends with you. I mean—this is weird.” 

“Sammy, who are you talking to?” Simon walked into my room. He 
glanced around. “Hey! There’s no one here. Were you talking to yourself?” 



I turned away from my desk chair. “Yeah, Simon. I was talking to myself.” 

I didn’t want to tell Simon about Brent. Not yet anyway. I wanted to find 
out more about him first. 

I wanted to be an expert on invisible people before I told anyone in my 
family! 

“You’re nuts, Sammy. You’re really nuts.” Simon gazed around the room. 
“Boy, this place is a total mess. How could you do this? No wonder Mom is so 
angry. You are in major trouble. Major trouble.” 

Simon picked up a chicken bone from my bed. “Yuck!” He held it between 
two fingers, then let it drop back on the sheet. “That’s gross!” 

He tiptoed carefully over the cereal on the floor. 

He slowly made his way to my chair. Brent’s chair. 

“Don’t sit there—” I tried to warn Simon. 

But it was too late. 



10 


I watched as the chair flew out from under Simon. Flew out—all by itself. 

Simon landed hard on the floor! He sat in a glob of grape jelly, his mouth 
gaping open in shock. 

“That was mean, Sammy! I’m telling Mom!” 

“I didn’t do anything!” I protested. “You missed the chair. It was your own 
fault!” 

Simon struggled to his feet and marched out of my room. 

“Ha! Ha!” Brent laughed. “Good one! Right, Sammy? I pulled the chair 
right out from under him!” 

Simon was downstairs right now—telling Mom what a horrible thing I had 
done to him. But I was already in trouble, I decided. So what difference did it 
make? And I had to admit it—watching Simon fall was pretty funny. 

Maybe having an invisible friend wouldn’t be too weird after all. I mean—it 
could be kind of fun. 

“Brent—what is it like to be invisible? I mean—can you walk through 
things?” I asked. 

“No,” Brent answered. “I can’t walk through anything.” 

“Are you... uh... dressed?” I asked. 

Brent laughed. “Don’t worry, Sammy. I’m dressed,” he said. Then he 
sighed loudly. “You know, I’m just a regular kid. I’m just like you—only 
invisible.” 

I’m just like you—only invisible. 

Suddenly I had a great idea. 

“Brent, could you make me invisible? Just for a little while. So I could see 
what it’s like?” 

“I wish I could. That would be fun. But I don’t know how to make someone 
invisible. Sorry,” he apologized. “Hey! I think we’d better get back to work here. 
This place is still a disaster.” 

Brent and I finished cleaning the room just as the front doorbell rang. 

I heard Mom answer it. A second later Roxanne burst into my room, 
carrying about a thousand books. She let them drop to the floor with a crash. 

“Hi, Sammy.” She smiled. “I came over to help you with your homework. I 



brought all my math books.” 

“Boy, am I glad you’re here!” I said. 

Roxanne smiled. “I knew you’d want my help.” 

“Not with that.” I shoved her books aside. “I want you to meet someone. 
His name is Brent—and he’s an invisible boy. And he’s here! Right in this 
room!” 

Roxanne’s eyes opened wide. “An invisible boy?” she whispered. 

“Yes!” I said. “He’s here!” 

Roxanne glanced around my room—and screamed. “I—I see him!” 

“You DO?” I asked. 

“Yes!” she repeated, pointing to my desk. “I see him. He’s standing right 
there!” 



11 


“You can see him?” I gasped, amazed. 

I faced my desk. 

I squinted. 

Stared really hard. 

I didn’t see a thing. 

Roxanne laughed. “Gotcha!” 

She gave me a not-so-friendly clap on the back, and I stumbled forward. 
“I’m tired of this dumb game.” Roxanne groaned. “Do you want to do math or 
not?” 

“But—I’m not kidding,” I insisted. “This is not a joke.” 

Roxanne dropped down on my bed and sighed. 

“I’ll prove it to you,” I told her. “Watch.” 

I gazed around my room, trying to figure out where he was. “Brent—pick 
up one of Roxanne’s books from the floor,” I said. “Show her you’re here.” 

I lowered my gaze to the floor. Wait till she sees this! I thought. She’ll 
totally freak! 

I kept my eyes glued to the pile. Waiting for one of them to float up. 

Nothing happened. 

“PLEASE, Brent,” I begged. 

I grabbed a pencil from my desk. I held it out. “Take this pencil from me. 
Make it float across the room!” 

Nothing. 

Roxanne rolled her eyes. “Please! I don’t have time for these stupid jokes, 
Sammy. Besides, it’s not funny.” 

“Brent? Hey—Brent?” 

It was no use. Brent was not going to cooperate. 

I dropped into my desk chair and threw my hands up into the air. “Thanks, 
Brent. Thanks a lot.” 

“Ready for math?” Roxanne asked. 

“No. I’m not ready,” I snapped. 

“You don’t have to yell,” she said. “Actually—I came over for another 



reason.” She slid off the bed and started collecting her math books from the 
floor. 

“I came over to see if we’re going to the haunted house Saturday night or 

not.” 

“We don’t have to go to the haunted house,” I cried. “We can do our report 
right here. Right in my room. We can do our report on Brent. Brent—The 
Invisible Kid!” 

“Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.” Roxanne started to lift her big pile of books from the 
floor. “The Invisible Kid. Right.” 

My shoulders sagged. 

“Listen, Sammy. We have to start our project. It’s going to be the best report 
in the whole class. No—it will be the best report anyone ever did in the history 
of the whole school.” 

“Can’t we talk about this tomorrow, Roxanne? I’m really not in the mood 
right now.” 

I was tired—and hungry. I hadn’t eaten anything since lunchtime. And I 
wanted to try to talk to Brent again. 

“No! We cannot talk about this tomorrow!” I could see that Roxanne was 
beginning to lose her patience. “We have to start planning now. I want to go to 
Hedge House Saturday night.” 

“What’s Hedge House?” I asked. 

Roxanne sighed loudly. “Hedge House is the haunted house. The one near 
the college. That’s what it’s called. I’ve been reading all about it.” 

Roxanne shuffled through her pile of books. “Here it is! Here’s the book 
about Hedge House. Do you want to hear some of it?” 

Do I have a choice? I asked myself. I leaned back in my chair and tried to 
pay attention. 

Roxanne stood in the middle of the room and began to read. 

“There have been many stories about the horrors of Hedge House,” she 
started. “But the true horror began when the Stilson family moved into town. 
They moved into Hedge House. No one had lived there in years—because 
everyone knew the house was haunted. 

“Tall, dark hedges grew around the house, enclosing it, sealing it off from 
curious eyes. 

“Every year, the hedges grew taller and darker, until they turned the color of 
night and shaded the highest windows. 



“The local people knew why the hedges grew that way. ‘It’s the will of the 
ghost’, they’d say. ‘To keep the house chilly and dark—as cold and icy as the 
spirit itself.’ 

“Everyone knew that—everyone but the Stilson family. 

“From the day the Stilsons moved in, the Hedge House ghost visited ten- 
year-old Jeffrey Stilson’s bedroom. The ghost visited every night. 

“‘Jef-frey,’ the ghost moaned. ‘Jef-frey — I’ve been waiting for you.’ 

“Each night, Jeffrey woke up shaking, frightened. He stared hard into the 
darkness of his room, searching for the man behind the voice. But no one was 
ever there. 

“He told his parents about the nightly visits. Told them again and again. 

“But they didn’t believe him. 

‘“Jef-frey, I’ve been waiting for you,’ the ghost’s voice returned one very 
chilly evening. ‘I need you. ’ 

“‘What do you want?’ Jeffrey cried out. ‘Tell me what you want—’ 

“At the sound of Jeffrey’s voice, the ghost appeared. 

“It was the ghost of a young man. From a time long ago. Jeffrey could tell, 
from the clothes it wore—short, baggy black pants that ended below the knees. 
Black socks pulled up high to meet the pants cuffs. And black boots with shiny 
silver buckles. 

“Jeffrey stared at the ghost. 

“He stared in horror at its black shirt. At the right sleeve that hung loosely 
at the ghost’s side. The sleeve with no arm inside. 

“ ‘Come with me, Jeffrey, ’ the ghost moaned. ‘Come with me—to learn the 
secret of this awful house.’” 

Roxanne closed the book and placed it down on the bed. 

“What’s the secret?” I demanded. “What’s the secret of Hedge House?” 

“I don’t know. I haven’t gotten to that part yet,” Roxanne said. “But I can 
tell you this. I know some people who’ve been inside Hedge House. And they 
say all kinds of spooky things happen there.” 

“Like what?” I asked. 

“Well, they say the doors open and close all by themselves,” she replied. 

I gasped—as the door behind Roxanne opened and closed by itself. 

“That’s right, Sammy,” Roxanne said. “It does make you lose your breath 
when you think about it.” 

The door opened and closed again. 



Very funny, Brent! I thought. 

“And they say the books float right off the bookshelves,” Roxanne 
continued. 

Brent began juggling three of my schoolbooks behind Roxanne’s back. 
Round and round they went, with the middle one always popping up—right over 
Roxanne’s head! 

I couldn’t help myself. I started to laugh. 

“What’s so funny, Sammy?” Roxanne frowned at me. 

I raised my hand to point behind her. But the books floated back to the 
shelf. 

I sighed. “Nothing.” 

“Good. Because this is not funny. I’m very serious about this report. I want 
it to be the best. And I want you to take great video shots to prove the ghost of 
Hedge House really exists!” 

My video camera floated up from the floor, aimed itself at Roxanne’s back 
—and I burst out laughing again. 

“SAMMY!” Roxanne jumped up angrily. “Quit it!” she shouted. “I’m going 
to strangle you if you don’t stop laughing! This report means a lot to me. It’s not 
just the grade. If I really do find the ghost, it’s going to make me famous!” 

“Huh?” I stared at her. 

Roxanne took a deep breath. Then she continued. “They say the ghost really 
hates light. They say if a light shines on him, he explodes into a rage—and 
destroys anything that is in his path.” 

I heard a soft squeak. 

I glanced around the room—and saw the light-bulb in the ceiling fixture 
turning. Turning all by itself. 

Brent is standing on my dresser, I realized. He’s unscrewing the lightbulb! 

“Roxanne, quick!” I shouted. “Look up at the ceiling! See that? Now do 
you believe me!” 



12 


“Do you see it, Roxanne?” I jumped up from my chair—really excited. Now 
Roxanne would have to believe me! 

I pointed to the lightbulb as it slowly turned in the socket—by itself! 

“See!” I shouted. “Now you believe me—right? It’s the invisible kid!” 

I spun around. I couldn’t wait to see the amazed look on her face! 

Roxanne wasn’t amazed. 

In fact, I couldn’t even see her face. 

She was kneeling down, head bent, gathering her books up from the floor. 

I glanced back up at the ceiling. The lightbulb wasn’t turning anymore. 

“Roxanne! Why didn’t you look?” I cried. “You missed it! You should have 
looked when I told you to!” 

“I should have picked a different partner,” Roxanne groaned. “I’m tired of 
your dumb jokes, Sammy!” 

I collapsed back into my desk chair. 

Roxanne balanced the stack of books in her arms and headed for the door. 
“Oh, I get it!” She whirled around to face me. “Now I understand what you’re 
doing.” 

“Huh?” 

“If you don’t want to come with me to the haunted house—just say so!” 
Roxanne said. “You don’t have to make up these stupid stories.” 

Roxanne was angry. 

I usually enjoy making Roxanne angry. But not this time. 

“An idiot,” she mumbled under her breath. “You must think I’m a total 
idiot. I’m leaving now, Sammy. I’m leaving you —and your invisible friend!” 

Then she stormed out of my room. 

“Are you still here, Brent?” I asked, searching around. 

No answer. 

I jumped up from my chair. 

“I know you’re here, Brent. Why did you do that to me?” I clenched my 
fists into two tight balls. “Why didn’t you show Roxanne that you were here?” I 
cried angrily. 



Silence. 

“Okay. Okay. I’m sorry I yelled. I didn’t really mean to yell at you, Brent. I 
just wanted Roxanne to believe me.” 

I sat back down in my chair. 

I took a deep breath. 

“Did you hear me, Brent? I said I was sorry.” 

No answer. 

“Please answer me,” I pleaded. “I want to talk to you. I want to find out 
more about you!” 

The room remained silent. 

Brent was gone. 

For good? 



13 


Did Brent really leave? 

Did he leave because I yelled at him? I wondered. 

Would he come back? 

I was still asking myself these questions on the way to school the next 
morning. 

An invisible kid. 

An invisible kid was in my room yesterday. 

Whoa! 

This was hard to believe. 

I wanted to tell Mom and Dad about Brent last night. But I wasn’t allowed 
out of my room. Even after I had cleaned it up. 

That was Simon’s fault. He told them I made him fall. So Mom and Dad 
ordered me to stay in my room all night—and think about how lucky I was to 
have a younger brother. 

That took about a second. 

The rest of the night I thought about Brent. 

What did he really want? I wondered, as the school bus rumbled toward 
school. He says he wants a friend. But should I believe him? 

I mean—a kid shows up in your room. An invisible kid. That’s pretty weird 
right there. And then he says he just wants to be your friend. 

Suddenly, I had a bad feeling about him. 

He wants something from me. I just know it. I’ve read tons of books about 
ghosts... monsters... you name it. 

And I can tell you this. They always want something. Your body. Your 
brain. Your blood. Something. 

My body. That’s it. 

That has to be it. 

Brent is a ghost who wants to fool me into being his friend—so he can take 
over my body! 

The thought made me shudder. 

Last night, I’d been too shocked—too amazed—to be frightened of him. 



But now, I had time to think. And I was really getting scared. 

Why did he come to our house? To my room? 

Maybe I can make a deal with him, I thought. Leave me alone—and I’ll 
give you my brother! 

I knew Brent wouldn’t go for that one—but it made me smile. 

I didn’t smile for long, though. 

I walked into school and stopped inside the doorway. I saw Claire, a girl 
from my class, standing by the water fountain. 

“Sure. I’ll go with you after school,” I heard her say. “Don’t worry—I’ll be 
there.” 

My mouth dropped open. 

Claire was talking—to no one. 

I walked slowly to my locker. 

A boy I knew from art class struggled with his lock. “Why can’t I get this 
thing open?” he complained. “It never got stuck before.” 

He turned to his left and said, “Okay—you do it.” 

And there was no kid standing next to him. 

He was also talking to someone invisible! 

I stared down the long hall. 

It was filled with kids. Kids talking. Kids talking to invisible kids! 

The school is filled with them! I realized to my horror. 

The school is filled with invisible people! 



14 


“Sammy!” 

I turned to see who called my name—praying I could see who it was. 

I sighed with relief. 

It was Roxanne. 

“Roxanne! You’re not going to believe—” I started. Then I stopped. 

Roxanne was grinning. 

She walked up to me and laughed right in my face. 

All the other kids in the hall began to laugh too. 

“You—you told everyone?” I sputtered. “You told everyone about the 
invisible kid in my room?” 

Roxanne tried to speak, but she couldn’t. She was doubled over, laughing 
really hard now. She nodded yes. 

“How could you do this to me?” I screeched. 

“Calm down.” Roxanne patted me on the shoulder. “It was just a joke. You 
have to admit we all did a good job of keeping a straight face.” 

“Ha ha,” I said weakly. I didn’t think it was the least bit funny. I’m going to 
get Roxanne for this, I promised myself. I don’t know how—but I will. 

I headed into my classroom with my head down and took my seat quickly. 

The other kids piled into the room. Some of them were still laughing. When 
they saw me, they pretended to talk to invisible people again. 

My face turned red. 

“Everyone is so chatty this morning!” Ms. Starkling noted. “Time to settle 
down. Please take out your homework.” 

“Oh, no,” I groaned. 

I didn’t do my homework last night. I’d forgotten all about it. 

I glanced around the room. 

I was the only one without the assignment. 

“Please pass your homework to the front of the room,” Ms. Starkling said. 

Claire sat in front of me. She waited for me to pass my homework to her 
before she passed hers up. 

I tapped her on the shoulder. “I don’t have it,” I whispered. 



“Uh-oh,” she said. “Did the invisible boy eat it?” Everyone around me 
giggled. 

“Quiet down, class,” Ms. Starkling warned. She collected all the 
homework, then told us to open our math books. 

Ms. Starkling wrote an equation on the board. “Sammy, are you feeling 
better today?” she asked when she finished. 

I nodded yes. 

I mean—what else could I say? No. Ms. Starkling, Em not feeling better. I 
met an invisible kid last night in my room—and now no one will ever believe me. 
Everyone thinks I’m crazy. 

“Good,” Ms. Starkling said. “Would you please come up and show the class 
how to solve this?” 

I couldn’t catch a break today. 

I stood up. 

“Not you, Sammy,” Ms. Starkling said. “I was talking to him.” 

She pointed to the seat next to me. 

The empty seat next to me. 

I glanced up at Ms. Starkling, puzzled. 

“Your invisible friend,” she said. 

That sent the whole class into a new fit of laughter. 

Ms. Starkling laughed. “Sorry, Sammy. I had to get in on the joke too.” 

Sorry? I knew she wasn’t sorry. She was laughing too hard. 

I was so embarrassed. Totally humiliated. 

And that was just the beginning of the day. The afternoon was much worse. 

At lunch period, I went to the library. I took a seat by myself. 

I didn’t want to hear any more invisible boy jokes. 

I didn’t want to talk to anyone. 

I took my tuna sandwich out of my backpack. I placed it on my lap so Ms. 
Pinsky, the librarian, wouldn’t see it. We’re not supposed to eat in the library, 
and I didn’t want to get caught. 

Everyone in school knows that when the librarian gets angry—watch out. I 
remember when Claire made her angry. Ms. Pinsky made Claire write a hundred 
book reports, three pages each! That was last year—but Claire is still writing the 
reports. I think she’s only up to book number twenty. 

I unwrapped the sandwich—and gasped. 

The sandwich began to rise up. 



“Brent—put it down!” I whispered. “What are you doing here?” 

A bite disappeared from the sandwich. 

“I was lonely in your room, all by myself,” Brent said. “And hungry.” 
Another bite of my sandwich vanished. 

I snatched the sandwich away from him. I glanced nervously around the 
room. “You can’t stay here. You have to leave!” 

“Please, let me stay,” Brent begged. “It’s no fun at home without you. I 
need a friend.” 

“Everyone thinks I’m nuts!” My voice started to rise. “Totally NUTS! All 
the kids in school are laughing at me. Even my teacher is making fun of me! You 
can’t stay here, Brent. You can’t—” 

A shadow fell over the table. 

I glanced up. 

The librarian stood over me, frowning and shaking her head. 



15 


“Ssssammy!” she hissed. “Who are you talking to? And why are you talking in 
the library?” 

I gulped. 

Her eyes narrowed into two angry slits. She clenched her lips tightly 
together. 

Then she glanced down at my lap and gasped. “Is that... FOOD?” 

I’m doomed, I realized. I’ll be writing book reports for the rest of my life. 
Thanks, Brent. Thanks a lot. 

“Sammy! How could you?” the librarian exclaimed. “You’ve broken my 
two most important rules!” 

I grabbed onto my seat, waiting for her to really let me have it. But she 
didn’t. 

“This is so unlike you,” she said. Her voice grew kinder. “Would you like to 
talk to the guidance counselor after school today? You know, talking to yourself 
is a sign that you are troubled by something.” 

I glanced around the library—at everyone gaping at me. I could feel my 
face turning hot. I knew I was blushing. 

“No, I’m fine,” I insisted. 

“If something is bothering you—it’s nothing to be ashamed of.” The 
librarian took a seat next to me. 

Now everyone started to whisper. 

I wanted to disappear. 

“Nothing is troubling me. Really,” I insisted, shoving my sandwich back in 
my backpack. 

“Maybe you should have a chat with the guidance counselor anyway,” she 
continued. “I’m sure you’ll find Ms. Turnbull very easy to talk to. I’ll tell her 
you are going to stop by.” 

The librarian was not going to give up. 

“I can’t see Ms. Turnbull after school today. I’m in the relay race in the 
Olympics,” I said. “I can’t miss the race. My whole team is depending on me!” 

“Okay.” The librarian stood up to leave. “But will you promise me 
something?” 



Sure, I thought. I’ll promise you anything—as long as you leave. NOW. 

I nodded yes. 

“I want you to come and see me if anything is bothering you. Will you do 
that?” She patted me on the shoulder. 

I nodded again—and she went back to her desk. 

I slowly glanced around—to see if everyone was still staring at me. 

They weren’t. 

They were all busy talking. Talking to invisible friends. And laughing. 

I shaded my eyes from the sun. It beamed down brightly on the track field. 

The sky was a deep blue. 

The air felt warm. Nice. Not too hot. 

A perfect day for a race. 

I peered into the bleachers. They spilled over with kids from all the schools 
in town. 

More kids arrived, trying to push their way into seats. But the bleachers 
were packed. Kids shouted and shoved and laughed and joked. Everyone seemed 
totally wired. 

My team gathered at one end of the field. I jogged over to them. 

“Hey! Sammy!” Roxanne greeted me and slapped me a high five. “Great 
day for a race! I know we’re going to win—I can feel it!” And then she added, 
“Unless you mess up.” 

“You don’t have to worry about me, Roxanne. I can outrun you any day,” I 
shot back. 

I ran a practice lap around the field. I ran fast and strong. I was pumped up. 
I felt totally confident. 

Three of us were going to run the relay race. 

Jed would start. Jed is a great runner. He’s tall and skinny and can take 
really long strides. 

I would run next. Then Roxanne would finish up. 

The three of us were the fastest runners in the whole seventh grade. 

We couldn’t lose. 

The race was about to begin. I jumped up and down to keep my muscles 
warm. 

I glanced up into the stands—and saw some kids pointing at me. Some of 
them laughed. 



“Oh, noooo,” I moaned. I know what they’re talking about. My invisible 
friend. 

After this race, you are going to keep a promise you made this morning, I 
told myself. You are going to pay Roxanne back—no matter what it takes. 

All my muscles tensed up. 

“Relax. Relax,” I repeated over and over, bending forward and rubbing my 
leg muscles. 

“Ready, Sammy?” Jed high-fived me. “We’re counting on you!” 

“Ready!” I said. 

But I couldn’t stop thinking about the kids in the bleachers—the ones who 
laughed every time they looked at me. 

And I couldn’t stop thinking about Ms. Starkling—and how she made fun 
of me. 

And I couldn’t stop thinking about the librarian—who thought I was totally 

nuts. 

My muscles tightened even more. 

I concentrated hard. Concentrated on shoving all those thoughts out of my 
mind. 

I did some warm-up exercises. My muscles began to loosen up. I started to 
feel better. 

The referee took his place on the field. 

Jed, Roxanne, and I lined up in race order. 

The six teams from the other schools were ready too. We all waited for the 
referee’s signal. As soon as he blew his whistle, the first runner would run 
around the track once—then pass the baton to the next runner. 

I trained my eyes on the referee. My heart pounded. I took a deep breath. 
Then another. 

The whistle blew. 

The race was on! 

Cheers rang out as Jed took off! He ran faster than I’d ever seen him run 
before. Amazing! 

Roxanne and I cheered him on. “Go, Jed! Gooooo!” 

Jed reached the halfway mark before any of the other runners. 

He raced to the finish. Practically flying now. Holding out the baton. 
Holding it out so I could grab it—and run. 

I could hear his sneakers pounding the ground. Dust flew up behind him. 



His face was red. His eyes were wide. 

He was only a few feet away from me. 

I dropped into my racing position. 

I stuck out my hand. Jed stretched out his arm. I grabbed the baton from 
him. The cheers in the bleachers rose to a roar. Here I go! I thought. RUN! 



16 


My shoes pounded the track. I swung my arms hard, gripping the baton in my 
right hand. 

I took long strides, leaning forward, building a rhythm. Faster. Faster than 
I’d ever run. 

The cheers thundered in my ears. “Go, Sammy! Go! Go! Go!” 

That made me run even harder. 

It felt so awesome! 

Without slowing down, I glanced over my shoulder. 

I was way ahead of all the other runners. 

I reached the halfway mark—and sprinted forward. We were going to win 
this race! Yes! 

The three-quarter mark was coming up—and I wasn’t even out of breath. 
The other runners were struggling, still way behind. 

I leaned forward. Pounded the hard track. 

And gasped when I felt a hand grab my shoulder. 

Another hand grabbed my waist. 

“Hey—!” I cried. 

And then I realized what was happening. 

“Brent—get away! What are you doing?” I wailed. 

“I’m going to help you win!” he cried breathlessly. “I’m going to show you 
I’m your friend! Watch!” 

Before I knew what was happening— 

Before I could stop him— 

My feet lifted up off the ground—and I started to fly! 



17 


“No! Stop! Put me down! Put me down!” I shrieked. 

He ignored my cries. He raised me off the ground. 

I flew about a foot. And felt Brent stumble. 

“Let go! Let go!” I screamed. 

I waved my arms wildly, trying to regain my balance. I kicked my legs, 
trying to break free of Brent’s grasp. 

I let out an angry cry as I fell to the track. 

I landed hard on my knees and elbows. Then my head banged down on the 
sharp cinders. 

The baton flew from my hand. I gazed up—and watched in horror as it 
rolled across the field. 

“Ohhhhh.” 

“Sorry, Sammy,” Brent cried from close by. “I only wanted to help. But I 
tripped.” 

I looked up—in time to see the other runners racing by me. 

We were going to lose. Big time. 

I raised my eyes to Roxanne and Jed. They glared back at me. They shook 
their fists angrily at me. 

I sat up. My elbows were scraped raw. My knees were bleeding. 

“Brent! How could you do this to me?” I wailed. 

“I was only trying to help,” he repeated. 

Another runner raced by me. His sneakers kicked up a chunk of cinders and 
mud. SPLAT —into my eyes. 

I felt a hand trying to wipe the mud away. 

I swung out my arm and shoved Brent hard. 

“Ow!” he cried. “Hey—why do you have to be a sore loser? Winning isn’t 
everything, you know.” 

With my head down, I shuffled off the field. As I walked by the bleachers, 
some kids from my school booed me. 

I got some cheers too—mostly from kids on the other teams. 

I could feel Jed’s and Roxanne’s burning glares as I made my way over to 



them. 

Jed didn’t say a word. I think he was too angry to speak. 

Roxanne didn’t have that problem. 

“How could you—you stupid clumsy cretin!” she shrieked. “We could have 
won! You blew it. You really blew it this time!” 

“It wasn’t my fault!” I cried. “It was the invisible kid!” 

Ugh. Wrong thing to say. 

“I wish you were invisible! ” Roxanne cried in disgust. 

I wish I were invisible too, I thought. This has to be the most awful day of 
my life. 

Brent is ruining my life. 

Maybe having an invisible friend would be fun for another kid. But it was 
definitely not fun for me. 

I have to do something about Brent, I decided. 

I have to do something right away. 



18 


“Come on, Sammy. Be a good sport. Measure me.” Simon shoved a tape 
measure in my face. 

“I told you, Simon. You haven’t grown since yesterday! Now—leave me 
alone.” 

I had just returned home from the worst day of my life. I definitely was not 
in the mood to measure Simon. 

“My project is a loser.” Simon lowered his eyes. “A total loser.” 

It was hard not to feel sorry for Simon. He was so serious about his science 
project. 

I tried to cheer him up. “Simon, we just don’t grow that fast,” I said. 
“Maybe you should study something else. How about measuring a puppy? 
Puppies grow faster than we do. Much faster.” 

“But we don’t have a puppy,” Simon replied. 

“How about Brutus? You can measure Brutus,” I said, guiding Simon out of 
my bedroom. 

“Brutus isn’t going to grow any more,” Simon whined. “You know that. 
He’s too old.” 

“I’ll think about it,” I told him. “I’ll try to come up with something you can 
study. But I need to think—alone.” 

I gave Simon a soft shove out of my room. Then I closed the door. 

I flopped down on my bed. And pulled the covers over my head. 

I wanted to disappear. 

I couldn’t face anyone—not Roxanne, not my teacher, not the librarian. Not 
the whole seventh grade. 

I heard a noise. 

I whipped off the blanket—and saw my window sliding up. “Phew. Why is 
it so hot in here?” a familiar voice demanded. 

“Oh, noooo,” I groaned. “You’re back?” 

“Lighten up, Sammy. Why don’t we go out and play some ball or 
something? Take your mind off things. I’m a really good pitcher.” 

“Brent—you have to leave.” 

“Good idea. Let’s leave this stuffy house. We’ll go out. Get a pizza. I’m 



hungry,” he said. “You must be hungry too.” 

“I mean it. You have to go,” I said softly. I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. I 
just wanted him to go. 

“But I don’t want to leave,” Brent replied. “I want to be your best friend. I 
really do.” 

“I can’t be your best friend,” I told him. “It’s not working out.” 

“Just give it a chance,” he insisted. “We’re going to have a great time 
together. You’ll see....” 

“Sammy! Time for dinner!” Mom called up the steps. 

“I’m going downstairs to eat,” I told Brent. “And when I come back—” 

“Don’t worry, I’ll still be here,” he said cheerfully. 

He’s never going to leave, I realized as I headed down for dinner. Never. 
What am I going to do? How am I going to get rid of him? 

There was only one thing to do. 

I took my seat at the dinner table. “Mom. Dad. I have something important 
to tell you.” 

My parents gazed up from their plates. 

I took a deep breath while they waited for me to go on. 

“There’s an invisible kid in my room—and I need your help. I have to get 
rid of him!” 

I had to tell Mom and Dad. 

I didn’t know what else to do. 

Mom and Dad were really smart—for parents. They were scientists, after 
all. They’d know how to get rid of Brent. 

“Not now, Sammy,” Mom said impatiently. “Your father and I had a very 
hard day today. We worked for hours on the Molecule Detector Light—and it’s 
still not working properly.” 

She sighed. “After dinner we’re going down to the basement to work on it 
some more. So eat quickly. We don’t have time for your wild stories.” 

I felt a kick under the table. “Cut it out, Simon.” I glared at my brother. 

“It wasn’t me.” Simon smirked. “It was the invisible kid!” 

Great. Simon, the serious mutant, is trying to be funny. 

I kicked Simon back. 

“Hey—that hurt!” he whined. 

“It wasn’t my fault. Your legs are in the way. They must be growing. Quick! 
Measure them!” I snickered. 



“Ha ha.” Simon rolled his eyes. “Is the invisible kid as funny as you are?” 
He kicked me again. 

“Simon—” I started. 

“Cut it out, you two!” Dad shouted. 

I turned to Dad. “But there really is an invisible kid. You’ve got to believe 
me. I need your help.” 

“Not tonight,” Dad groaned. “Please. Your mom and I had such a terrible 

day.” 

I tried again. “He could be dangerous. He’s upstairs and—” 

“Sammy—not another word. I mean it,” Dad said. “No more crazy stories.” 
So much for smart parents. 

Now what am I going to do? I wondered as Mom placed our dinner on the 
table. I’ve got to get rid of Brent. But how? 

All through dinner, I thought and thought. And by the time Mom served 
dessert, I had an idea! 



19 


“Brent? Are you here?” 

I held out a few pieces of chicken wrapped in a napkin. It was easy 
sneaking it out of the dining room. 

Mom and Dad talked about work all through dinner. Light refraction. 
Frequency waves. The usual stuff. They didn’t pay any attention to me. 

And Simon was too busy worrying about his science project. He was still 
the same size. He even measured his fingernails, but they hadn’t grown, either. 

When no one was looking, I wrapped the chicken in my napkin and placed 
it in my lap—and Brutus wailed. 

Brutus loves chicken. 

He tried to jump into my lap. 

He clawed at the napkin. 

He wailed some more. 

“Can’t you do something about that cat?” Mom asked. “Your father and I 
can’t think.” 

“Come on, Brutus.” I shoved the napkin under my T-shirt. “Let’s go 
upstairs.” 

I jumped up from my chair and waved for Brutus to follow me. He let out a 
sharp cry—and ran in the other direction. 

Wow! Brutus knows! I realized. Brutus knows that something weird is 
upstairs in my room. 

I bet that’s why he won’t sleep in my room anymore! 

I hurried to my room and held out the chicken. “Brent—aren’t you 
hungry?” I stood in one spot. I turned in a circle, holding out the chicken. 

“I’m starving. Thanks. Thanks a lot.” I felt a light tug as Brent took the 
food from my hand. 

I watched the napkin unfold by itself. 

“Mmmm. Fried chicken.” A big bite disappeared. “This is excellent. Your 
mom is a great cook! Thanks.” 

“Roxanne’s mom is a great cook too,” I said. “Better than my mom. Much 
better. I eat at Roxanne’s house all the time. Whenever I can.” 

Brent kept on eating. 



“You should eat at Roxanne’s. You’d see what I mean.” 

Brent kept on eating. 

“Hey! I just thought of a great idea!” I said. “You should be Roxanne’s best 
friend. Roxanne needs a ghost for our school project. You could be the ghost! 
That would make Roxanne so happy! She would have a ghost right in her own 
house. And you’d be happy too—eating all that great food! Come on! I can take 
you over there right now!” 

Brent stopped eating. 

“I am not going to Roxanne’s house,” he declared. “She’s a girl. I don’t 
want to be a girl’s best friend. I want to be your best friend. And I already told 
you—I am not a ghost.” 

The empty napkin floated toward me. “Is there any more chicken?” he 
asked. “I’m still hungry! And how about some dessert?” 

I sat down on my bed and waited for Brent to finish his second helping of 
chicken and the bowl of ice cream I sneaked upstairs for him. 

Then I tried again. “Brent, you have to leave. You have to go.” 

“But I want to be your best friend!” he insisted. “I’m never leaving. 
NEVER!” 

“Don’t you get it? I don’t want you to be my friend,” I told him. “I have 
plenty of friends—at least I did, until you came along.” 

I stood up and paced back and forth across my room. “You are ruining my 
life,” I said. “I want you to leave. I want you to get out of my house and never 
come back!” 

Silence. 

“Do you hear me?” 

More silence. 

“I know you’re here, Brent. Answer me!” 

“Please—can we talk later?” he finally replied. “I’m way tired. I need to get 
some rest.” 

The covers on my bed began to fold down. Then an invisible hand punched 
the pillow. 

“Ahhhh,” Brent sighed. “Your bed is so great!” 

That’s when I lost it. “We cannot talk later. We have to talk now. I want you 
to get out!” I screamed. “NOW!” 

“Really?” Brent’s voice changed. Deeper—and meaner. A lot meaner. 



“Y-yes. Really,” I stammered. 

“And what if I won’t go?” he asked. 

I took a step back—away from the bed. 

I didn’t like the way Brent said that. It sounded like a threat. 

“Well, Sammy—what if I won’t go?” he repeated menacingly. 

I took another step back—and felt a hot hand clamp down on my shoulder. 
I tried to break free—but I couldn’t. He was too strong. 

Brent grabbed my arm. He held it tightly. 

“Leave me alone!” I shouted. “Let me go!” 

But he started to pull me—toward the open window! 



20 


What did he plan to do? 

Push me out the window? 

“Stop! Let go! Hey—let go!” I shot my arms up—and broke free. 

“Sorry,” Brent muttered. “I was just goofing. You know. Good friends 
wrestle sometimes—right? Just for fun?” 

“Fun?” I cried weakly. My heart pounded in my chest. 

He’s dangerous, I realized. 

I don’t think he was kidding around. I think he wanted to shove me out the 
window. 

Frightened, I turned and started to run to the door. But I stumbled over his 
invisible feet and fell hard to the floor. 

Before I could scramble up, I felt his strong hands grab me again. 

“Let go!” I screeched, my voice high and shrill in panic. 

“I was just trying to help you up,” Brent said. 

His hands released me. 

I rubbed my sore wrists. 

“Really. I was just helping you up,” Brent insisted. “You believe me, don’t 
you? Say you believe me.” 

“Okay. Okay,” I grumbled. “I believe you.” 

“Great!” Brent cheered. 

“But you still have to leave,” I told him. “Everyone already thinks I’m too 
weird. I can’t have an invisible boy following me around, talking to me, living in 
my bedroom. Now go. Really. I mean it.” 

“But I can help you,” Brent cried. “I helped you already—with that math 
equation.” 

“Oh, yeah. You helped me all right.” I started pacing my room again. “You 
helped me look like a total geek in front of all my friends—and my teacher.” I 
winced just thinking about it. 

“Okay. I made a mistake. One little mistake,” Brent said. 

“ONE little mistake!” My voice started to rise. “What about in the library 
today? Now the librarian thinks I’m totally crazy. She wants me to see the 



guidance counselor!” 

I couldn’t help myself. I was yelling at him now. “And what about the track 
race? You ruined everything! You made me fall and lose the race. You made me 
disappoint everyone.” 

“Sorry,” Brent said softly. “I thought I could help you win. I just wanted to 
give you a boost.” 

“A boost?” I screamed. “You—you—” 

My closet door opened. 

My new, dark-blue Yankees baseball jacket floated out. “Hey—cool 
jacket!” Brent exclaimed. “I think the sleeves are too long, though. I don’t think 
it will fit me.” 

The jacket slid off the hanger. 

“Give that to me!” I snatched the jacket out of the air. “Now—leave! I don’t 
want you here.” 

“Sammy—who on earth are you yelling at?” Mom stood in my bedroom 
doorway. 

“The invisible kid!” I cried. “He’s here! He’s right here! You’ve got to 
believe me! Brent—say something!” 

Silence. 

“PLEASE, Brent!” I begged. 

Nothing. 

Mom walked over to me slowly, staring at me, shaking her head. She placed 
a hand on my forehead. “You don’t seem to have a fever.” 

“I’m not sick, Mom. I’m fine. Really. And I’m telling the truth.” 

“I don’t know...” Her voice trailed off. Then she studied me carefully. 
“Where are you going?” she asked. 

“I’m not going anywhere,” I said. 

“Then why are you holding your jacket?” 

I stared down at the jacket. “Oh, I just wanted to see if it still fits,” I lied. I 
mean—what else could I say now? 

“Of course it still fits. We bought it for you last week.” Mom stared hard at 
me. She placed her hand on my forehead again. “I don’t know,” she repeated. 
“You haven’t been yourself lately.” 

She glanced at my jacket again. Then she shook her head some more. “Now 
tell me—who were you shouting at?” 

“Uh... no one. I was just rehearsing my lines... for the school play.” 



“You’re in the school play?” she asked. 

“Uh... no. Not exactly,” I said. “I’m rehearsing... in case they ask me to be 
in it.” 

“Sammy, if something is bothering you—you know you can always tell me 
about it. Right?” 

“Right,” I said. 

Mom felt my forehead for the third time. She shook her head—again. She 
started for the door—and stopped. 

“Your father and I have been working very hard. I know we haven’t been 
paying much attention to you. But that’s going to change now. We’re going to be 
here for you. In fact, we’re going to be watching you very closely.” 

Great. 

Mom and Dad were going to start studying me—like one of their science 
projects. 

“It’s way too chilly in here, Sammy.” Mom walked over to my window and 
closed it. Then she left the room. 

“Are you still here, Brent?” I snapped. 

“Yes.” 

“Why did you do that to me? Why wouldn’t you speak to my mother?” I 
demanded. 

“Sorry,” Brent said. “But I don’t want anyone else to know about me. I just 
want to live with you and be your friend.” 

“Well, that’s not going to happen,” I replied sharply. 

I suddenly felt hopeful. Because Mom had just given me a great idea! 

Now I knew exactly what I had to do—to get rid of the invisible boy. 



21 


I ran straight across the hall to the bathroom. I turned the hot-water faucet in the 
shower up all the way. 

Yes! A few seconds later, the mirror started to cloud with steam. Then I 
turned on the hot water in the sink—and in the bathtub too. 

Wow. Was it hot in here! Hotter than a tropical rain forest, I thought. 

Excellent! 

I wiped the sweat from my forehead and raced back into my room. I made 
sure the window was closed tightly. Then I opened the valve on my radiator. I 
kept turning it—until I heard the loud hiss of steam escape into my room. 

Perspiration dripped from my face as the moist, warm air from the 
bathroom drifted into my room. 

“Sammy, what are you doing?” Brent wailed. “It’s too hot in here!” 

I laughed. “Sorry. But this is the way I like it!” 

I raced down the hall and opened the valve on Mom and Dad’s radiator, 
then Simon’s radiator too. I made sure all their windows were shut tight. 

“Sammy, stop!” Brent begged. “It’s too hot! Too hot!” 

I sat in my bed—and waited. 

Beads of sweat formed on my upper lip. My T-shirt, drenched with sweat, 
clung to me. 

Perfect! 

“I—I can’t take it anymore.” Brent’s voice started to grow faint. “I—I can’t 
stay here. It’s... too... hot.” 

Over his low cries, I heard my window slide up. 

And I knew that my plan had worked. Brent was gone—for good. 



22 


On Saturday night, Roxanne and I had planned to go to the movies to see School 
Spirit. But the plan had changed. Roxanne insisted that if I didn’t go to Hedge 
House with her, she’d never speak to me again. 

I believed her. 

“Can you walk a little faster?” Roxanne asked. “It’s getting cold out here.” 

She was right. A heavy fog had settled in. And a strong wind began to blow. 

I shivered in the damp night air. 

We walked quickly, down block after block. “We’re almost there,” Roxanne 
said as we neared the next corner. “Are you ready?” 

I shrugged. “Sure.” 

“Good.” Roxanne stopped. “We’re here.” 

Whoa! I peered up—at the highest, darkest hedges I had ever seen. A wall 
of hedges so thick you couldn’t even see through it! 

“I—I’ve never seen hedges grow so high before,” I stammered. 

“‘It’s the will of the ghost. To keep the house chilly and dark—as cold and 
icy as the spirit itself.’” Roxanne smiled. “I memorized that part from the book I 
read to you.” 

“How do we get in?” I asked, searching for a way through the tall shmbs. 

“You’re lucky you have me for a partner,” Roxanne sighed. “You don’t 
know anything.” 

We walked along the dark hedges until we came to a small opening. I 
peeked inside—and there stood Hedge House. Three stories high, tall and 
narrow, with lots of windows—most of them shattered. Sharp shards of glass 
poked up from the frames. 

Wow! The hedges did grow as tall as the highest windows—just as the book 
said. The shingles on the outside of the house were blackened and rotted with 
age. 

A strong gust of wind blew. 

The hedge tops beat against the pointed roof—and sent a loose shingle 
hurtling through the air. 

Roxanne and I jumped back—just in time. 

I could see Roxanne shiver. 



This house was really creepy! 

“If you’re scared, we don’t have to go in,” I told her. “We can still go see 
the movie.” 

“Me? Scared? Have you totally lost it?” she snapped. “Let’s go!” 

Roxanne headed up the broken stone steps to the front door. I followed right 
behind her. 

She walked up onto the wooden porch. “Be careful,” she said, glancing 
back at me. “These planks are kind of wobbly.” 

She reached out for the front door. She slowly turned the doorknob. 

The door swung open with a creak—and we stepped inside. 



23 


We stood in a large entrance hall. 

A fancy chandelier hung from the ceiling directly over our heads. Crystals 
in the shape of teardrops dangled from it. Crystals draped in a thick layer of dust 
and cobwebs. 

It felt icy cold in here. Much colder than outside. A sour odor rose up to 
greet us. 

I shivered. I groped for a light switch, and found one on the wall next to the 

door. 

I flicked the switch—but nothing happened. 

“It’s not going to work!” Roxanne whispered. “Nobody has lived here for 
years! Turn on your flashlight.” 

“What flashlight?” I asked. 

“You didn’t bring a flashlight? You were supposed to bring a flashlight,” 
she whispered. 

“I forgot,” I admitted. 

Roxanne sighed. “Did you bring the camcorder?” she demanded. 

“Yes, it’s right here.” I pulled the video camera out of my backpack. 

“At least you remembered something,” she muttered. She started to say 
something else. But instead, a cry escaped her lips. 

“What’s wrong?” I asked. 

“Didn’t you hear something—like a low moan?” she asked, excited. 

“No,” I told her. “I didn’t hear anything.” 

“Oh,” she said. “Well, we just got here. I bet we hear moaning soon. Make 
sure your camcorder is ready.” 

We stepped forward—into the living room. Into a cold white mist. 

“I can’t see a thing,” I whispered. “How did the living room get so foggy?” 

“Look.” Roxanne pointed to one of the walls where the fog came seeping 
through the cracks. It entered in narrow streams, then billowed and swirled, 
filling the room. 

I took another step—and the wind howled outside. 

Something white flew at me. 



I jumped back—then realized it was just the curtains. Filmy, white curtains 
flapping over the broken front windows. Flapping hard. 

Another gust blew. Stronger this time. It drove the streams of fog through 
the cracks. 

“There’s nothing in here,” I said. Another shiver ran through me. “Let’s go 
upstairs.” 

Roxanne led the way through the dining room and kitchen before we 
headed toward the steps. Both rooms were empty. Cold and empty. 

We walked down a long hallway. At the end of the hallway we found the 
staircase. The old, wood banister was badly splintered. Parts of it were missing 
completely. 

“Ready?” Roxanne groped the wall as she started up. 

I whispered “yes,” but I wasn’t so sure. I mean—I really didn’t think this 
house was haunted. But it was so dark, and damp, and foggy, and empty.... 
Anyone would be a little scared in here! 

As we climbed the staircase, the steps groaned under our feet. The air grew 
colder. 

At the top of the stairs we faced three doors. We peered into each doorway. 
Into small, dark rooms. 

I let out a relieved sigh when I saw they were all empty. 

We climbed the stairs to the third floor. It took us into a large room. This 
one wasn’t empty. 

Shredded clothing and torn blankets lay scattered on the floor. Three 
pillows sat propped against a wall—slashed, with the stuffing spilling out. 

A toppled wooden chair leaned against an old trunk. 

Roxanne crossed the darkened room and headed for the trunk. 

I kneeled down and studied a piece of black, crumpled material on the floor. 
I picked it up—and gasped. 

It was a black shirt—a black shirt with the right sleeve missing! Just like in 
the ghost story! 

“Let’s check out the trunk,” Roxanne whispered. 

“No! Look at this—” I started, then stopped—as a frightening moan drifted 
up the steps. 

We spun around to face the staircase—and gasped as the steps began to 
creak and groan. 

Footsteps! 



Roxanne’s mouth gaped open. 

My heart began to pound in my chest. 

Roxanne turned to me, but I peered down quickly so she wouldn’t see how 
frightened I was. 

“The—the ghost—is here,” she stammered. “It’s coming! Get the 
camcorder ready.” 

I fumbled for the power switch. It shook as I raised it up in my trembling 
hands. 

The footsteps reached the top of the stairs. 

Roxanne stood in the center of the room—frozen in fear. 

A deep, eerie moan filled the room. Followed by a shrill laugh. 

Then the chair flew across the room. And the lid of the trunk shot open. 

Roxanne leaped back. She took out her notebook and began scribbling 
notes. She was excited—and scared. Her pencil shook as she wrote. 

The lid of the trunk slammed down hard. We both jumped. 

I watched in horror as the chair began to rise up off the floor. It hovered in 
midair, then came down with a loud crash. 

“Don’t just stand there!” Roxanne screamed at me. “The camcorder! The 
camcorder! Get it on video!” 

I lifted the video camera—and the pillows soared through the room. 

The blankets came alive. They seemed to hurl themselves at us. They 
wrapped around our bodies. 

“Yuck!” I cried out. They smelled so sour, so rotten. 

The blankets spun us around like toy tops. Then they dropped to the floor. 

The trunk lid opened and banged closed—again and again. 

The windows slid up and crashed down. 

“It’s a ghost!” Roxanne exclaimed happily. “A real ghost! Do you believe 
it? We’re definitely going to get an A! Let me have that!” 

She grabbed my video camera. And peered through the viewfinder. 

“Noooooooo!” A terrified howl escaped her throat. She dropped the camera. 
It clattered to the floor. 

“Help me, Sammy!” she screamed. “It’s got me! It’s got me!” 



24 


“Let me go!” Roxanne shrieked. “Sammy—help! It’s got me! The ghost—it’s 
pulling me!” 

I gaped in horror as Roxanne’s jacket flew up behind her, tugged by an 
invisible, ghostly hand. 

Her whole body jerked as the ghost pulled—and sent her stumbling across 
the room. 

She tripped and fell to her knees. 

“Owww!” She uttered a terrified cry. Scrambled to her feet, her eyes wide 
with fright. 

I suddenly remembered the camcorder. I’ve got to get this on tape! I told 
myself. I raised the camera. 

Roxanne’s jacket flew out behind her again. “Ohhh—help!” she cried. 

She began to spin in a circle. Round and round. Faster and faster. Whirling 
helplessly, her arms flying up, her hair spinning out behind her head. 

I tried to hold the camcorder steady, but I couldn’t. 

“Drop that stupid camera—and help me! ” Roxanne shrieked as she whirled 
around the room. 

“Get away from her!” I yelled. “Leave her alone!” 

To my shock, Roxanne stopped spinning. Her knees buckled. She fell 
against the wall. Hit hard with a loud THUD. 

“Oh.” She shook her head as if trying to shake away her fear. “The Ghost of 
Hedge House—” she started. 

But before she could finish her sentence, she floated up from the floor. 

“No—please!” Roxanne begged, thrashing her arms wildly, kicking her 
legs. “LET ME DOWN! LET ME DOWN!” 

The ghost must have let go. Because Roxanne slid to the floor. She landed 
on her knees. 

Before she could climb up, a pillow floated from the floor. I stared in shock 
as it pressed itself over Roxanne’s face. 

She uttered a muffled cry. “Help—I can’t breathe! The ghost—he’s 
smothering me!” 

“Nooooo!” A cry tore from my throat as I dove across the room to 



Roxanne. 

“Nooooo!” With a desperate grab, I ripped the pillow away. “Go haunt 
someone else!” I screamed. 

Roxanne dropped to the floor. 

I tossed the pillow away and started toward her. But a cold hand tightened 
around my arm. “Jeffrey — I’ve been waiting for you,” a hoarse voice rasped. 

The Ghost of Hedge House! 

It talked! It talked to me! 

“I—I’m not Jeffrey!” I choked out. 

“Jeffrey — I’ve been waiting for you!” he moaned again. 

Then I felt myself being lifted off the floor. 

Before I could struggle free, the ghost jerked me back and forth—back and 
forth—so hard I thought my neck would snap. 

I wanted to scream. I wanted to fight back. 

But his grip was so strong. I felt so helpless.... 

A sour-smelling blanket rose up and wrapped itself tightly around me. I 
couldn’t move my hands or legs! 

I kicked and squirmed—struggling against the rotted fabric. And finally 
dropped facedown on the floor. 

A shrill laugh rang through the room. 

Roxanne and I staggered to our feet. We headed for the stairs. 

The ghost followed after us, moaning. “Jeffrey — I’ve been waiting for you. 
Jeffrey—come back! I’ve waited so long!” 

We reached the second-floor landing—and the ghost grabbed me from 
behind. “I’ve got you now, Jef-frey!” came his raspy whisper. “I’ve waited so 
long in this old house. So long...” 

His cold hands circled my neck. 

He tightened his grip. I couldn’t breathe! 

“I’m... not... Jeffrey,” I choked out. 

My last words. 



25 


I thought they were my last words. 

Everything flared bright red. The dark room spun and tilted behind the 
swirling red. 

Stars flashed in my eyes. So white and bright, my head ached. I tried to 
blink them away. 

And they faded to black. Everything faded to black. 

The Ghost of Hedge House had another victim. 

But no. 

Not quite. 

A hand grabbed mine. Pulled me. Pulled me from the darkness. 

“Sammy—come on!” Roxanne pleaded in a terrified whisper. “Come on! 
You’re okay! You’re okay!” 

And before I realized it, she had pulled me free. And we were running 
again. Running down the stairs. Through the misty living room. Out the door. 
And into the cold night. 

Breathing the air. The cool, sweet air. 

Breathing and running. 

Alive! 

Yes! Alive! Leaving the Ghost of Hedge House behind. And running. 
Running and breathing. 

The air never smelled so good. The night never looked so beautiful. 
Roxanne ran straight to her house. I watched her throw open her front door. 
She flew inside and slammed the door behind her. 

I jogged the rest of the way to my house. Burst breathlessly inside. And 
checked the front door twice to make sure it was locked. 

My legs trembling, my whole body vibrating, shaking— alive !—I ran up the 
stairs to my room. 

I sat down on my bed—and screamed in terror. Screamed at the black shirt 
draped on my pillow. 

The black shirt of the one-armed ghost! 



26 


“It’s only a shirt,” a voice said calmly. “What’s your problem?” 

I jumped to my feet—and saw a plate hovering in the air. And a sandwich 
vanishing, bite by bite. 

Brent! 

“Didn’t I do a great job?” Brent asked between bites. “Don’t I make an 
awesome ghost?” 

I saw my desk chair slide out. “That was hard work!” he sighed. “Boy, am I 
tired!” 

“You?” I shrieked. “That was you?” 

“I know. I know. I was awesome,” he said. “Jef-frey —I’ve been waiting for 
you!” Then he burst out laughing. 

“I—I—I—” I sputtered. 

“Don’t thank me,” Brent said. “Really. You don’t have to thank me. Now 
you’ll have the best report in school. I told you I could help you. I told you I 
could be your best friend.” 

“Oh, nooo!” I shouted. “Brent! How could you do that to me? You scared 
me to death! You scared Roxanne to death! You really hurt her! And you nearly 
strangled me!” 

“Don’t thank me,” he repeated. “You really don’t have to. I just wanted to 
show that I can help you.” 

“Get out of my house! Get out—now!” I screamed at him. “I mean it!” 

“GET OUT!” I cried, so loud my voice cracked. “Get out, you idiot! You 
nearly killed us! I want you to leave NOW. Get out!” 

I turned to the door and pointed to it. “Get—” 

Dad stood in the doorway, his face filled with concern. “Sammy, I’m sorry, 
son. But you’re too old to have an imaginary friend,” he said softly. 

“No, Dad. You don’t understand! He’s not my friend!” I cried. “He’s not my 
friend! He’s not!” 

Dad wrapped his arm around my shoulders. “Stay calm. Just try to stay 
calm.” 

He walked me to my bed. He made me sit down. 

He grabbed for my desk chair. 



“Don’t sit there!” I gasped. “He’s sitting there!” 

Dad sat down anyway. “Take a deep breath,” he instructed me. “Settle 
down. Now—let’s talk about this friend of yours.” 

“Dad! He’s not my friend. He wants to be my friend, but he’s not. He’s 
driving me crazy!” 

I shoved the black shirt aside and fell back on my pillow. And suddenly I 
had an idea. “I know! I bet we can get rid of him together! Dad—will you help 
me? Will you help me get rid of Brent?” 

“Of course I’ll help you,” Dad replied, his eyes studying me. He stood up. 
Took my hand. Guided me to the doorway. 

“Thanks, Dad! I really appreciate this. Thanks a lot.” I sighed with relief. 

I suddenly felt much better. As soon as Dad said he’d help, all my muscles 
relaxed. 

“Everything is going to be okay,” Dad said softly. 

“I know,” I replied. “I feel better already.” 

“That’s great, son. But can you tell me—what’s troubling you? Do you 
know? What made you invent this invisible friend—Brent?” 

I let out a loud groan. 

Dad didn’t believe me. He led me downstairs. 

“Where are we going?” I asked. 

He didn’t answer me. 

“Dad!” I cried. “Where are you taking me?” 



27 


“Where are we going, Dad? TELL ME NOW!” 

“Calm down, Sammy. We have an appointment with someone who can help 
you,” he finally answered. “Mom and I have talked about your problem with Dr. 
Krandall—and she’s going to see you now.” 

“I—I don’t want to go to a doctor!” I yelled. “I don’t need a doctor!” 

“Don’t worry.” Dad patted me on the back. “You’ll like talking to the 
doctor. She’s really nice. And very understanding.” 

Dad hurried to the kitchen to get his car keys. 

Dad thinks I’m crazy, I realized. He thinks I’ve totally lost it. 

So does everyone else I know. 

There’s no way I can convince anyone that Brent is real. 

He’s going to live with me forever. 

He’s going to ruin my life forever. 

Someone knocked at the door. I pulled it open. 

“Hi, Sammy.” It was Roxanne. “I had to come over!” she said. “I had to 
talk to you about the ghost! Wasn’t that awesome?” 

“Uh-huh. Really awesome,” I murmured. 

“Well, you don’t sound very excited. What’s the matter with you?” She 
headed into the living room and sat down on the couch. 

“Oh, nothing. Everyone thinks I’m crazy—that’s all.” I sat down beside her. 

Brutus sauntered in and curled up in my lap. 

“Did you tell your parents about the ghost? Is that why they think you’re 
crazy? Don’t worry! I’ll tell them it’s all true,” Roxanne assured me. “I’ll tell 
them we really saw it!” 

“It’s not about the ghost—” 

“Okay, Sammy. Let’s go.” Dad walked into the room, jingling the car keys 
in his hand. 

Mom and Simon followed behind him, both wearing very serious 
expressions. 

“Where are you going?” Roxanne asked. “Can I come too?” 

“No, Roxanne. I don’t think that would be a good idea,” Dad said softly. 



“I’m taking Sammy to a doctor. He’s been seeing things.” 

“But everything is going to be okay,” Mom chimed in. She gazed at me 
with a strange smile on her face. “Doctors know how to deal with these things.” 

“You don’t have to take Sammy to a doctor,” Roxanne started. “The ghost 

“Is your invisible friend a ghost? You didn’t tell me that part,” Mom said. 

“Your invisible friend?” Roxanne’s eyebrows shot up. “He’s still in your 
room?” 

“Wait, Dad—don’t take Sammy to the doctor!” Simon exclaimed. 

Whoa. I couldn’t believe this one. Simon was actually sticking up for me. 

“Don’t take him tonight,” Simon added. “Take him tomorrow. He’ll still be 
crazy tomorrow. I want you to help me with my science project tonight. I’m not 
growing fast enough. I want you to help me come up with a new topic.” 

“It will have to wait, Simon. Your brother needs help,” Dad said sternly. 
“Come on, Sammy. Let’s go.” 

“I am not going to a doctor!” I shouted. “Wait. What if I prove that Brent is 
real?” 

I didn’t give them a chance to answer. I had a plan. A really good plan. If it 
worked, they’d believe me. They’d have to believe me. 

I charged down to the basement. And searched Dad’s workbench. 

Where is it? Where is it? I searched frantically. It’s got to be here 
somewhere! 

I cleared the benchtop with a swipe of my hand. Everything clattered to the 
floor. But I found it! 

The Molecule Detector Light. 

I charged back upstairs. “This light lets you see invisible things, right?” I 
waved the light in Dad’s face. “So if I shine it on Brent, we’ll ah be able to see 
him! Right, Dad? Right?” 

“Maybe,” Dad replied doubtfully. “But, Sammy—” 

I ran to the stairs. Everyone followed me. 

Will it work? I wondered. Will it? 



28 


“Where are you, Brent? I know you’re here.” 

Everyone crowded into my room. 

They watched me as I slowly turned in a circle, searching for a clue. 
Searching for something that would tell me where Brent was. 

“Brent!” I called his name. 

He didn’t answer me. 

I turned on the detector light. 

I swept it through the room. 

No sign of Brent anywhere. 

“Sammy, this is silly,” Mom said. She turned to Dad for support, but Dad 
just shrugged his shoulders. 

I kneeled down and swept the light under my bed. 

No Brent. 

“Please put the light down,” Mom pleaded. “We’re wasting time. We have 
an appointment with the doctor.” 

I ignored her. 

“Where are you, Brent? I know you’re here!” I said. “Tell us where you are 
—now!” 

And then, finally, Brent spoke up. “Please. Please don’t do it, Sammy. 
Please—I don’t want you to see me.” 

Mom, Dad, Simon, and Roxanne gasped. 

“See!” I cried. “I told you! I told you he was here! I told you I’m not 
crazy!” 

I swept the light over my desk chair. Onto my bed. In front of my dresser. 
But Brent wasn’t any of those places. 

“Where are you, Brent? It’s okay. You can tell me. I have to show them.” 
“Please. NO!” Brent cried. “I don’t want you to!” 

I jerked open the closet door. 

I shined the light inside—and I saw him! 

“NO! I don’t believe it!” I gasped. “You’re—you’re a MONSTER!” 



29 


“You’re a MONSTER!” I cried again. 

The Molecule Detector Light shook in my trembling hand. I forced myself 
to hold the bright beam steady. 

“That’s why my parents made me invisible,” Brent said softly. “They 
thought I might survive if you couldn’t see me.” 

With my light still focused on him, Brent stepped toward me. 

I leaped back. “What are you going to do?” 

“Whoa—he is so UGLY!” Simon groaned. “Yuck! He has only one head!” 

“And look. He has only two arms—and they’re so short!” Roxanne cried. 
“He can’t wrap his arms around and around himself. How does he keep himself 
warm?” 

“And what’s that dark stuff growing on top of his head?” Simon pointed. 
“Why doesn’t he have tendrils and suction pods like we do? Where are his 
antennae? And how can he see with only two eyes?” 

“Calm down, everyone,” Dad instructed. “You’re not going to harm us—are 
you, Brent?” 

“No. Of course not,” Brent replied. “I just want to be Sammy’s friend.” 

“No! Be my friend!” Simon cried. “I need you for my science project!” 

Simon turned to Dad. “Can I have him, Dad? PLEASE! Can I have him for 
my science project? I really need him!” 

“That wouldn’t be fair,” Roxanne replied. “Sammy found him first!” 

“Everyone—quiet!” Mom ordered. “Brent—I’ve seen pictures of your 
species in a textbook. Hmm... let me see... what are you called?” 

“I’m called a human,” Brent answered shyly. 

“That’s right!” Mom snapped her fingers. “Now I remember. Human.” 

“Yuck,” Roxanne muttered, making a disgusted face. 

“I know I’m ugly,” Brent said sadly. “That’s why I didn’t want you to see 
me...” His voice trailed off. 

I stared at Brent in disbelief. A human. I’d never heard of one before. 

I tore my five eyes away from him and turned to Dad. “I know he’s ugly, 
Dad. But I think I’d like to keep him,” I said. “Can I? I’ll take good care of him. 
I promise!” 



“No. I don’t think so, Sammy.” Dad studied Brent for a moment. “I think 
we’d better take Brent to the zoo.” 

“Huh? The zoo?” I cried. “Why, Dad? Why does he have to live in a zoo?” 
“Well, he’ll get much better care there,” Dad answered. “After all, humans 
are an endangered species!” 





DEEP TROUBLE II 


Goosebumps - 58 
R.L. Stine 



1 


I’m back. 

That’s what I thought when I arrived on the Cassandra for another summer 
vacation. 

Yes, I, William Deep, Jr., world-famous undersea explorer, am back. 

One year older. One year wiser. One year tougher. 

I breathed in a big gulp of salty air. I gazed at the clear green Caribbean sea 
around me. 

My little sister, Sheena, stood beside me. But I pretended she wasn’t there. 

She sort of ruined the atmosphere for me. She usually does. 

The Cassandra is my uncle’s boat. It’s a floating research lab. 

My uncle, Dr. George Deep, is a marine biologist. My parents sent me and 
Sheena to visit him on our summer vacation. They sent us the year before too. 

Dr. D. lives on the boat in the Caribbean all year long, studying tropical 
fish. It’s fun for us. We get to swim and stuff. My uncle is really nice. And my 
parents figure we’ll learn a lot about science and ocean life while we’re with 
him. 

Last summer I made one of the most shocking discoveries in the history of 
marine biology. 

I found a mermaid. A real mermaid. 

No one believed me, of course. I wasn’t a grownup scientist. I was a 
twelve-year-old boy on vacation in the Caribbean. 

Know-it-all Sheena thought I was lying. 

My uncle, Dr. D., thought I was making it up. He didn’t believe in 
mermaids. 

Until I proved him wrong. 

We didn’t tell anyone about the mermaids. Some really bad guys wanted to 
capture them and put them in cages. To protect the mermaids, Sheena, Dr. D., 
and I agreed to keep them a secret. 

So the world will never know... 

And now, I’m back! I told myself. Billy Deep, one of the greatest explorers 
in the seven seas. 



And I’m not a twelve-year-old kid anymore. 

I’m thirteen. 

And this summer, I’m going to find something big. Something even more 
amazing than a mermaid. 

This time, the world will hear about it. This time I’ll be famous. 

I hope. 


* * * 


The fire coral glowed bright red. I snorkeled near it, careful not to touch it. 

I’d stepped on fire coral once before. It burned my foot like crazy. 

They don’t call it fire coral for nothing. 

I studied the coral wall. Neon-bright fish darted in and out of the delicate 
holes. It was beautiful. There, under the water, everything seemed calm. Quiet. 
Peaceful. 

But I knew better. I was an experienced snorkeler. A snorkeling hero. 

An untrained swimmer wouldn’t have noticed it. That little ripple in the 
water. The way the fish all suddenly disappeared. 

But I felt it. That whiff of danger. 

Something was coming. Something deadly. 



2 


I whirled around—and faced the intruder. 

A giant octopus! 

“WHOOOA!” The snorkel flew from my mouth as I cried out in shock. An 
octopus! It rose up in the water, its purple body as big as mine ! 

I shoved the mouthpiece back into my mouth. And frantically tried to thrash 
away from it. 

But before I could get moving, I felt something cold and soft wrap around 
my throat. 

Ohhhh. 

A tentacle as thick as a human arm. 

Its suction pods snapped to my skin. It started to pull me... pull me down. 

No! 

Gasping for breath, I lifted my head out of the water. And let out a choked 
cry for help. 

I felt another cold tentacle slide around my waist. And then another around 
my chest. 

I thrashed and kicked. But the huge creature was too powerful. The big 
suction pods made loud sucking sounds as they tightened against my skin. 

The tentacles pulled me... pulled me... 

Until everything went black. 

No! No! 

I wasn’t losing consciousness. The blackness that washed around me was 
octopus ink. 

I shut my eyes. Twisted and squirmed. 

But the tentacles pulled harder. Pulled me down into the inky blackness. 

I choked and sputtered. And struggled up to the surface. 

The water tossed and churned, black with octopus ink. 

The big suction pods bit into my bare skin. 

The tentacles tightened... tightened around my ribs, my stomach. 

I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t move. 

I’m going under, I realized. I’m doomed. Doomed! 



My lungs felt about to explode. 

No! I thought. I can’t die! Not like this! 

There must be a way to make the octopus let go. 

With a last burst of strength, I slid my right arm free. 

Now what? Now what? 

I stretched a finger toward its throbbing, purple belly. 

Red and yellow stars flashed before my eyes. I knew I had little time. I was 
about to pass out any second. 

I reached toward the big throbbing body. With my last bit of strength, I 
wriggled my fingers. Please let this work, I prayed. Please... Then I started 
tickling. 



3 


My fingers tickled the purple belly. 

Tickle, tickle! 

The octopus squirmed. 

Tickle, tickle! 

The tentacles relaxed. 

Yes! Yes! It’s working! The octopus was ticklish! 

Its big body heaved—and it shoved me away. 

“Stop it, Billy!” the octopus whined. “I hate your stupid jokes. Stop tickling 

me!” 

Then the octopus pinched me. 

Okay, okay. So it wasn’t an octopus. It was my little sister, Sheena. 

Sheena always spoils my fun. She has no imagination. She hates to pretend. 
Well... it’s true that she doesn’t look much like an octopus. She looks a lot 
like me, actually. Skinny, with straight black hair. Hers is long, and mine is short. 
We both have dark blue eyes and bushy dark eyebrows. 

She’s younger than I am. She’s only eleven. But she acts like an old lady 
sometimes. She hates games. She likes cold, hard facts. 

“What were you pretending this time?” Sheena teased. “That you were a 
tickle-fish?” 

“None of your business,” I answered. She would never admit that I was a 
great undersea explorer. Had she forgotten about the mermaids? 

It didn’t matter. Other little sisters look up to their big brothers. Not Sheena. 
If I told her I was pretending she was an octopus, she’d never stop teasing 
me. 

“You’re a moron, Billy,” she groaned. 

Do you believe she calls a great undersea explorer a moron ? 

“I’ll show you,” I replied lamely. 

I love to play tricks on Sheena. It isn’t easy to fool her. 

But I had an idea. I thought of a mean trick to play on her that would scare 
her—but good. 

I swam back to the boat. 



I flipped my mask up and climbed aboard the Cassandra. It was a big, 
sturdy boat, about fifty feet long, with a large open deck. Below deck were 
research labs, a galley, and a few cabins for sleeping. 

The white deck steamed in the sun, deserted. It was about noon. 

Dr. D. must be down below, I realized. Perfect. 

I didn’t want him to see me and blow my trick. 

I reached under a stack of life jackets. I pulled out a square, gray vinyl 
pillow I’d hidden there. 

I stared out toward the reef. Sheena was busy snorkeling. She wasn’t 
looking. 

Good. 

Here was my plan: I was going to swim underwater, holding the gray pillow 
over my head. I’d hold it so one of the corners pointed up. You guessed it. Like a 
shark’s fin. 

Then I’d swim at Sheena as fast as I could. She’d think a shark was headed 
straight for her! 

It would scare her to death. I couldn’t wait to hear her screaming to me for 

help. 

“We’ll see who’s a moron,” I murmured to myself. 

I slipped back into the water. Holding the pillow in sharkfin position, I 
started kicking. I swam underwater toward the reef. Toward Sheena. 

After a few minutes, I bobbed up for breath. She hadn’t seen me yet. 

Holding the “sharkfin” high, I paddled closer. Closer. 

Then I heard them. At last. The screams. 

“Shark!” Sheena wailed. “Help! A shark!” 

Ha! Ha! Excellent screaming, Sheena! 

I finally fooled Miss Know-It-All! 

“Shaaark!” she wailed again. 

I couldn’t stay underwater any longer. I had to rise up so I could laugh in 
her face. 

I popped my head above the water. 

Hey! Sheena was swimming frantically toward the boat. She was still 
screaming like crazy. 

But she wasn’t looking in my direction. She hadn’t even seen me. 

“Shark!” she cried again. She made a frightened motion toward the reef. 

I saw it too. A huge sharkfin! A real one! 



4 


“Huh?” I let out a terrified gasp. 

The shark was as big as a whale ! 

Where did it come from? Dr. D. had told us there were no large sharks in 
the area. 

I guess no one told the shark! 

It rose up, tossed by a wave. And I gaped at its silvery-white body—as long 
as a canoe! 

It snapped its massive jaws. The CRAACK echoed over the water. 

“Whooooa!” I let go of the pillow and paddled for the boat as fast as I 
could. My heart raced. The water felt as thick as mud. Why couldn’t I swim 
faster? 

“Hurry, Billy!” Sheena called. I glanced back. 

The gigantic gray fin cut through the water like a powerboat. 

The shark sped straight for us. 

“Swim!” I ordered myself. “Faster! Faster!” 

Sheena and I thrashed toward the boat. I didn’t glance back again. I didn’t 
want to see how close the big shark was! 

Gasping, my entire body aching, I reached the Cassandra. I grabbed the 
side. Almost safe. Almost. 

Sheena scrambled up the ladder ahead of me. 

“Hurry!” I shouted. I clutched the ladder and glanced back. 

The shark roared closer. So close, I could see its glassy black eyes. And its 
mouth full of jagged teeth. 

“Sheena, go!” I screamed. I shoved her up onto the deck and scrambled up 
the ladder. 

“We made it!” Sheena gasped. 

Gasping for breath, my chest heaving, I stared over the rail. 

The shark kept coming! Like a submarine with teeth! 

“NOOOO!” 

I let out a hoarse wail as the huge fish slammed into the side of the boat! 

“NOOOOOO!” 



The whole boat rocked—and tilted. 

I grabbed the rail and held on. 

“Hold on, Sheena!” I shouted. “It’s attacking!” 

I braced myself for another jolt. 

Nothing happened. 

The shark disappeared into the churning water. 

Dr. D. appeared on deck, looking confused. “What’s going on?” he cried. 

Sheena and I ran to him, screaming, “A shark! A shark!” 

“What?” Dr. D. stared out to sea. 

The water gleamed calmly now. Soft waves splashed against the side of the 

boat. 

The monster shark had vanished. 

“Billy—there is nothing out there. What are you talking about?” Dr. D. 
demanded. 

“There was a shark! A huge shark! It chased us,” Sheena cried breathlessly. 
“It crashed into the boat!” 

“A shark?” Dr. D. shook his head. “No way. No way a shark could make the 
boat rock like that.” 

“But it was HUGE!” I screamed. “It was as big as ten sharks!” 

“As big as twenty sharks!” Sheena exclaimed. 

Dr. D. rubbed his bald spot. “I told you two before. I checked the radar. I 
checked out all of my sonic surveyors. There are no large sharks in this area.” 

He stared me in the eye and asked, “Are you sure, Billy? Are you sure you 
saw a shark?” 

“We’re sure!” Sheena insisted. We both knew he’d believe her before he’d 
believe me. 

“Come down to the lab with me, kids,” Dr. D. said. 

We followed him below deck to one of the labs. Dr. D. pointed to a large 
tank in the corner. It held a silvery fish the size of a big dog. 

Sheena gasped. “Wow! I’ve never seen a fish like that before!” 

“Neither have I,” Dr. D. said solemnly. “That’s what bothers me.” 

I stared at the fish as it swam around in the tank. It looked sort of familiar, 
but I didn’t know why. 

“I can’t identify it,” Dr. D. went on. “I’ve never seen a fish this size that 
looks like this. I’ve been searching through all my books, but I can’t find it!” 

He pointed to a stack of books on marine biology. I picked one up and 



flipped through it. It had page after page of cool color photos of all kinds of fish. 

Dr. D. glanced over my shoulder as I examined the book. “It can’t be in that 
section, Billy,” he told me. “All those fish are tiny.” 

I turned a page, looking for the big fish section. Then I turned another page 
—and gasped. 

Dr. D. gripped my shoulder as he stared down at the photo with me. “No!” 
he cried. “It can’t be!” 



5 


We crowded around the book, staring at the photo. It showed a fish exactly like 
the one in the tank. Thin, silvery... but there was one huge difference. 

“It’s a minnow!” Dr. D. exclaimed. “But that’s impossible!” 

I read the words under the picture. “Tropical minnow, one inch long.’” 

I glanced at the fish in the tank. It was more like four feet long! 

Dr. D.’s eyes narrowed as he studied the fish. “How could a minnow get so 
huge?” he wondered out loud. “I must examine it more closely.” 

Sheena and I stood behind him, watching. He studied the picture of the 
minnow through a magnifying glass. Then he turned to the giant minnow, staring 
at its scales, checking every mark. 

“The markings are exactly the same,” Dr. D. murmured. 

“Can I look through the magnifying glass?” Sheena asked. 

“Sure.” Dr. D. passed the glass to her. 

“A minnow...” Dr. D. murmured. “How can this giant fish be a minnow? 
It’s supposed to be as small as your goldfish, Billy.” 

My goldfish! “Whoops,” I cried. “I forgot to feed my goldfish this 
morning.” 

“Better go do it,” Dr. D. said. 

I started toward the lab door. On my way, I spotted a cabinet filled with 
glass bottles. “What’s in these, Dr. D.?” I asked. 

He turned away from the monster minnow to look. “Oh, that’s plankton,” 
he replied. “It’s made of tiny little plants and animals that clump together and 
float around in the water. Lots of fish eat it. I gathered these samples from the 
waters around here.” 

I picked up a bottle. All I could see was murky brown water with greenish- 
brown gunk floating on top. 

Sheena turned the magnifying glass on the plankton. “Gross,” she said. 

“Go ahead and take a bottle, Billy,” Dr. D. suggested. “Feed some to your 
goldfish. They’ll love it.” 

“Thanks, Dr. D.” Clutching the bottle, I headed down the passageway to my 
cabin. 

As I pushed open the door, I said, “Hello, little fish faces. I’ve got a 



delicious surprise for you!” 

But the fish had a bigger surprise for me. Way bigger. 

I stared at the fishbowl. And nearly dropped the bottle of plankton. 
Then I screamed, “NO!” 

I burst out of my cabin. “Help! Help! Dr. D.!” I cried. 

“There’s a head— someone’s head —in my fishbowl!”

Dr. D. and Sheena hurried out of the lab. I glanced back at my cabin door, and 
— oof !—slammed right into Sheena. 

“Ow!” she whined. “Watch it, Billy!” 

“Billy, what’s wrong?” asked Dr. D. 

“Ahead!” I gasped, pointing frantically to my cabin. 

I struggled to breathe. My stomach lurched. “Oh, wow. Oh, wow. There— 
there’s a human head in my fishbowl!” 

Dr. D. frowned and charged into my room. Sheena and I followed. 

He pushed open the door... and stopped short with a gasp. 

“See!” I shouted. 

The head stared at us, eyes open, through the glass. 

How could Dr. D. and Sheena stand to look at it? It was making me sick. I 
gulped and turned away. 

Sheena giggled. 

Giggled? 

“What’s the matter with you, Sheena?” I demanded. “What’s so funny?” 

She crossed the room and reached into the fishbowl. 

“Sheena, no!” I warned. “Don’t touch it!” 

Sheena laughed—and lifted the head out by the hair. Then she waved the 
head, dripping with water. 

“Oh, nooooo!” I groaned. I stared at the head in horror. 

I could see it clearly now. I could see that it wasn’t a human head after all. 

It was a large doll’s head. 

“Got you back!” Sheena taunted. “Got you back for all the tricks you’ve 
been playing on me all summer!” 

Dr. D. grinned. “You almost fooled me too,” he confessed. “The water in 
the fishbowl made the doll’s head look bigger than it really is. Good one, 
Sheena.” 

“Thanks, Dr. D.” Sheena took a little bow. 

My face felt hot. I knew I was blushing. I was so embarrassed. It just isn’t 
like me to fall for such a stupid joke! 



Besides, I’m supposed to be the joker. Not Sheena. 

I stared into the tank. Something was missing. 

“Hey!” I said. “Where are my goldfish? And where’s my snail?” 

Sheena shrugged. I grabbed her by the neck. “What did you do with them?” 

“Okay, okay, don’t worry,” she said. She pushed me away. “I put them in a 
smaller bowl and left them in the bathroom.” 

“Well, get them!” I insisted. I was really angry. 

“I’m going, I’m going,” Sheena said. She brought my fish and my snail 
back, and I gently returned them to their bowl. 

“Don’t ever touch them again!” I told my sister. “I don’t want anything to 
happen to them.” 

I watched the fish swim around for a minute. They didn’t look right. I 
shook my head. “Something’s the matter with them,” I said. 

“Give them a little plankton, Billy,” Dr. D. suggested. “That ought to perk 
them right up.” 

I grabbed the glass bottle and pulled off the stopper. I poured a little of the 
slimy gunk into the bowl. 

The fish darted to the surface and started eating. They looked much happier. 

“Wow,” I said. “They love it!” 

“I thought they would.” Dr. D. smiled, but his eyes clouded over with 
worry. “Now, kids, no more jokes, please. I’m going back to the lab to examine 
that giant minnow. And I don’t want to be disturbed.” 

“We’ll be quiet,” Sheena promised. 

Dr. D. hardly seemed to hear her. “There’s something strange going on 
here,” he murmured. “Something very, very strange...” 

Little did we know that things were about to get much stranger.

I paced the deck, thinking hard. I was dying to get Sheena back for that stupid 
doll trick. 

She seemed nervous the rest of the afternoon. Waiting for me to strike. 

But I hadn’t thought of anything good enough. I’d spent all night thinking, 
until I fell asleep. 

Now it was the next day. Sheena’s guard was down. Maybe she’d forgotten 
—forgotten that she’d been the last one to play a trick on me. 

And now it was her turn to be fooled. 

What would make her hair stand on end? I wondered. What would scare her 
so much, she’d scream her head off? 

The shark trick with the pillow had backfired. So I really owed her two 
tricks. 

Maybe I could leave something gross in her bed? 

The morning sun beat down on me. Summer days were hot in the 
Caribbean. I started to get a headache. 

But I finally thought of something good to do to Sheena. 

I grabbed my snorkeling gear and pulled it on. I decided to sneak off and 
explore a little. 

Dr. D. wanted us to stay close to the boat. But he didn’t want to be 
disturbed. So snorkeling seemed like a good idea. 

Mask and snorkel in place, I started down the boat ladder. 

“Caught you!” 

Sheena’s squeaky voice pierced my eardrums. She was always catching me 
doing something. 

“Where are you going?” she demanded. “Dr. D. said to stay close.” 

“I won’t go far,” I insisted. “I’m hot and I’m bored. I can’t sit on deck 
another second.” 

“Then I’m coming with you.” She snatched up her gear and started tugging 

it on. 

I dropped off the ladder and into the water. She slipped in beside me. 

“We shouldn’t be doing this,” she whispered. “What if that shark comes 
back?” 



“The shark is gone,” I said. “Don’t worry. Nothing bad will happen.” 
“Promise?” she asked, pulling down her mask. 

“Yeah. Sure. I promise,” I said. 

It was a peaceful, sunny day. The waves were as gentle as a lake. What 
could happen? 

Sheena and I swam out over the sunlit, gleaming water. We thought we’d 
see lots of pretty little fish. 

We found something else. Something we never expected in a million years. 



8 


I dunked Sheena’s head under the water. When she popped back up for air, I 
shouted, “Shark! Shark!” 

Sheena clonked me on the head with her fist. “Don’t even joke about it, 
Billy.” Still, I caught her glancing around nervously. 

I scanned the horizon too. No signs of a fin anywhere. 

A school of lemon-yellow fish drifted by, glowing like little suns in the 
water. Swimming slowly, I followed them to the coral reef. 

Wow, I thought. The coral made a cool shape at that spot. The fish swam 
through a big pink ring of coral and around a pointy coral peak. 

Sunlight filtered down on it through the water. It looked like the tower of a 
magic sand castle. 

A tiny crab popped out of one of the holes in the coral tower. It saw me 
coming and disappeared. 

The yellow fish suddenly rose to the surface, up to a plankton bed that 
floated on top of the water. 

The plankton looked just like the stuff Dr. D. kept in those bottles in his lab. 

I watched the fish nip at the plankton, just as my goldfish did. 

I surfaced and spit my snorkel out. 

“Sheena, check this out,” I called. 

No answer. 

“Sheena?” 

I saw a splash on the other side of the reef. Another splash. 

I glimpsed Sheena’s flippers as they slapped the water. 

I swam after her. She had her head down, snorkeling. She must have been 
watching something very closely. She swam fast, kicking her fins in a rapid, 
steady rhythm. 

“Sheena!” I called again. She couldn’t hear me. 

She wouldn’t hear me if I swam up beside her and screamed. She’s like that 
sometimes. Like when she does her homework. She gets so into it, she blocks 
everything else out. 

Of course she gets straight A’s. My mom and dad are constantly bragging 
about it. 



I sighed and paddled after her. I had to go get her. She was swimming out to 
sea without even realizing it. 

I watched her through my mask as I swam. What was that up ahead of her? 
A patch of cloudy water? 

Whoa. No. Not water. I’d never seen anything like it before. 

Sheena didn’t seem to see it. She was swimming steadily, straight for it. 
And, to my horror, it began to move! 

I blew water from my snorkel tube and squinted hard through my mask. 
The thing drifted closer. It was pink and rubbery. Like a soft blob of bubblegum. 
It billowed toward Sheena. 

And as I stared at it, it appeared to stretch. 

It billowed and stretched, billowed out like a pink parachute. Until it was 
bigger than Sheena. 

What is that thing? I wondered. Sheena, turn around! Didn’t she see it? 
Didn’t she see it expanding, curling out, stretching in front of her? 

“Sheena! Turn around! Turn around!” 

I wanted to shout. But I couldn’t shout underwater. 

I thrashed hard. Kicked. Spun around. Desperate to get her attention. 

Sheena!—turn around! I thought. Get away from that thing! Get away— 

now! 

But she kept her head down. And swam straight into the billowy pink blob. 
And as I stared on helplessly, it wrapped itself around her. Like an 
enormous pink clam, it opened wide... wider... and slipped itself around her. 
Held her. Held her tight. Pulled her inside. 

And swallowed her. 



9 


For a moment, I froze in terror. 

Then I pulled myself to the surface. Tossed off the mask. And started to 
swim toward her. 

I splashed across the water, racing toward the pink blob. It writhed and 
wriggled with my sister inside it. 

What is it? I wondered. What can it be? 

And then, as I pulled myself closer, I knew what it was. 

I was staring at a jellyfish! 

A jellyfish bigger than a human. 

Whoa! 

I could see through it. I saw the white, filmy slime and the red veins that 
made it look pink. 

And Sheena—trapped inside! 

Poor Sheena. Squirming. Kicking. Slapping at the gooey pink sides of the 
creature. 

Her face pushed up against the veiny jellyfish skin! Through her mask, I 
saw her eyes wide with terror. 

The ugly creature wrapped around her like a slimy blanket, covering her 
whole body. 

She pushed both fists against the filmy, pink curtain. 

I knew she didn’t have much air left in her lungs. 

I had to do something. But what? 

Sheena’s face twisted in panic. 

I’ll have to pry it open somehow, I decided. 

I swam up to the wriggling blob. I tried to grab its side. 

Ugh! My hands slid right off. 

I grabbed for it again. No way. I couldn’t get a grip on it. It was like 
squeezing Jell-O. 

Its skin slapped against me, so slimy and sticky. 

Sheena stared out at me, eyes bulging with terror. 

I tried to wrestle the ugly creature. I dug my fingernails into it. 



It wriggled and throbbed. But it didn’t open. 

Then I realized what I had to do. 

The thought made me want to puke. But I knew I had no other choice. 
Sheena couldn’t hold out much longer. 

I had to slide inside the jellyfish myself. I had to get in there somehow and 
pull Sheena out. 

I swallowed. 

My stomach lurched. 

I lowered my head and dove for the seam, the opening where the disgusting 
pink blob had folded itself in half. 

Here goes! I told myself. 

I’m going inside.... 



10 


I worked my hands inside first. Then I lowered my head and pulled myself in. 
The slime oozed across my face. The red veins rubbed my skin raw. 

I held my breath and worked my way toward Sheena’s feet. If I could make 
it halfway in and grab her feet, maybe I could yank her out. 

The blob pulsed, sucking me deep inside. I inched in, stretching toward 
Sheena’s foot. 

My lungs were ready to burst. I couldn’t hold my breath much longer. 
Closer, closer... 

Aha! My fingers closed around Sheena’s flipper! 

I tugged. Hard. 

Harder. 

She started to move. 

No. 

Oh, no! 

Sheena’s flipper. It came off in my hand. 

I let go of the flipper and reached up a little higher. I grabbed her foot. And 
tugged. 

Sheena slipped down a little. 

I yanked on her foot again. Come on! I thought. Move! 

But this time Sheena didn’t budge. 

The sticky pink skin tightened around us. My insides felt as if they were 
about to explode! 

The jellyfish squeezed us tighter and tighter. 

It was squeezing us to death! 



11 


I couldn’t move. My mind raced. 

How can I get out of here? How? 

There was no way. We were doomed! 

I’m going to black out, I realized. Another second without air, and... 
Suddenly, the jellyfish loosened its grip. With a horrible sucking noise, it 
peeled apart. 

It opened! 

I didn’t waste time. I grabbed Sheena and hauled her up. Up, up, to the 
surface. 

We burst out of the water, gasping for air. 

We made it! 

I sucked in a huge gulp of air. Aahh. It was great to breathe again. 

The blue faded from Sheena’s face as the color came back to her cheeks. 
“Are you okay?” I asked her. 

She nodded, still struggling to catch her breath. 

“You sure? Can you talk?” 

She nodded again. “Yes, Billy. I’m just great. I’ve never been better.” 

I knew she was fine. Her old smart-mouth was working perfectly. 

“What happened?” I cried. “Why did the jellyfish let us go?” 

Sheena shrugged. We peered down through the clear water. 

The jellyfish floated a few feet below us. And as we stared down at it, we 
saw why it forgot about us. 

We saw another enormous pink shape slither and slide toward the first one. 
It stretched out in the water as if spreading its wings. 

And then it tried to wrap the other jellyfish inside it. 

The two ugly creatures slapped together. The collision sent up a wave that 
tossed Sheena and me back. 

When I gazed down again, they were wrestling. Folding into each other. 
Slapping and twisting. Struggling to fold the other inside. To swallow it whole. 
Another sticky slap. Another. 

As they struggled, the water churned and swirled. 



The jellyfish monsters broke apart and slammed into each other again. 
Huge waves churned up around us. 

“We’ve got to get back to the boat!” I yelled. 

A wave slapped the side of my head. I choked and spit out a mouthful of 
seawater. 

We struggled to swim against the waves, but they kept knocking us down 
and pulling us out to sea. 

The water was so white and foamy, we couldn’t see the jellyfish fight 
anymore. But we could feel them. 

Another wave crashed down on us. I glanced around. “Sheena!” 

She was gone! 

I frantically searched through the foam. “Sheena!” 

Had she gone under? 

CRASH! Another wave. 

“Sheena, where are you?” I wailed. 

She popped up at last, sputtering and choking. I grabbed her and battled 
against the waves. I fought my way out of the wake of the jellyfish fight. 

A few seconds later, Sheena and I dragged ourselves aboard the Cassandra. 
“That was so weird,” Sheena said after we both had caught our breaths. 
“Those jellyfish—they were as big as cars!” 

“We’ve got to tell Dr. D. about this—right away!” I exclaimed. 

We ran down to the lab. No sign of Dr. D. there. 

“Dr. D.!” I called. “Where are you?” 

“I’ll check the galley,” Sheena said. 

I hurried to see if my uncle was in his cabin. No. The tiny room stood 
empty. 

“He’s not in the galley!” Sheena cried. “I don’t see him anywhere!” 

“Dr. D.!” I shouted. “Dr. D.!” 

No reply. 

Sheena’s chin quivered. I knew she was scared. 

It was impossible. But true. 

“He-he’s gone!” I cried. 



12 


A pang ripped through my stomach. Dr. D. had just—vanished! 

Sheena and I were alone in the middle of the sea! 

“What are we going to do?” I asked softly. 

“Don’t panic,” Sheena said. But her voice shook. “Think. Where could he 
go? Know what? Maybe he just went for a swim.” 

“A swim? A swim?” I cried, my voice rising. “We probably would have 
seen him! Besides, since when does Dr. D. just go for a swim? Never!” 

“Well—there’s always a first time,” Sheena suggested. Her eyes darted 
around nervously. I could see her thinking, trying to stay calm. 

“Maybe he went out in the dinghy,” she suggested. Dr. D. kept a small boat 
on deck for short trips. “Let’s see if it’s gone. Maybe he went out to look for us.” 

“Good idea.” At least it was something. A little hope to cling to. 

We hurried up to the deck. I crossed my fingers, hoping to find the dinghy 
gone. 

If the little boat was gone, that meant Dr. D. was probably okay. He’d be 
back soon. 

But if the dinghy was still tied to the deck, and Dr. D. wasn’t on the 
Cassandra ... 

Then what? 

I raced to the back deck and around to the right— 

“Oh, no.” I sighed. 

The dinghy sat in its usual spot. Dr. D. hadn’t taken it out. 

“Billy, I’m scared,” Sheena whispered. 

I was scared too, but I didn’t want to admit it. Not yet, anyway. 

“Let’s check every cabin again,” I suggested. “Maybe he’s in the bathroom 
or something. Maybe he didn’t hear us calling him.” 

Sheena followed me down the stairs that led below-deck. Halfway down, 
the railing rattled in my hand. 

“Cut it out, Sheena,” I snapped. 

“Cut what out?” she cried. 

Now the whole stairway shook. 



What was she doing? Jumping up and down? 

I turned around to check. She stood perfectly still. 
“See! I’m not doing anything!” 

The boat shook and tilted. 

I clutched the rail to keep from falling over. 
“What’s happening?” I cried. 



13 


“It’s an earthquake!” Sheena shrieked. 

“How can it be an earthquake?” I told her. “We’re on the water— 
remember?” 

We ran down the steps. The boat tilted, and we both banged hard into the 
cabin wall. 

We passed the lab. The bottles of plankton rattled in the cabinet. Everything 
rattled. I heard glasses breaking in the galley. 

I turned down the passage to my cabin—but I couldn’t get by. Something 
blocked my path. 

Something... 

“YAAAIIII!” A scream escaped my throat before I could stop it. 

“What is that thing?” I cried. 

Sheena caught up to me. “Huh? What thing?” 

And then she saw it too. It was hard to miss! 

“A monster!” 

A big creature blocked the passage. It was shiny and black and smooth. And 
almost perfectly round. It sat in a disgusting puddle of thick white slime. 

I’d never seen anything like it before. 

Except—something about it looked familiar. 

“What is it?” Sheena choked out. 

The monster stirred. It shook. 

And then its head poked out. Long, dripping, and gray—like an enormous 
slug. With two antennas sticking out of the top. 

“Billy”—Sheena grabbed my sleeve—“It’s—I think it’s a snail!” 

“You’re right,” I muttered in shock. “It is a snail. A gigantic, monster 
snail!” 

“How did it get on the boat?” Sheena demanded. 

“How did it grow so big?” I added. “It’s blocking the entire passage!” 

Slowly, slowly, the snail lifted its slimy head. It trained its big, sad, watery 
eyes on us—and moaned. 

“Help me! Help me!” it cried. 



14 


“YAAIIII!” Sheena screamed, and clutched my hand. 

I screamed back. “It’s talking!” 

“Kids! Help!” the snail moaned again. 

“Nooooooo! It’s talking! It’s talking! It’s so gross!” 

“Billy, calm down!” the snail scolded. “Stop screaming! I need... help!” 
Sheena and I both gasped. 

We both realized the snail wasn’t talking. It was Dr. D.! 

“I’m trapped. Under the snail!” he choked out. “Can’t breathe. Get me out. 
Hurry.” 

Dr. D.’s hand waved weakly from under the big snail. His fingers were 
dripping with the thick white slime. 

“The slime—it’s as thick as shaving cream!” I murmured. 

“Kids, hurry! Can’t breathe under here! The slime... going up my nose!” 
“What should we do, Dr. D.?” Sheena asked. 

He didn’t reply. 

“He’s suffocating!” I cried. “He’s drowning in snail slime!” 

A groan floated out from under the monstrous snail shell. 

“We’ve got to hurry!” Sheena cried. 

“I’ll tilt the snail over,” I told Sheena. “You pull Dr. D. out.” 

“Okay.” 

Dr. D. moaned. 

“We’re coming! We’re coming!” I cried. 

I pushed the shell. It was heavy. It didn’t move. 

“Try harder, Billy.” Sheena stood nearby, ready to grab Dr. D. and pull him 
out. 

I lowered my shoulder and threw my weight against the snail. “It’s not 
budging!” 

“I have an idea,” Sheena said. “The slime!” 

“Huh? What about it?” 

“The slime can help us,” she explained. She stood behind the snail. “Let’s 
both push the snail from behind. Maybe the slime will make it slide right off 



him!” 

I heard Dr. D. choking under the snail. He was swallowing slime! 

I started to gag. But I swallowed hard. Held my breath. Forced the nausea 
away. 

Sheena and I planted our feet behind the snail. 

“One, two, three, push!” she yelled. 

We threw our weight against the snail. It slid a little bit. 

“One more time—go!” 

We pushed again. 

The snail slowly slid off Dr. D.’s body. It hit the floor with a heavy thud. 

Dr. D. slowly climbed to his feet. He was covered with sticky white goop 
from head to toe. 

He coughed and spat out a big glob of slime. “Not tasty,” he muttered, 
shaking his head. 

“Dr. D.—what happened?” I asked. 

He smeared the gunk from his eyes. “I don’t know. All of a sudden, the boat 
started shaking. I fell down. And the next thing I knew— BOOM !—I found this 
giant snail on top of me!” 

I glanced at the snail. It stood quietly in the passageway, oozing slime. 
Where did it come from? And how did a snail get so big? 

“It seemed to come out of thin air,” Dr. D. said. 

“It looks a lot like the snail in my fishbowl,” I offered. “But my snail is tiny. 
It’s the size of my fingernail.” 

“Dr. D.!” Sheena cried. “We saw two gigantic jellyfish! One of them tried 
to squeeze me to death!” 

“What?” Dr. D. turned to Sheena. “Giant jellyfish? What on earth is going 
on in these waters?” 

The boat lurched. 

“Whoa!” I cried out as I lost my balance. 

The boat rocked hard to one side. We all slammed against the wall. 

“Now what?” Sheena moaned. 

“Grab the rail, kids!” Dr. D. shouted. “We’re tipping over!” 



15 


The boat heaved to one side. The huge snail slid across the floor and crashed into 
the wall. 

Tables drifted across the floor. Pictures fell off the walls. 

Sheena, Dr. D., and I were pressed against the wall. The boat tilted until we 
were practically lying down. 

“What’s happening?” Sheena cried. 

Crash! My cabin door flew open. Something thudded heavily inside. 

“What was that?” I asked. “Something’s going on in my cabin!” 

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. I heard a heavy pounding sound from my room. 

“What on earth—?” Dr. D. murmured. 

Sheena gulped. “It sounds like some kind of monster!” 

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. 

“I’m going to check it out,” I said. 

I tried to stand, but the tilt of the boat kept me pinned to the wall. 

“I can’t get up!” I complained. 

Sheena slid along the wall. “Try sliding!” 

I inched along the passageway. Sheena and Dr. D. slid along behind me. 

I came to a closed door—the door to Sheena’s cabin. I tried to step around 
it, but the gravity pull was too strong. I leaned against the door... 

“Whoa!” It flew open. I was about to fall in! 

I grabbed the door frame. Sheena’s cabin floor tilted down behind me. It 
was like being in the fun house at a carnival. 

“Hold on, Billy!” Dr. D. said. 

The floor tilted like a steep hill. If I let go of the door, I’d slide down the 
cabin floor. Then I’d have to crawl my way back up to the passage—if I could. 

I clung to the door frame. The gravity pulled me into Sheena’s room. 

“Help!” My feet slipped out from under me. I felt the wood giving way 
under my fingernails. 

“Pull yourself back up!” Dr. D. instructed. “Don’t let go!” 

I hauled my body uphill and threw myself to the left. I felt my back slap 
against the passage wall. 



I made it. I made it past Sheena’s room. Now all I had to do was slide down 
the passage to my cabin. 

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. The pounding sound again, inside my cabin. 
Behind me, Sheena and Dr. D. struggled past the gaping door to Sheena’s 
cabin. 

At last I reached my cabin. The pounding grew louder. BOOM, BOOM, 
BOOM. 

What was going on in there? 

I peered through the doorway. 

“My goldfish!” I gasped. “Oh, nooooo!” 



16 


My goldfish bowl had smashed to the floor. My two fish lay in a puddle, 
flopping their tails. 

At least they looked like my goldfish. But there was one difference—one 
huge difference. 

My goldfish were gigantic! 

They filled my cabin. They were the size of small whales! 

Well, maybe not that big. But they were at least as big as me. 

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. They flopped on the floor, their tails pounding into 
the wood. 

“They—they’re giants!” I gasped. 

“What’s going on?” Sheena cried. “How did everything get so big?” 

“Oh, my. Oh, my!” Dr. D. muttered over and over. “Oh, my!” He seemed to 
be in shock. 

We all stared at the fish. First the minnow, then the snail, and now this. It 
was hard to believe. 

What was happening? Why was everything suddenly growing so huge? 

“I feel like I’m living in some kind of dinosaur world,” I said. “Only instead 
of dinosaurs, we’re surrounded by giant sea creatures!” 

Dr. D. shook his head to clear it. “I’ve got to get a grip on myself. We’ve 
got big problems here!” 

“Huge problems!” Sheena added. 

“No wonder the boat’s tipping over,” Dr. D. said. “Those fish are 
monstrous! Their weight is pulling the boat over.” 

“My goldfish, my goldfish!” I couldn’t believe it. 

They looked beautiful, all golden and shiny. You could really see them now 
that they were so big—nearly as big as horses. Little brown specks on their gills 
and their scales glittered in the sunlight that spilled through my porthole. 

“We’ve got to get rid of them,” Dr. D. said. “Otherwise, they’ll tip over the 
boat.” 

“Can we shove them through the window?” Sheena asked. 

“They’re too big,” Dr. D. said. “We’ll have to haul them up to the deck 
somehow.” 



“And then what?” I asked. 

“Throw them overboard,” Dr. D. declared. “We can’t keep them here, that’s 
for sure.” 

“Maybe they’ll be happier in the ocean,” Sheena reasoned. “They probably 
hated being cooped up in that little bowl, anyway.” 

“But goldfish are freshwater fish!” I protested. 

“We have no choice, Billy,” Dr. D. said grimly. 

“We won’t survive out here. We won’t be able to sail anywhere—unless we 
get these giant fish overboard.” 

I knew he was right. The fish had to go. 

“You two grab the tail. I’ll push from the other side,” my uncle said. 

I tugged on the slick golden tail. “Unh—it’s so heavy!” I grunted. 

The fish flopped. The tail slapped Sheena’s hand. 

“Ow!” she cried. “That hurt!” 

“Hold him still!” Dr. D. ordered. 

We dragged the first fish out of my room—uphill—and into the passage. 
The snail no longer blocked our path. The snail slime in the passage helped us 
slide it out. 

We hauled the big fish up the steps. It flopped on the deck. 

“Good-bye, goldfish,” I said. 

We shoved it overboard. It flipped its tail and swam away. 

“Now we have to do it all over again,” Sheena complained. 

“And what about the snail?” I said. “It’s even heavier than these fish!” 

“One monster at a time,” Dr. D. said. 

As soon as we dragged the other fish overboard, the boat righted itself. 
“What a relief,” Dr. D. said. “I can stand up straight again!” 

“I’m beat,” Sheena whined. “This has been the worst day of my life.” 

We started back down below. The boat looked like the set of a disaster 
movie. Broken glass everywhere, pools of water, floors and walls streaked with 
white slime. And the giant snail sitting in the corner. 

“What are we going to do about him?” Sheena asked. 

Dr. D. sighed heavily. “Let’s just leave him for now.” 

I slipped on a puddle of slime on my way to my cabin. 

My cabin. What a mess. 

It looked as if a giant had come, turned it upside down, and shaken it. 



I headed for the closet to get a mop. I stopped. 

I thought I heard something. 

I listened. Yes. Footsteps. Up on deck. 

“Dr. D.?” I called. 

“Right here, Billy,” he answered. He was busy cleaning up his lab. 

Sheena popped out of her cabin. “Did you hear that?” she asked. 

I nodded. “Someone’s up on deck.” 

Dr. D. came out of the lab, wiping his hands on a towel. He glanced at me, 
then at Sheena. Then he looked up toward the ceiling. 

“If we’re all down here,” he began, “then who’s walking around up there?” 

We crept up the stairs and stepped out on deck. The afternoon sun beat 
down on us. “I don’t see anyone,” I said. “Look behind you,” boomed a deep 
voice. We turned around. There stood three men. Three total strangers. 



17 


The three men stood side by side, wearing shorts, button-down shirts, and 
boating shoes. 

The man who had spoken was tall and thin, with glasses and longish brown 
hair. On his left stood a burly, sunburned blond man. On the right, a curly-haired 
guy with a long, beaky nose on a birdlike face. 

I’d never seen any of them before. What were they doing on our boat? 

Dr. D. cleared his throat. “May I help you?” 

The tall man spoke. “I hope we didn’t frighten you. And I’m sorry to barge 
aboard like this, but we were worried. Are you in trouble? We saw your boat 
tilting dangerously to one side and became alarmed.” 

Dr. D. chuckled, trying to act casual. “We hit some rough water,” he lied. 
“But everything is all right now, as you can see.” 

Where did these guys come from? I wondered. I stepped to the edge of the 
deck and saw a motorboat tied up to the side. 

“I was afraid you were going to tip over,” the man said. “We thought we 
would have to rescue you!” 

“No, no. We’re fine now. Aren’t we, kids?” Dr. D. insisted. 

“Fine?” I blurted out. “What about—” 

Dr. D. squeezed my shoulder. Hard. I shut my mouth. 

Why was Dr. D. acting as if everything were okay? 

When goldfish blow up into monsters, everything is not okay. 

“It was very kind of you to come and help.” Dr. D. let go of my shoulder, 
finally. I rubbed it. 

“My pleasure.” The tall man smiled. “I’m glad there’s no trouble. Always 
happy to help a fellow sailor.” 

He offered his right hand. “I’m Dr. Ritter. These are my assistants, Mel 
Mason and Adam Brown.” Mel was the burly blond one. Adam was the curly- 
haired beaky one. 

Dr. D. shook his hand. “Nice to meet you. I’m Dr. George Deep. This is my 
nephew, Billy, and my niece, Sheena.” 

“Hi, kids. Wow, they look like good, strong swimmers.” 

Dr. D. grinned. “They are.” 



“What kind of doctor are you, Dr. Deep?” Dr. Ritter asked. “A surgeon on 
vacation?” 

Dr. D. shook his head. “No. I’m a marine biologist. The Cassandra is my 
floating lab.” 

“Really?” he asked. “A fellow scientist! Wonderful!” 

Dr. Ritter began to stroll around the deck, gazing at the ropes and 
equipment. His assistants followed him. 

“Tve got a floating lab myself,” Dr. Ritter told us. “Not far from here, as a 
matter-of-fact.” 

He sucked in a big breath of salty air and patted his chest. “Ah, yes. We 
marine biologists are a noble bunch, don’t you think, Dr. Deep? Studying the 
mysteries of the sea. It’s the last true frontier on earth, I always say.” 

Dr. D. trailed after him. “Yes. The last frontier,” he agreed. 

“What are you working on, if I may ask?” Dr. Ritter said. 

Dr. D. cleared his throat. “Oh, Tve got a couple of projects going. I can’t 
really talk about them now, Dr. Ritter. They’re in their early stages. I’m sure you 
understand.” 

The three strangers paused by the ladder where their boat was tied. 

“Yes. Indeed. I guess we should be leaving,” Dr. Ritter said. “I’m glad 
you’re all safe.” 

“Thanks for stopping to help,” Dr. D. said. 

Dr. Ritter put his hand on the ladder. Then he stopped. 

“By the way—you haven’t seen anything strange in the waters around here 
lately, have you?” 

“Strange?” Dr. D. asked. “What do you mean?” 

“Odd fish, unusual creatures, anything like that?” 

Odd fish! I couldn’t hold it in any longer. “We’ve seen all kinds of weird 
stuff!” I gushed. “My goldfish turned into giants! And we saw huge jellyfish 
bigger than a car! Ow!” 

Something sharp poked me in the ribs. My uncle’s elbow. 

Whoops. 

“I’m sorry to hear that,” Dr. Ritter said. 

“Yes, it was really scary!” I agreed. “Ow!” Dr. D.’s elbow again. “What did 
you do that for?” 

He frowned at me. 

What? I thought. What did I do this time? 



“Billy is just joking,” Dr. D. assured him. He played nervously with his 
glasses. 

Dr. Ritter said, “Joking? You weren’t really joking—were you, Billy?” 
“Well...” I gazed up at Dr. D. I didn’t know what to say. 

“I’m really sorry,” Dr. Ritter repeated. “I’m sorry you saw those creatures, 
Billy. Because now I can’t let you go.” 

“Huh?” I gasped. “What are you talking about?” 

“You’ve seen too much,” Dr. Ritter replied solemnly. “And now I have to 
decide what to do with you.” 

He snapped his fingers. The two assistants moved in. 



18 


“Hold on, there.” Dr. D. put his arms around me and Sheena. “Don’t pay any 
attention to Billy. He has a wild imagination.” 

“The wildest,” Sheena piped in. 

“He’s always making up stories,” Dr. D. went on. 

“He’s a big fat liar,” Sheena added. “Everybody knows that.” 

“Believe me, Dr. Bitter,” my uncle pleaded. “We haven’t seen anything 
strange at all. I mean, a giant goldfish? You’re a scientist, Dr. Bitter. You know 
as well as I do that that is impossible.” 

Dr. Bitter opened his mouth to speak. Something stopped him. Aloud noise. 
A loud, lumbering, thudding sound. 

CRASH! PLOP! 

Something broke through the doors and bounced onto the deck. 

The giant snail. 

I dropped my head in my hands. “Oh, no!” 

Dr. Ritter raised an eyebrow. “Looks like your brother is not the big fat liar 
you say he is.” 

“Oh, he’s a big fat liar, all right,” Sheena insisted. “And he’s stupid too.” 

I kicked her in the shins. 

“Ow!” she cried. 

“Kids, quiet!” Dr. D. commanded. 

The burly blond guy grabbed me. He pinned my arms behind my back with 
one hand and gripped me around the neck with the other. 

“Let go of me!” I shrieked. “That hurts!” 

“Quiet—or I’ll really hurt you!” the blond guy threatened. 

The beaky guy grabbed Sheena. She squirmed and tried to kick him. But he 
was too strong for her. 

“Let them go!” Dr. D. cried. 

Mel tightened his grip on me. 

“I’m so sorry, Dr. Deep,” Dr. Ritter said. “I hate to harm a fellow scientist. 
But you shouldn’t have snooped around here. I hate snoops.” 

He sighed. “What a shame you wandered into my plankton beds. What a 



shame you poked your nose into my experiments.” 

“What experiments?” Dr. D. asked. 

Dr. Ritter laid a strong hand on Dr. D.’s shoulder. “I’m working on such a 
brilliant project. It could change the world. It could solve all our problems!” 

“What is it?” 

“Ha-ha. You are a curious fellow!” Dr. Ritter laughed. “Well, I may as well 
tell you. I’ve been injecting a growth hormone into the plankton beds in these 
waters. The fish who feed on the plankton grow to be very large. You’ve seen 
the results yourself.” 

Dr. D. nodded. “But how does that solve any problems?” 

“In my heart, I’m a good man,” Dr. Ritter said. “I don’t want to hurt 
anyone. I want to help everyone ! I plan to raise huge fish to feed the world. No 
one will ever have to go hungry!” 

“Let go of me!” Sheena screamed. Adam still held her tightly. 

“This one is noisy,” Adam complained. 

“Let her go,” Dr. Ritter said. “For now.” 

Adam dropped his arms. But he stayed right behind Sheena. 

“Your experiments sound interesting, Dr. Ritter,” my uncle said. “I’d like to 
hear more. Are they working?” 

Dr. Ritter smiled. I could tell he liked to talk about his work. “Well, there 
are a few kinks at the moment. But nothing I can’t fix.” 

“What are you going to do with us?” Sheena broke in. 

Dr. Ritter frowned at her. “I’m afraid you know too much.” 

“But I am a scientist,” Dr. D. declared. “I would never tell anyone about 
your work. You have my word on that.” 

“Your word isn’t enough,” Dr. Ritter growled. His temper flared. His face 
reddened. “I can’t let anyone steal my idea.” 

“I would never steal!” my uncle insisted. 

“I’ll make sure of that,” the other scientist replied coldly. He turned to his 
two assistants. “Take them.” 

Before Sheena or I could move, Mel and Adam grabbed us and forced us 
into their motorboat. 

I broke away for a second. And scrambled for the ladder, trying to get back 
to the Cassandra. 

But before I could reach it, they grabbed Dr. D. and forced him aboard their 
boat too. 



Mel cut the line with one flick of a knife. Adam started the motor. 

It all happened so fast. We didn’t have a chance. 

Dr. Ritter jumped aboard and grabbed the wheel. He steered the boat out to 

sea. 

“Where are you taking us?” I cried. “What are you going to do?” 



19 


“Get down there!” Adam shoved Dr. D. down into the small cabin. Sheena and I 
stumbled after him. Mel followed behind us. 

“What are you going to do?” I repeated. 

“You’ll see,” Adam growled. 

We marched through a tiny galley. Mel and Adam forced us through a small 
door into a stuffy cabin with a table and chairs. Mel tied Dr. D. to a chair. 

“This really isn’t necessary,” my uncle said softly. I could see he was trying 
to sound calm. 

“Tell that to Dr. Ritter,” Mel muttered. 

Adam tied up Sheena, then me. 

“Not so tight!” I cried. I leaned over and bit Adam’s arm. 

“Good one, Billy!” Sheena bounced in her chair. 

“Hey!” Adam pulled back, rubbing his arm. “This kid bit me!” 

“Bite him back,” Mel muttered. 

Adam bared his teeth at me. But he didn’t bite me. And he didn’t tighten 
my ropes. 

My plan worked. I was tied to the chair—but not as tightly as he thought. 

Mel and Adam studied us. “Okay. We’ve taken care of them,” Mel said. 
“Let’s go get some lunch.” 

They left the cabin, shutting the door behind them. I could hear them in the 
little galley, rattling plates and silverware. 

I glanced out the porthole to my right. The boat was speeding away, far 
from the Cassandra. Out to sea. 

I jiggled my hands, trying to loosen the ropes. They were tied pretty well. If 
I could just get the rope to stretch a little... 

“What could this guy Ritter be up to?” Dr. D. wondered out loud. He wasn’t 
really talking to me and Sheena. He was figuring things out for himself. 

“This plankton he’s invented really does make fish grow bigger,” he said. 
“It could help end hunger in the world.” 

“Isn’t that good, Dr. D.?” Sheena asked. 

I rubbed my wrists against the ropes. Come on, loosen, I thought. 



“It might be good,” Dr. D. went on. “But it could be bad too. It could throw 
the whole balance of nature off.” 

Rub, rub, rub. I tested the ropes. Were they a little looser? 

“I mean, what are these giant fish supposed to eat? More and more 
plankton? They might eat up all the little fish. They might even start eating 
people. Who knows?” 

I stretched my hands against the ropes. The knot had loosened! I tried to 
pull one of my hands through. 

No. Still too tight. 

“And Dr. Ritter mentioned some kinks,” my uncle continued. “Some 
problems. I wonder what he was talking about. It could be anything.” 

I strained to hear what Mel and Adam were doing in the galley. It sounded 
as if they had taken their lunch up on deck. 

I yanked the ropes hard. I felt something give. 

I squeezed one hand through the rope. The knot burned against my skin. 

Pulling, pulling... 

I got it out! One hand was free! 

“Dr. D.!” I whispered. I held up my free hand. 

“Good going, Billy!” he whispered back. 

I untied my other hand and leaped up to untie my uncle. 

“Billy, hurry!” Sheena urged me. “Maybe we can sneak off the boat!” 

Then the door flew open. 

“You interrupted my lunch,” Dr. Ritter said, shaking his head. “That’s not 
very polite.” 

He blocked the doorway. Mel and Adam planted themselves beside him. 

“You want to get off the boat?” he asked. “That can be arranged. Mel, 
Adam. Take them on deck!” he ordered. 

Mel and Adam untied Sheena and Dr. D. and dragged us upstairs. Dr. 
Ritter’s lunch—sandwiches, a salad—sat half eaten on a table. 

The two men herded us to the side of the boat. I looked down. 

The ocean churned beneath us. No other boats, not a patch of land in sight. 

No one, nothing to save us. 

Nothing but sea—endless, deep sea. 

And gigantic, hungry, sea creatures. 

“Which one of you will jump first?” Dr. Ritter asked. “Or do you all want 
to go together?” 



I gazed down at the thrashing waves. Then I took a deep breath— 
And got ready to jump. 



20 


The waves crashed beneath me. My heart pounded so hard, it hurt. 

I sucked in a lungful of air. This could be my last breath, I realized. 

“Stop!” Dr. D. cried. “Let me jump, Ritter. Spare the kids. They can’t harm 
you or your experiments.” 

“I think a family should stick together,” Dr. Ritter said. “Especially a family 
of snoops.” 

“We’re not snoops!” Sheena protested. “We can’t help it if we accidentally 
saw some of your big fish!” 

“We won’t tell anyone about them! Really!” I cried. 

Dr. Ritter leaned close to Sheena. “Perhaps you would like to go first?” 

Sheena glared at him, but I saw her shaking. I knew she was really scared. 
And Sheena hardly ever gets scared. 

“Leave her alone,” Dr. D. warned. “Take us to an island—any island. 
Whatever is nearest. Then we won’t be able to tell anyone about your plankton 
experiments.” 

Dr. Ritter scowled. “There are no islands nearby. And I can’t take the 
chance. Sorry.” 

Dr. D. refused to give up. He kept trying to stall, to talk his way out of this. 

But there was no way. I could see that. 

Think! Think! I ordered myself desperately. There’s got to be some way to 
escape. There’s got to be. 

I glanced around, searching for something, anything. Maybe a life jacket! 
Didn’t they have life jackets on the boat? Or a floating ring? 

If I could grab some kind of float, at least we’d have a chance. 

But I didn’t see anything on the deck. I craned my neck to look back at the 
stern. 

My heart beat faster. Yes! A rubber lifeboat. 

“What are you looking at, kid?” Mel growled. “You looking for the coast 
guard or something? Believe me, there’s no one around to rescue you so forget 
about it.” 

“I—I wasn’t looking at anything,” I stammered. I was so scared, I could 
hardly breathe. 



“Enough of this stalling around,” Dr. Ritter interrupted. “You’re wasting my 
time. And you’re wasting your breath. And you’re going to need all the breath 
you’ve got. It’s time for a swim.” 

Sheena let out a scream. 

“Let her go,” Dr. D. shouted. 

Two strong hands gripped my shoulders. 

“Help!” I shrieked. “Please—no!” 

But screaming did no good. 

They pushed me over the side. 



21 


I shut my eyes and prepared for the cold shock of the water. 

But I didn’t fall. 

The strong hands didn’t let go. 

I felt myself pulled back into the boat—as a dark shadow swept overhead. 
“Huh?” I blinked several times. Was it a shadow—or my eyes? 

I heard a deafening noise. A clattering. A beating sound. 

I turned to Dr. D. He and the others all had their eyes on the sky. 

A helicopter? I thought. Is it a helicopter? Someone to rescue us? 

No. That clapping, pounding sound couldn’t be a helicopter’s roar. 

Another shadow swooped over the boat. 

And then an ugly cry ripped through the air. 

RRRAAAAAK! RRAAAAAAK! 

“Oh, no!” Dr. D. cried. “Here they come!” 

I shielded my eyes with one hand. And I saw them. 

Swooping low. Two enormous birds. Seagulls. Seagulls as big as my golden 
Lab back home! 

RRRAAAAAK! RRAAiAAAK! Their sharp cries were so shrill, they hurt my 

ears. 

“Here come two more victims of your great experiments, Ritter,” my uncle 
shouted over the pounding of their wings. 

“They must have eaten the plankton too!” Dr. Ritter exclaimed. 

The birds circled the boat. They cast huge shadows over us, their wings 
stretched out like sails. 

As I squinted up at them, they stopped circling. 

And lowered their talons. 

Are they hunting for food? I wondered, staring up at the sharp bird claws, 
gleaming in the sunlight. 

Are we the food? 

Before we could duck or try to hide, the two huge birds soared toward us. 
Talons raised. Ready to clutch their prey. 

Screeching all the way down. 



22 


I froze in panic. 

The screeching rang in my ears. Filled my brain. Made me feel as if my 
head would burst. 

I stared up at the raised talons. 

The shadows of the screeching birds washed over me. 

And then I felt a strong hand pushing me down. Down to the deck. I turned 
back and saw my uncle, his jaw set, his eyes on the sky. 

He pushed Sheena and me down. Then moved over us. Protecting us. 

I couldn’t see them. But I felt the heavy thud as the two heavy gulls landed 
on the boat. 

And then I heard the shouts of Dr. Ritter and his men. Angry shouts, over 
the shrill squawks of the birds. 

I twisted my head. Tried to see. But my uncle pushed my head down again. 
Holding his arms over Sheena and me. 

I heard a struggle behind us. More squawks. More frantic cries. 

I heard the heavy pounding of wings. 

A table fell over. Dishes crashed to the floor. 

A cry of pain. 

“Quick, kids—now’s our chance!” Dr. D. whispered. He pulled us to our 
feet. Then, protecting us with his back, he shoved us across the deck to the 
lifeboat. 

“Billy! Help me untie this thing!” Dr. D. ordered. 

The three of us struggled with the knots that held the lifeboat to the deck. 

“Hurry!” Dr. D. urged us. “Before they see what we’re up to!” 

“RRRAAAAK!” I turned and saw that one of the birds had Adam pinned 
under its sharp claws. Mel and Dr. Ritter were struggling to pull the powerful 
bird off him. 

“This knot’s undone!” Sheena announced. She worked on another knot. 

I nervously tugged at the knot in my hands. I was so scared, I couldn’t 
think. My fingers felt thick and clumsy. 

Hurry! I ordered myself. Hurry—before they catch us! 



Finally, I ripped open the last knot and pulled the lifeboat free. Dr. D. tossed 
it into the water, holding it by a rope. 

“Okay. Let’s go! Jump in! Now!” 

I gripped the rail of the motorboat and braced myself to jump. 

“Hey!” I heard a cry behind me. I turned back and saw Mel staring at us. 
“Hey—they’re getting away!” 

He motioned to us. “Stop!” he shouted. He grabbed a spear gun. “Don’t 
move!” he ordered. 

I hesitated. The sharp point of the metal spear sparkled in the sunlight. 
Would he really shoot us? 

“Go, kids! Now!” Dr. D. cried. 

Mel aimed the spear gun at my uncle—and fired. 



23 


WHOOSH! 

I couldn’t see it. It moved so fast, I could only hear the spear fly through 
the air. 

To my horror, Dr. D. slumped to the deck. 

“You—you shot him!” I shrieked. 

“Dr. D.! Dr. D.!” Sheena cried. We both hurried to his side. 

Our uncle sat up. 

“It—it missed!” He seemed surprised. He leaped to his feet. “Into the 
lifeboat, kids! ” he cried. 

A gull squawked. I heard Adam scream. Mel turned back to help him. 

I took a running jump, shut my eyes, and threw myself overboard. 

PLOP! I landed in the soft rubber boat. Sheena jumped in after me. Then 
Dr. D. 

“Stop, or I’ll shoot!” Dr. Ritter called. He picked up Mel’s spear gun and 
aimed it at us. 

A gull’s wing bumped his arm, knocking the gun into the water. 

We frantically scooped our hands through the water, paddling away from 
Dr. Ritter’s boat. 

“You can’t escape!” Dr. Ritter called after us, shaking his fist. “I’ll get 
you!” 

Dr. D. grabbed the lifeboat paddles. He started paddling with all his 
strength. The ocean pulled us away. 

The ocean turned rough and foamy. A wind kicked up and blasted us, 
churning up huge waves. The waves carried us quickly out to sea. 

Dr. Ritter’s boat faded into the distance. 

“Well, we escaped,” Sheena sighed. “But where are we going?” 

No sign of land anywhere. No sign of another boat. Nothing but water. 
Churning water and crashing waves. 

The rubber lifeboat smacked down hard on the water. “Hold on, kids,” Dr. 
D. shouted. “Here comes a big one!” 

I gripped the sides of the boat as a huge wave tossed us into the air. 



THUMP! We landed in a valley between waves. Then another wave 
smashed over us. 

I shivered, totally soaked. 

“Is everybody okay?” Dr. D. asked. Sheena and I nodded. 

Then a gigantic wave caught us from behind. 

The lifeboat bounced high in the air. I clung to the side. 

But Sheena’s hands slipped off. She flew up into the air—and disappeared 
into the white foam. 

“Sheena!” I screamed. “She fell overboard!” 

Her head bobbed up. “H-h-help!” she sputtered. She sank below again, her 
arms thrashing. 

I waited for her to bob back up. 

Waited. 

Waited. 

Please—I prayed. 

And then there she was. I leaned over the side. Leaned forward. More. 
More... 

And grabbed her arm and hauled her back into the boat. 

“Are you all right, Sheena?” Dr. D. asked. 

She coughed. Water ran down her face. “I think so.” 

Dr. D. held on to her as another big wave drenched us. 

We huddled in the lifeboat, wet, shivering, hungry, and tired. The lifeboat 
puddled with water. It was like sitting in a wading pool. 

The sky grew dark. It would be night soon. 

We’ll have to spend the night out here, I realized. Out here in the middle of 
the ocean. 

We can’t even rest. The ocean is so rough. If we let go of the boat for a 
second, we could be thrown into the sea. 

We had no food, no water. Nothing. 

“It can’t get any worse than this, can it?” I demanded. “Can it?” Sheena 
sneezed. Dr. D. said nothing. It can’t get any worse, I repeated to myself. And 
then it did. 



24 


The sky darkened to black. Then lightning crackled overhead. 

KABOOM! 

A roar of thunder shook our tiny lifeboat. 

Rain poured down on us. Heavy sheets of cold rain. 

“I don’t believe this!” Sheena wailed. She wiped strands of wet hair from 
her face. 

We sat glumly in the boat. The waves bounced us. The wind blew across 
our drenched skin. The rain hammered down on us. 

Lightning ripped across the sky. 

Dr. D. gazed up at the heavy, low clouds and frowned. “It’s not going to let 
up anytime soon,” he announced. 

Great. 

Meanwhile, the lifeboat filled up with water. 

Dr. D. tried to scoop the water out with his hands. “Help me bail, kids!” he 
ordered. “If the boat fills up too much, we’ll sink!” 

We furiously scooped the water out. But the rain filled the boat as fast as we 
could empty it. What were we going to do? 

I took off one of my sneakers and tried bailing water with it. It worked 
better than nothing. So Dr. D. and Sheena used their shoes to bail too. 

The rain roared down for hours. “I’m so tired!” I complained. I threw down 
my shoe. “I can’t bail any more water. I can’t!” 

“Don’t give up, Billy,” Dr. D. scolded. “We’ll make it.” He didn’t sound as 
if he really believed it, though. 

“Don’t worry,” he said, shouting over a boom of thunder. “We’re going to 
be all right.” 

I don’t see how, I thought. If we don’t starve to death, we’ll sink! There’s 
no one around to save us. No one... 

The rain finally stopped. By then it was night. Totally dark. No moon. No stars. 
Just a black sky blanketed by clouds. 

“I’m so cold,” Sheena whined. 

“I’m hungry,” I added. 



“I’m seasick!” Dr. D. admitted. 

“I’m all three,” I told them. “Plus thirsty, tired, and wet.” 

We all laughed. What else could we do? 

When things get this bad, it suddenly seems ridiculous! 

We huddled together for warmth. My stomach growled. 

But I was so tired... so tired. I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I fell asleep. 

I woke up with a THUMP. The boat had hit something. 

I opened my eyes. And stared out at a silvery, pale world. 

I’m dreaming, I thought. I closed my eyes again. 

But then I felt my wet clothes sticking to my skin. 

No, I realized. I’m awake. 

My eyes flew open. Sheena and Dr. D. sat up, yawning and stretching. 
“What’s happening?” Sheena murmured. 

“The boat’s not moving,” I realized. “It stopped.” 

I reached out to touch the water. Instead of water, my fingers sifted through 

sand. 

Dry land! 

“Hey!” I cried. “We’ve landed somewhere!” 

The sky lightened a little. The sun was just rising. I could begin to make out 
where we were. 

“Land!” Sheena shouted. She jumped out of the boat. “Hurray! Land! I 
don’t believe it! I don’t believe it!” 

Dr. D. stood up and stretched. “Wow! That feels good.” 

The sun shone brighter now. I threw myself on the sand. “Bake me, sun!” I 
sighed. 

“I wonder where we are,” Dr. D. said softly, gazing around. 

“Wherever we are, I hope they’ve got food,” Sheena added. 

Our lifeboat had landed on a sandy beach. Up a slope I could see a stand of 
palm trees. Other than that, nothing. No docks, no boats, no houses. 

“No sign of any people,” Dr. D. noted. “I’m going to take a look around.” 
“I’m coming too,” I said. 

“Me too!” Sheena said. 

We followed Dr. D. along the beach. We walked along the edge of the 
water. 

“Look! A coconut tree!” Sheena pointed to a tall tree on the beach. A few 



coconuts nestled in the sand beneath it. 

“Let’s open one,” she insisted. “I’m starving!” 

Dr. D. grabbed a coconut and smashed it against a rock. The coconut split 
open. 

Sheena and I pounced on it. We picked up the broken pieces and chewed 
the coconut meat. 

“Feel better?” Dr. D. asked, sipping coconut milk from the shell. 

I wiped the sweet liquid from my chin. “A little,” I said. “But I could sure 
use a hamburger. Make that two. And a double order of french fries with tons of 
catsup.” 

“Or a pizza,” Sheena added. 

“We’ll catch some fish later,” Dr. D. promised. “We can build a fire and 
cook them.” 

We continued our way around the island. 

“Maybe we’ll find a restaurant,” Sheena wished out loud. 

But after about ten minutes, Dr. D. groaned. “Oh, no!” 

“What is it?” I asked. 

“Look.” He pointed a few yards down the beach. 

Our lifeboat. We were right back where we’d started. 

“You mean, that’s it?” I asked. “We’ve seen the whole island in ten 
minutes?” 

“That’s it.” Dr. D. sighed. “It’s tiny.” 

Sheena sighed too. “I’m still hungry. And I don’t want coconuts!” 

“Looks as if we’ve landed on a deserted island,” Dr. D. said. “But don’t 
worry. We’ll find something to eat.” 

I touched my face. My skin was hot. The sun had felt so good at first—but 
now I was getting sunburned. 

Another question nagged at me. But I was so hungry, I tried to push it out of 
my mind. 

“Billy, run into that clump of palm trees,” Dr. D. ordered. “See if you can 
find some wood to build a fire.” 

I wandered into the grove, hunting for something to burn. There wasn’t 
much to be found. Mostly a lot of vines. 

And that nagging worry wouldn’t go away. 

We were stuck on a tiny island, with nothing but a rubber raft. 

And I had one question, a question I was afraid to ask out loud: 



How were we ever going to get off? 



25 


I found a few sticks and carried them back to the beach. Dr. D. was digging a pit 
for the fire. 

“Good job, Billy.” He took the sticks from me. “This will do for now.” 

Sheena was wading near the shore. I sat down on the sand. “Dr. D.—” I 
began. “What are we going to do? Do you think we’re far from the Cassandra ?” 

Dr. D. sighed. “I’m afraid I have no idea where we are,” he admitted. 

“So—what’s going to happen? Are we going to rot on this island?” I knew 
we couldn’t last long. So far, we’d had nothing to eat but coconuts. 

Dr. D. rubbed two of the sticks together, trying to get them to light. “Maybe 
someone will see our fire. Maybe a plane will fly over us, or a boat will pass by. 
Maybe someone will find the Cassandra empty and come searching for us.” 

I leaned back and gazed at the empty sky. “But that could take forever!” I 
cried. “Nobody even knows we’re missing! Except Dr. Ritter—and I don’t want 
him to find us.” 

I heard a shriek. I turned and saw Sheena running up the beach, waving 
something in one hand. 

“Look! Hey—check this out!” she shouted. “I caught a fish! I caught a fish 
with my bare hands!” 

She held out a small, wriggling silverfish. 

“It’s puny,” I said. 

“So? Let’s see you catch one!” she shot back. 

Dr. D. took the fish and set it on the sand. “It’s better than nothing.” 

“I’ll catch a bigger one,” I declared. 

Sheena and I raced back to the water. We waded in hip-high. A few small 
fish darted around us. 

“These are all pretty small,” I complained. “We need some of Dr. Ritter’s 
plankton to make them grow.” 

“I wouldn’t want to eat one of his giant fish,” Sheena replied, making a 
disgusted face. “Yuck.” 

“Maybe if we go a little deeper we’ll find bigger fish,” I suggested. 

We waded in farther. A silverfish with a black stripe swam past me. 

“That one is a little bigger,” I said. I made a grab for it. Missed. 



I tried again. I swam out a little farther, chasing the fish. 

I guess I waded out deeper than I meant to. Suddenly I felt a sharp pain in 
my foot. 

At first I thought Sheena was pinching me. But the pain quickly swept up 
my whole leg. “Hey—what’s going on?” I cried. I lowered my gaze to the water 
—and let out a frightened scream. 



26 


“Oh, nooooo!” I moaned. 

I stared down at the water—down at the creature beneath the water. 

I saw a hairy back. A brown-purple shell. Enormous pincers. 

And knew I’d been grabbed by a giant crab! 

The crab was as big as a card table. And it squeezed my toe in a pincer the 
size of my dad’s lug wrench! 

“Help!” I screeched. “Ohhhh, help!” 

The crab snapped its claws. I managed to slip my toe out of its grip. 

Slipping and stumbling, I scrambled back to shore as fast as I could. 

“A giant crab!” I shouted. “Hey—look out! It’s following me!” 

Sheena let out a gasp and came splashing out of the water. 

The giant crab scrabbled onto the sand, moving sideways, its hairy legs 
moving rapidly. 

“I don’t believe it!” Dr. D. cried. 

The crab moved toward us with amazing speed, snapping its claws. Click... 
click... CLICK. 

“Into the trees! Quick!” Dr. D. shouted. 

We ran into the palm tree grove. I scrambled up a tree, out of the crab’s 
reach. Sheena climbed up behind me. Dr. D. grabbed the branch of another tree 
and swung himself up. 

The crab watched us from below. It raised its hairy claws as if reaching for 
us. Click... CLICK. 

“If only we could cook it!” Sheena exclaimed hungrily. “That thing could 
feed us for a week!” 

“It must have eaten some of Dr. Ritter’s plankton! Its huge size has made 
this crab very hungry!” 

The crab clicked its big claws, trying to grab us. Its body heaved in and out, 
in and out. 

It stood there for what seemed like hours. 

“How long will it wait before it gives up?” I asked. 

Dr. D. shrugged. “Your guess is as good as mine.” 



I heard a crack. 

At first, I thought it was the crab claws snapping. 

Another crack. Too close to be the crab. 

Coming from right beneath Sheena and me. 

The tree branch. 

Crack. 

To my horror, I realized that Sheena and I were too heavy for it. The branch 
was breaking off the tree. 

My sister and I were about to drop into the crab’s waiting claws. 



27 


With a low cry, I reached up both arms. I tried to grab the branch above us. 

I reached... reached... 

No. My arms were too short. 

“We—we’re falling!” Sheena cried. 

With a loud craaaack, our branch broke off. 

And we tumbled down... down... onto the crab’s hairy back. 

No. 

Onto the hot sand. 

“Huh?” I gasped and spun around. 

The crab had moved away. It was scrabbling rapidly back toward the water. 
Sheena sat up, her expression still startled. 

Our uncle climbed down from his branch. “Are you two okay?” 

We watched the huge creature splash back into the ocean. 

“I’m never going back in that water,” I declared. 

“Who knows what other monsters are waiting in there!” 

“But how will we catch any fish?” Sheena wailed. “We’re going to starve to 
death!” 

Dr. D. wasn’t listening to us. He had turned away and was gazing down the 
beach. “Oh, no!” he cried. “The tide—it came in! The life raft!” 

All three of us started running to the spot where we’d left our lifeboat. But 
it was gone. 

I stared out over the ocean—and I spotted a yellow speck in the distance. 
The lifeboat. 

The tide had carried it away. 

“Now we’ll never get off this stupid island!” I cried. “Never.” 

Dr. D. didn’t reply. He didn’t need to say anything. The worried expression 
on his face said it all. 

We passed the rest of the day keeping in the shade, chewing coconut meat. 

“I’ll never eat coconut again,” Sheena whined. “Not even in candy bars!” 
We didn’t talk much. What was there to say? 



Night fell slowly. We watched the sky fade from blue to purple to black. 

Dr. D. sat up suddenly. “Did you hear that?” he asked. 

I sat up too. And listened hard. 

“What is it?” Sheena asked. 

“It’s coming from the beach,” Dr. D. said. 

We walked quickly down to the beach. Two huge animals splashed and 
played in the water. 

“Whales!” Sheena cried. 

“No—not whales,” Dr. D. said. “Dolphins!” 

The dolphins ate the plankton too, I realized. 

“What’s that yellow thing they’re playing with?” Sheena asked. “It looks 
like—” 

“It is!” I shouted. “Our lifeboat! The dolphins brought it back!” 

The lifeboat rope had tangled around the middle of one of the dolphins. 
Wherever the dolphin swam, the boat trailed behind it. 

“Let’s go rescue it!” Dr. D. cried. He splashed into the water. Sheena and I 
followed him. No time to worry about giant crabs. We had to get that raft. 

We swam out to where the dolphins played. They gurgled at us. They didn’t 
seem afraid of us at all. 

Why should they be? They were a lot bigger than we were! 

They’re only dolphins, I told myself. Dolphins don’t hurt people. 

But I was a little afraid of them. Especially since our visit from the giant 

crab. 

Dr. D. grabbed the edge of the rubber raft. Sheena and I climbed in. 

“Now, if I can just get that rope from around this dolphin...” Dr. D. 
groaned. 

He tugged on the rope. The dolphin began to swim. 

“The dolphin is carrying us away!” Sheena said. “Wait, dolphin! Stop!” 

The dolphin didn’t stop. It kept swimming, faster and harder. 

Dr. D. hauled himself into the boat. 

The island was a speck behind us now. We couldn’t swim back to it if we 
wanted to! The dolphin was carrying us far out to sea. 

“We might as well settle back and enjoy the ride,” Dr. D. said. “There’s 
nothing else we can do.” 


The dolphin pulled us all night long. The sea was calm that night. We slept in the 



boat again. 

When I opened my eyes, everything was gray. Misty. 

I heard the dolphin gurgling and chirping, as if it were talking to us. 

The sun was just about to come up. The ocean was covered with a thick 
blanket of fog. 

The dolphin poked its head over the side of the boat. It had slipped the rope 
off. It was free now. 

With a splash, it swam away. It quickly disappeared through the thick fog. 

I peered through the fog. I could barely see past the lifeboat. We were still 
in the middle of the ocean. But I thought I saw something nearby. Something big 
and white. 

Like a boat. 

My heart sank. 

Oh, no, I thought. I think I’ve seen this boat before. 

I shut my eyes again, wishing it would go away. 

I opened them. There it was. 

No! It can’t be! It’s too horrible! 

I shook Dr. D. “Wake up!” I cried. “Look where we are!” 

Dr. D. opened his eyes. “Huh?” my uncle muttered. “Where are we?” 

“The dolphin carried us back!” I wailed. “Back to Dr. Ritter’s boat!” 



28 


“Oh, no!” Sheena wailed. “Not again!” 

“What are we going to do?” I asked. 

“Shhh!” Dr. D. whispered. “Stay calm. They don’t know we’re here. Maybe 
we can get away somehow.” 

“Get away?” I exclaimed. “To where?” 

“I can’t stay on this raft another minute!” Sheena insisted. “I want to go 
home!” 

“That stupid dolphin!” I muttered. “I thought dolphins were supposed to be 
smart! I can’t believe it pulled us to Dr. Ritter’s boat.” 

The fog surrounded us like a thick gray curtain. It swept in and out, making 
Dr. Ritter’s boat appear to shimmer. 

The rubber raft drifted closer to the boat. I could almost touch the side of 
the bow. 

I thought I saw a word printed there. I did. The name of the boat. 

I strained to read it. I could make out the first few letters. 

C-A-S... 

Huh? 

“Dr. D.!” I cried. “It’s not Dr. Ritter’s boat. It’s our boat! It’s the 
Cassandra !” 

Dr. D. squinted. “Yes!” he cried. “You’re right, Billy!” 

We were safe! Sheena and I jumped up and danced around. 

“We’re home! We’re home! We’re home!” we sang. 

The lifeboat bounced under our feet. “Whoa!” I cried. We nearly tipped it 

over! 

“Sit down, kids,” Dr. D. said. “We’re two feet from safety. We don’t want to 
drown now.” 

We paddled the rubber raft to our boat and dragged ourselves aboard. 

I was so tired. But I couldn’t help doing another little dance on the deck of 
the Cassandra. 

Sheena slapped me five. “Nothing can stop us!” she cried happily. “Not a 
stormy night on the high seas! Not getting stranded on an empty island! 



Nothing!” 

Dr. D. laughed. “I can’t wait to take a shower and go to bed. But first—I’m 
cooking us all a big breakfast.” 

“Pancakes!” I suggested. 

“Pancakes and waffles!” Sheena cried. 

“Breakfast is going to have to wait,” a deep voice said. We all froze. 

Dr. Ritter stepped out of the cabin. “You won’t be hungry much longer,” he 
sneered. 



29 


“I can’t take this!” Sheena wailed. Tears formed in her eyes. 

“Quiet!” Dr. Ritter snapped. 

Dr. D. laid a hand on Sheena’s shoulder and shushed her. “Where are your 
assistants?” he asked Dr. Ritter. 

“That’s none of your business. I don’t need them now. I can take care of 
you myself,” Dr. Ritter replied. “You’re all very tired and weak, aren’t you? 
Even you, Dr. D. That’s what happens when you don’t eat for two days.” 

I glanced at Dr. D. It was true. He looked exhausted. 

“Go ahead,” Dr. Ritter went on. “Get back in the lifeboat. I dare you.” 

My eyes fell on the rubber boat. Dr. Ritter knew what he was doing. I 
would rather have eaten fish guts with horseradish than get back in that thing. 

“What do you want now, Ritter?” Dr. D.’s voice was tired, but angry. “Why 
did you wait here for us?” 

Dr. Ritter scowled. “I can’t let you live. I can’t let you tell the world about 
my plankton.” 

“We promised we wouldn’t tell!” Sheena cried. “Look—cross my heart and 
hope to die.” She crossed her heart and held up her hand, Girl Scout-style. 

Dr. Ritter laughed. “You’re very amusing. I’m so sorry it has to end this 
way. Really, I am.” 

The sun finally burned through the fog. I shivered. I wasn’t cold and wet 
anymore. But Dr. Ritter was giving me chills. 

“All of you—down to the lab,” Dr. Ritter ordered. “Go!” 

He forced us downstairs. Into my uncle’s lab. 

Dr. Ritter stood in front of the cabinet—the one that held the plankton 
bottles. 

“I believe these are the plankton samples you collected, Dr. Deep,” he said. 
“Am I right?” 

Dr. D. nodded. 

“Good. You’ve gathered a lot of my work. You must have been very 
interested in it.” 

“Of course I was,” Dr. D. said. “I’m a scientist.” 

“Yes,” Dr. Ritter hissed. “You’re a scientist. You want to learn more—am I 



right?” 

Dr. D. nodded slowly. 

“Excellent. You asked me earlier about the side effects of my plankton 
experiments, Dr. Deep. About the few kinks I haven’t worked out yet. I think 
now is the time to show you what they are.” 

Dr. Ritter opened the glass door of the cabinet. “When fish eat the plankton, 
they grow huge.” He pointed to the bottles of plankton lined up on the shelves. 

“You’ve already seen that, haven’t you? But what do you think happens 
when a human eats the plankton? Billy? Want to take a guess?” Dr. Ritter asked. 

I took a stab at it. “Um—they grow into giant people?” 

“Wrong!” Dr. Ritter cried. “Sheena? What do you think?” 

Sheena shrugged. “I couldn’t care less.” 

“You should care, Sheena,” Dr. Ritter said. “Because whatever happens, it’s 
going to happen to you.” 

He turned to my uncle. “Dr. Deep? Any guesses? Or have you already 
figured it out in your research?” 

“Just tell us what happens, Ritter,” Dr. D. snapped impatiently. 

“All right. I’ll tell you. When a human eats the plankton, he turns into a 
fish!” 

“Excuse me?” I cried. 

“Is this fairy-tale time?” my uncle groaned. 

Dr. Ritter ignored us. “The human becomes a fish!” he repeated. “Almost 
instantly! And that person will remain a fish—for the rest of his life.” 

“That’s impossible!” Dr. D. protested. “You’re crazy, Ritter. Let us take you 
to shore and get you some help.” 

“I’ll show you who’s crazy,” Dr. Ritter declared. “I’ll prove it to you!” 

He grabbed me by the back of the neck. 

“Hey! Let go!” I shouted. 

He didn’t say a word. He just shoved me up to the glass cabinet. He shoved 
my face close to a row of bottles. Bottle after bottle filled with murky brown 
plankton. 

“Take a bottle, Billy,” he ordered. “Any bottle.” 

He pushed me again, until my forehead nearly knocked a bottle over. Then 
he let go. 

“Go ahead,” he repeated. “Choose one.” 

“Why?” I asked. “Why do you want me to take a bottle?” 



“I’ll tell you why,” Dr. Ritter said. “Because you’re going to drink it, Billy. 
All of it.” 



30 


I stared at the bottles. 

“Take one, Billy,” Dr. Ritter insisted. “Or I’ll take one and pour it down 
your throat.” 

I had no choice. 

I reached up and picked the last one from the middle shelf. 

I stared at it. Disgusting brown and green glop. 

Not exactly the breakfast I had in mind. 

“Wait till you see this, Dr. Deep,” Dr. Ritter said. He stared at me. His eyes 
gleaming. 

“The growth hormone reacted strangely with the plankton,” Dr. Ritter 
explained. “As soon as the boy drinks it, heTl turn into a fish. It takes only a 
minute or two.” 

He grabbed the bottle from me. He opened it and handed it back. 

“Drink.” 

I lifted the bottle to my lips. 

“No!” Sheena cried. 

Dr. D. covered the lip of the bottle with one hand. 

“Wait, Billy,” he said. “This is ridiculous, Dr. Ritter. Stop this silliness 
immediately. And let us go.” 

“I can’t do that. I already explained why,” Dr. Ritter answered. 

“You need help, Dr. Ritter,” Dr. D. said. “You’re not thinking clearly. 
You’re a brilliant man. You could be a great scientist.” 

“I am a great scientist,” Dr. Ritter insisted. “I’m about to prove that to you 
right now! Drink, Billy!” 

Dr. D.’s hand still covered the bottle. 

Thank you, Dr. D., I thought. 

“You can’t be a great scientist if you hurt people,” Dr. D. insisted. “Let us 
go. We’ll get you the help you need. Then you can change the world for the 
better.” 

“You’re an idiot, Dr. Deep,” Dr. Ritter sneered. “You’ll be the next one to 
turn into a fish. Just as soon as I finish with the boy.” 



He swatted Dr. D.’s hand away from the bottle. “Drink that plankton now, 
Billy,” he commanded. “Or I’ll throw you all overboard.” 

I swished the brown liquid in the bottle. 

I gulped. 

It looked so gross. 

But what was my choice? Drown or drink... 

My hand trembled as I raised the bottle to my lips. And I drank it down. 



31 


I made a disgusted face. My whole body shook. 

Then I stood there stiffly. Every muscle tensed. Waiting. 

The others stared at me. They didn’t move, either. 

Sheena’s chin trembled. “I don’t want you to turn into a fish, Billy! Why 
did you drink it? Why didn’t you throw it on the floor?” 

“He would just pick out another bottle for me,” I replied hoarsely. I could 
still taste the liquid in my mouth. I felt it gurgling around in my stomach. 

At least a minute passed. Then another minute. 

“Okay,” Dr. Ritter said. “It should happen—now!” 

He pointed at me. I stood there. I was still a boy. 

“I don’t see any changes,” Dr. D. said. 

“Give it another minute,” Dr. Ritter insisted. “I know it works. I tried it on 
my assistant, Mel, last night. He’s swimming around out there playing tag with a 
blue marlin right now!” 

The room fell silent as we all waited for me to turn into a fish. 

My stomach felt a little queasy. Otherwise, nothing. 

I sighed and shifted my feet. 

“It’s been more than five minutes, Ritter,” Dr. D. said. “Looks like your 
plankton doesn’t work.” 

Dr. Ritter scowled furiously. “No! That’s impossible! It works! I know it 
works!” 

He grabbed me and shook me. “Fish! Turn into a fish!” 

I bumped him away. He toppled backwards. 

Dr. D. pounced on him. “Gotcha!” 

Dr. Ritter pushed him off. And grabbed a bottle of plankton. 

He raised the bottle over his head. 

“Look out, Dr. D.!” Sheena cried. 

Dr. Ritter swung the bottle. 

Dr. D. ducked. 

I snatched the bottle from Dr. Ritter’s hand. 

My uncle leaped at Dr. Ritter. Dr. Ritter dodged him and dashed out of the 



lab. 


“He’s going up on deck!” Sheena shouted. 

We raced after him. Dr. D. tackled Dr. Ritter on the deck. Dr. Ritter rolled 
away. He jumped on Dr. D. 

They wrestled around. I set the bottle of plankton down. 

“Get off him!” I yelled. I tried to pull Dr. Ritter off my uncle. 

Dr. Ritter elbowed me away. Dr. D. grabbed him. They rolled across the 
deck. 

“Dr. D.—look out!” I screamed. He was about to roll overboard. 

With a grunt, Dr. D. jumped to his feet. He dove on Dr. Ritter and pinned 
him to the deck. 

“Get a rope, Billy! Quick!” he ordered. 

I grabbed the first rope I found on the deck. “Tie him up!” Dr. D. ordered. 
“Sheena—help me hold him down.” 

Sheena took a running start and leaped on top of Dr. Ritter. 

Dr. Ritter grunted. “My stomach!” 

Sheena sat on top of him. Dr. D. pinned his arms down. I wrapped the rope 
around his wrists. 

Dr. D. had taught me some sailor’s knots the summer before. My mind 
raced, trying to remember them. 

How did it go? I thought in a panic. Over, under, around? 

Dr. Ritter squirmed under Sheena. “Hurry, Billy!” she snapped. 

“I’m trying!” I said. 

“It’s over, Ritter,” Dr. D. said. “We’re taking you to the International Sea 
Life Patrol.” 

Over, under, over? 

“No, you’re not!” Dr. Ritter cried. He bucked Sheena off. 

She tumbled to the deck. 

He wrenched his hands from the rope and shoved Dr. D. away. 

My crummy knots were useless. 

Dr. D. tried to grab him. But Dr. Ritter dove away and crawled across the 
deck. He snatched up a bottle of plankton. 

He stood and waved the bottle at us. “You’ll never turn me in!” he declared. 

Then he pulled the bottle open, tilted it over his mouth, and drank it down. 



32 


“It works!” Dr. Ritter declared. “I’ll prove it to you!” 

He tossed the bottle aside. The glass smashed on the deck. 

“You can’t fool us, Dr. Ritter,” Sheena said. “We know that stuff doesn’t 
work. We saw Billy drink it.” 

But Dr. Ritter’s body began to tremble. Quickly, his skin began to darken to 
a slivery, blue-gray. 

“Something’s happening!” Dr. D. exclaimed. 

Dr. Ritter’s skin began to flake. Then it turned scaly. It glittered in the 
sunlight. 

His body began to shrink. His clothes slid off the slick scales. His hair fell 
away. His head flattened. His whole body shrank and flattened. 

“It’s working!” I gasped. “He’s turning into a fish!” 

Dr. Ritter’s arms shriveled into fins. His legs melted together, melted into a 
fish tail. 

He flopped on the deck. One flat eye stared glassily up at us as he flapped 
his tail. 

“He’s a fish!” Sheena cried. “I don’t believe it!” 

With one great flip of his tail, the fish plopped over the side of the deck and 
into the water. 

We watched him as he dove under the surface. 

“Stop him!” I shouted. “He’s getting away! We can’t let him escape!” I 
started for my snorkeling flippers. 

But Dr. D. squeezed my shoulder. “No, Billy. It’s okay. Let him go.” 

“Huh? Why?” 

“You heard what he told us, Billy. Dr. Ritter will be a fish forever,” Dr. D. 
explained. “He can’t do anyone any harm now.” 

I stared down at the silvery fish. It splashed its tail in the water and swam 
out to sea. 

“Wow,” Sheena gasped, pressing her hands against her cheeks. 

Dr. D. put his arms around us. “I guess that adventure is over,” he sighed. “I 
was never so scared in my life.” 



Sheena and I agreed. “I’m scared—and amazed,” I told my uncle. “I’ll 
never forget the strange things we saw this week.” 

We followed Dr. D. down to help him prepare breakfast. He stopped in his 
lab. 

“What a mess,” he sighed. “I guess I’ll clean it up later.” 

Sheena walked over to the cabinet of plankton bottles. She turned to me and 
narrowed her eyes at me. “Hey, Billy—you drank a bottle of plankton too.” 

I shrugged. “Yeah. So?” 

“So why didn’t you turn into a fish like Dr. Ritter did?” she demanded. 

“You know why,” I teased. 

“I do not.” 

“Yes, you do. It’s because I’m not human. I’m superhuman.” 

She punched me in the stomach. “Come on. Tell me the real reason.” 

Dr. D. folded his arms across his chest. “Yes, Billy. Tell us. I’d be interested 
to hear this.” 

I grinned. “Well, it’s all thanks to you, Sheena.” 

“Me?” 

“Uh-huh. I was really angry after you played that trick on me. You know, 
the doll’s head in the goldfish bowl?” 

Sheena giggled. 

“Ha-ha. Hilarious. Anyway, I spent all day and all night trying to think up a 
good trick to play on you. To get you back.” 

“That’s all you ever do, Billy,” Sheena said. “What’s so different about 
that?” 

I tapped the cabinet. “I had a great idea. I took one of the plankton bottles 
and dumped the plankton out.” 

Dr. D. grimaced. “You what?” 

“Sorry, Dr. D.,” I said. “I figured you had so many, you wouldn’t miss one.” 

“I still don’t get it,” Sheena said. “Then what?” 

“I washed out the bottle. Then I poured iced tea into it,” I explained. “I was 
going to bring you in here and say, ‘Hey, Sheena! Want to see me drink 
plankton?’ Then I’d gulp down the iced tea and totally gross you out!” 

“That wouldn’t have grossed me out,” Sheena protested. 

“Yes, it would!” I insisted. “You would’ve puked all over the cabin floor!” 

“No, I wouldn’t!” 

Dr. D. interrupted us. “You planted a bottle of iced tea in the plankton 



cabinet? So when Dr. Ritter told you to choose a bottle...” 

“Right!” I cried. “I picked the bottle of iced tea!” 

Sheena laughed. She laughed so hard, she almost choked. 

“I know it’s funny,” I said. “But even I don’t think it’s that funny.” 

She hiccupped and caught her breath. “I don’t believe it,” she gasped. “You 
and I are starting to think alike, Billy.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I played the same trick on you!” she cried. “The exact same trick! I put 
iced tea in a bottle too. Watch!” 

She pulled a bottle from an end of the cabinet, ripped off the stopper, and 
gulped it down. 

Dr. D. and I gaped at her in shock. 

Sheena made a weird face. Her eyes bulged. She grabbed her stomach. 

“Oh, wow,” she groaned. “Did I drink the right bottle?” 




WEREWOLF SKIN 


Goosebumps - 60 
R.L. Stine

I stepped down from the bus and squinted into the sunlight. Shielding my eyes 
with one hand, I searched the small parking lot for Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta. 

I didn’t remember what they looked like. I hadn’t seen them since I was 
four, eight years ago. 

But the Wolf Creek bus station was so tiny. Just a little wooden shack in the 
middle of a big parking lot. I knew I couldn’t miss them. 

“How many suitcases?” the bus driver growled out of the side of his mouth. 
Despite the cold October air, he had a damp sweat stain on the back of his gray 
uniform. 

“Just one,” I said. I was the only passenger to get off at Wolf Creek. 

Across from the bus station, I saw a gas station and a one-block stretch of 
small stores. Beyond that, I could see the woods. The trees shimmered yellow 
and brown, the autumn leaves still clinging to their branches. Dry, brown leaves 
fluttered across the parking lot. 

The driver grunted as he hoisted up the sliding door to the baggage 
compartment. He pulled out a black bag. “This yours, kid?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. Thanks.” 

I shivered from a gust of cold wind. I wondered if Mom and Dad had 
packed enough warm clothes for me. They’d had to pack me up in such a hurry. 

They weren’t expecting to be called out of the country on business just 
before Halloween. They’d had to fly to France. And they’d had to find a place 
for me to stay for two weeks. Maybe longer. 

My aunt and uncle were the lucky winners! 

I adjusted the camera bag on my shoulder. I kept my camera on my lap the 
whole bus ride. I didn’t want it bouncing around in the baggage compartment. 

My camera is the most valuable thing I own. I don’t go anywhere without 
it. And I seldom let it out of my sight. 

The driver slid my suitcase over the pavement to me. He slammed shut the 
baggage compartment. Then he started back into the bus. “Someone picking you 
up?” 

“Yes,” I replied, searching for Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta again. 

A mud-splattered blue van squealed into the parking lot. The horn honked. I 



saw a hand waving to me from the passenger window. 

“There they are!” I told the bus driver. But he had already climbed back 
inside and shut the door. The bus hissed and groaned, and pulled away. 

“Alex—hi!” Aunt Marta called from the van. 

I picked up my suitcase and trotted over to them. The van screeched to a 
stop. Uncle Colin climbed out from behind the wheel. Aunt Marta came running 
from the other side. 

I didn’t remember them at all. I pictured them as young and dark-haired. 
But they were both pretty old-looking. They were both very tall and lean. As 
they hurried across the lot to me, they reminded me of two skinny grasshoppers 
with tufts of gray hair on their heads. 

Aunt Marta wrapped me in a hug. Her arms felt so bony. “Alex—it’s so 
wonderful to see you! I’m so glad you came!” she exclaimed. 

She let go quickly and backed away. “Uh-oh. I’m crushing your camera 
case!” 

I shifted it around my neck. “No, it’s a hard case,” I replied. “It’s okay.” 

Smiling, Uncle Colin shook hands with me. His wavy gray hair fluttered in 
the breeze. His cheeks were red and sort of cracked. Age lines, I guess. 

“You’re so big and grown-up,” he said, “I’m going to have to call you Mr. 
Hunter instead of Alex.” 

I laughed. “No one calls me Mr. Hunter—yet,” I told him. 

“How was the long bus ride?” he asked. 

“Bumpy,” I told him. “I don’t think the driver missed a single pothole! And 
the man next to me had the hiccups the whole way.” 

Aunt Marta chuckled. “Sounds like a fun trip.” 

Uncle Colin lowered his eyes to my camera case. “Like to take pictures, 
Alex?” 

I nodded. “Yes. I want to be a photographer someday. Just like you two.” 

Their smiles grew wider. That seemed to please them. 

But Uncle Colin’s smile faded quickly. “It’s a hard way to make a living,” 
he said. “Lots of traveling. We never stay in one place for long.” 

Aunt Marta sighed. “That’s why we haven’t seen you for so many years.” 
She hugged me again. 

“I was hoping maybe I could go out on a shoot with you,” I said. “I’ll bet 
you two could teach me a lot!” 

Uncle Colin laughed. “We’ll teach you all our secrets.” 



“You’re staying for at least two weeks,” Aunt Marta added. “So we’ll have 
plenty of time for photography lessons.” 

“Not if we spend the whole time in this parking lot!” Uncle Colin declared. 
With a groan, he hoisted my suitcase into the back of the van. 

We climbed in. And a few seconds later, we pulled away from the bus 
station, into town. 

A post office whirred past. Then a small grocery and a dry cleaner. We 
crossed a street, and thick woods surrounded us on both sides. 

“Is that all there is?” I cried. 

“Alex,” Aunt Marta replied, “you’ve just had the grand tour of Wolf 
Creek.” 

“Hope you won’t be bored in such a tiny town,” Uncle Colin added, turning 
the van sharply as the road curved through the trees. 

“No way!” I cried. “I really want to explore the woods.” 

I’m a city kid. I seldom even get to touch a tree. Going into the woods, I 
thought, will be so interesting—like visiting another planet. 

“I want to shoot a hundred rolls of film in the woods!” I declared. The van 
bumped hard, sending my head bouncing against the van roof. 

“Slow down, Colin!” Aunt Marta scolded. She turned back to me. “Your 
uncle only knows one speed —light speed.” 

“Speaking of light, we’ll show you some tricks for shooting outdoors,” 
Uncle Colin said, pressing his foot even harder on the gas pedal. 

“I’ve entered a photography contest back home,” I told them. “I want to 
snap a great Halloween photo. Something really wild to win the contest.” 

“Oh, that’s right. Halloween’s only a couple days off,” Aunt Marta said, 
glancing at my uncle. She turned back to me. “What do you want to be for 
Halloween, Alex?” 

I didn’t have to think about it. I’d already decided back home. 

“A werewolf,” I told her. 

“NO!” she screamed. 

Uncle Colin also let out a cry. 

The van plowed through a stop sign. I flew off the seat and hit the door 
hard. And stared helplessly through the bouncing windshield—as we swerved 
into the path of a roaring truck.

“AAAAAIIIII!” 

Was that me screaming? 

Our van rocked hard. I bounced again. Landed on my knees on the floor. 

Uncle Colin swerved onto the grassy shoulder. 

I saw a blur of red—and heard the truck roar past. Its horn blared angrily. 

Uncle Colin slowed to a stop under the trees. His wrinkled face had turned 
red. He swept both hands back over his thick gray hair. 

“Colin, what happened?” Aunt Marta asked softly. 

“Sorry,” he muttered. He took a deep breath. “Guess I just wasn’t 
concentrating.” 

Aunt Marta tsk-tsked. “Nearly got us killed.” She turned in the passenger 
seat to gaze at me. “Alex—you okay?” 

“Yes. I’m fine,” I told her. “I didn’t expect it to be so exciting here!” I tried 
to make a joke. But my voice came out kind of shaky. 

My camera case had fallen to the floor. I picked it up, opened it, and 
checked out the camera. It seemed okay. 

Uncle Colin shifted into Drive and pulled the van back onto the road. 
“Sorry about that,” he murmured. “I’ll be more careful. Promise.” 

“You were thinking about the Marlings again—weren’t you?” Aunt Marta 
accused him. “When Alex said werewolf, you started thinking about them, and 

55 

“Be quiet, Marta!” Uncle Colin snapped. “Don’t talk about them now. Alex 
just arrived. Do you want to scare him before we even get home?” 

“Huh? Who are the Marlings?” I demanded, leaning to the front. 

“Never mind,” Uncle Colin replied sharply. “Sit back.” 

“They’re not important,” Aunt Marta said. She turned to the windshield. 
“Hey—we’re almost home.” 

The sky seemed to darken. The old trees grew over the narrow road, their 
leaves blocking the sunlight. 

Watching the blur of red and yellow as the woods swept past, I thought 
hard. My aunt and uncle were certainly acting a little strange, I decided. I 
wondered why Uncle Colin had snapped at my aunt so angrily when she’d 



mentioned the Mailings. 

“Why do they call it Wolf Creek?” I asked. 

“Because the name Chicago was already taken!” Aunt Marta joked. 

“There used to be wolves in the woods,” Uncle Colin explained softly. 

“Used to be!” my aunt exclaimed. She lowered her voice to a whisper, but I 
could still hear her. “Why don’t you tell Alex the truth, Colin?” 

“Be quiet!” he repeated through clenched teeth. “Why do you want to scare 
him?” 

Aunt Marta turned to the passenger window. We drove on in silence for a 
while. 

The road curved, and a small circle came into view. Three houses stood 
nearly side by side on the circle. I could see the woods stretching on behind the 
houses. 

“That’s our house—in the middle,” Uncle Colin announced, pointing. 

I gazed out at it. A small, square white house on top of a neat, recently 
mowed front lawn. A long, low, ranch-style house—gray with black shutters— 
stood to the right. 

The house on the left was nearly hidden by overgrown bushes. Tall weeds 
rose up over the patchy front yard. A broken tree branch lay in the middle of the 
driveway. 

Uncle Colin pulled the van up the driveway to the middle house. “It’s small 
—but we’re not here that often,” he said. 

Aunt Marta sighed. “Always traveling.” 

She turned to me again. “There’s a nice girl who lives next door.” She 
pointed to the ranch-style house on the right. “She’s twelve. Your age, right?” 

I nodded. 

“Her name is Hannah. She’s very cute. You should make friends with her so 
you won’t be lonely.” 

Cute? 

“Any boys in the neighborhood?” I asked. 

“I don’t think so,” my aunt replied. “Sorry.” 

My uncle stopped the van at the top of the driveway. We climbed out. I 
stretched my arms over my head. All my muscles ached. I’d been sitting for over 
six hours! 

I glanced at the gray shingle house on the right. Hannah’s house. I 
wondered if she and I would become friends. 



Unde Colin unloaded my suitcase from the back of the van. 

I turned to the house on the left. What a wreck! The house was totally dark. 
Some shutters had fallen off. Part of the front porch had caved in. 

I crossed the driveway and took a few steps closer to the weird, run-down 
house. “Who lives there?” I asked my aunt. 

“Stay away from there, Alex!” Uncle Colin screamed. “Don’t ask questions 
about them! Just stay away from that house!”

“Calm down, Colin,” Aunt Marta told my uncle. “Alex isn’t going over there.” 

She turned to me. “The Marlings live in that house,” she said, lowering her 
voice to a whisper. She raised a finger to her lips. “No more questions—okay?” 

“Just stay away from there,” Uncle Colin growled. “Come help me unload 
the car.” 

I took one last glance at the run-down wreck of a house. Then I trotted over 
to help my uncle. 

It didn’t take long to unpack. Aunt Marta helped me in the guest room 
while Uncle Colin made us turkey sandwiches in the kitchen. 

My room was small and narrow, about the size of my closet back home. 
The tiny closet smelled of mothballs. But Aunt Marta said the odor would go 
away if we left the closet door and the window open. 

I crossed the tiny room to open the window. And saw that it faced the 
Marlings’ house next door. A rusted wheelbarrow tilted against the Marlings’ 
side wall. The windows were dark and coated with dust. 

I squinted into the window across from mine—and thought about Uncle 
Colin’s shouted warning. 

Why was he so worried about the Marlings? 

I raised the window and turned back to my aunt. She tucked the last of my 
T-shirts into the top dresser drawer. “The room is small. But I think you’ll be 
cozy here, Alex,” she said. “And I cleared all the junk off the desktop so you’ll 
have a place to do homework.” 

“Homework?” I uttered. 

Then I remembered. I’d promised to go to the local school for the weeks I 
stayed in Wolf Creek. 

“Hannah will take you to school Monday morning,” Aunt Marta promised. 
“She is in sixth grade too. She’ll show you around.” 

I didn’t want to think about going to a strange school. I picked up my 
camera. “I can’t wait to get into the woods and take some shots,” I told my aunt. 

“Why don’t you go after lunch?” she suggested. Straightening her gray hair, 
she led the way through the short hall to the kitchen. 

“All moved in?” Uncle Colin asked. He was pouring orange juice into three 



glasses. The sandwiches were set out on the small, round kitchen table. 

Before I could answer him, we heard a hard knock on the back door. Aunt 
Marta opened it, and a girl about my age walked in. Hannah. 

Hannah was tall and thin, an inch or two taller than me. Aunt Marta was 
right. Hannah was kind of cute. She had straight black hair, olive-green eyes, and 
a nice smile. She wore a big green sweater pulled down over black tights. 

Aunt Marta introduced us. We both said, “Hi.” 

I hate meeting new people. It’s always so awkward. 

Aunt Marta asked Hannah if she’d like a turkey sandwich. “No, thanks,” 
Hannah replied. “I already ate lunch.” 

I liked her voice. It was real low and husky. Kind of hoarse. 

“Alex just arrived on the bus,” Aunt Marta told her. “That’s why we’re 
having such a late lunch.” 

I gobbled my sandwich down in a few seconds. I guess I didn’t realize how 
hungry I was. 

“Hannah, why don’t you and Alex do some exploring in the woods?” Uncle 
Colin suggested. “He’s a city kid. You’ll have to show him what a tree is!” 

Everyone laughed. 

“I’ve seen lots of them in movies!” I joked. 

Hannah had a great, husky laugh. 

“I want to take a million photos,” I told her, grabbing my camera case. 

“You’re into photography?” Hannah asked. “Just like your aunt and uncle?” 

I nodded. 

“I hope you have color film,” Hannah said. “The fall leaves are really 
awesome now.” 

We said good-bye to Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta and headed out the front 
door. A red afternoon sun was sinking behind the trees. It made our shadows 
stretch long and skinny over the grass. 

“Hey—you’re stepping on my shadow!” Hannah protested, grinning. She 
swung her leg to make her shadow kick my shadow. 

“Ow!” I cried. I swung my fist, and my shadow slugged her shadow. 

We had a good shadow fight, punching and kicking. Finally, she stomped 
on my shadow with both of her sneakers. And I dropped to the ground, making 
my shadow slump over the grass in a dead faint. 

As I sat up, Hannah had her head tossed back, laughing. Her straight black 
hair blew wildly around her face. 



I pulled my camera from the case and quickly snapped a photo of her. 

She stopped laughing. And straightened her hair with both hands. “Hey— 
why did you do that?” 

I shrugged. “Just wanted to.” 

I climbed to my feet and raised the camera to my eye. I turned and pointed 
it toward the Marlings’ house next door. I took a few steps toward the house, 
trying to frame it in my viewfinder. 

“Hey—!” I cried out as Hannah grabbed my arm. 

“Alex—don’t take a picture!” she warned in a throaty whisper. “They’ll see 
you!” 

“So what?” I shot back. But I felt a shiver as I saw something move in the 
dark front window. 

Was someone staring out at us? 

I lowered my camera. 

“Come on, Alex.” Hannah tugged me toward the back. “Are we going into 
the woods or not?” 

I squinted up at the Marlings’ house. “Why was my uncle so upset when I 
asked about that house?” I asked Hannah. “What’s the big deal?” 

“I don’t really know,” she replied, dropping my arm. “The Marlings are 
supposed to be a weird old couple. I’ve never seen them. But... I’ve heard 
stories about them.” 

“What kind of stories?” I demanded. 

“Frightening stories,” she whispered. 

“No. Really. What kind of stories?” I insisted. 

She didn’t answer. Her olive-green eyes narrowed at the broken porch, the 
faded, stained shingles. “Let’s just stay away from there, Alex.” 

She started jogging along the side of the house toward the backyard. But I 
didn’t follow her. I crossed the driveway and stepped into the tall weeds of the 
Marlings’ front yard. 

“Alex—stop! Where are you going?” Hannah called. 

Holding my camera at my waist, I made my way quickly up to the house. 
“I’m a city kid,” I told Hannah. “I don’t scare easily.” 

“Alex, please—” Hannah pleaded. “The Marlings don’t like kids. They 
don’t like anyone coming up to their house. Please. Let’s go to the woods.” 

I stepped up carefully onto the rotting floorboards of the front porch. I 
raised my eyes to the front window. 



The reflection of the setting, red sun filled the glass. For a moment, it 
appeared that the window was on fire. 

I had to look away. 

Then, as the sunlight faded from the window-pane, I turned back—and 
gasped. 

Inside the house, the window curtains were slashed and torn. 

As if some kind of animal had clawed them, clawed them to shreds.

“Hannah—did you see this?” I called. I couldn’t take my eyes off the shredded 
curtains. 

She stood across the driveway, leaning her back against my aunt and 
uncle’s house. “I don’t want to come over there,” she said softly, folding her 
arms over her chest. 

“But the curtains—” I started. 

“I told you they’re weird,” Hannah said sharply. “And they don’t like kids 
gawking through their windows. Come on, Alex.” 

I backed away from the Marlings’ house. My shoe caught on a raised 
floorboard of the rotting porch, and I nearly fell. 

“Are we going to the woods or not?” Hannah asked impatiently. 

“Sorry.” I pulled my shoe free and followed her toward the back. “Tell me 
more about the Marlings,” I said, jogging to catch up to her. “Tell me some of 
the frightening stories you heard about them.” 

“No way,” Hannah replied in her breathy voice. 

We trotted across my aunt and uncle’s backyard. The tall yellow and red 
trees of the woods, tilting in afternoon shadows, stretched beyond the smooth 
lawn. 

“Please?” I begged. 

“Maybe in a few days, after Halloween,” Hannah replied. “After the full 
moon.” 

I followed Hannah’s gaze to the sky. A bright white moon—almost round as 
a tennis ball—rose over the trees, even though it was still daylight. 

Hannah shuddered. “I hate when the full moon comes,” she said. “I’ll be so 
happy when it’s gone.” 

“Why?” I demanded. “What’s the big deal about a full moon?” 

She gazed back at the Marlings’ house. And didn’t reply. 

We made our way through the trees. The fading sunlight filtered through the 
leaves, sending shimmering spots of gold over the ground. Our shoes crackled 
over twigs and dead leaves. 

I found a gnarled old tree, bent over like an old man. The bark was pitted 



and wrinkled like aged brown skin. Fat gray roots reached up from the dirt. 

“Wow! This is so cool\” I declared, pulling my camera from the case. 

Hannah laughed. “You really are a city kid.” 

“But—look at this tree!” I declared. “It’s like—it’s like it’s alive!” 

She laughed again. “Trees are alive, Alex!” 

“You know what I mean,” I grumbled. 

I started to snap photos of the bent, old tree. I stepped back and leaned 
against a tilted birch tree. I tried to frame the old tree so that its shape looked 
human. 

Then I moved all around the tree, photographing its creases, its wrinkles. I 
shot one slender branch that lowered itself to the ground like a weary arm. 

I dropped down to my knees and snapped the roots reaching up from the 
ground like skinny legs. 

A soft buzz made me raise my gaze. A hummingbird hovered over a 
flowering weed. I turned and tried to capture the tiny bird in my camera lens. 

But the hummingbird was too fast for me. It darted away before I could 
snap my shutter. 

I climbed to my feet. Hannah was sitting cross-legged on the ground, 
crunching dead leaves between her hands. 

“Doesn’t that hummingbird know summer is over?” I murmured. 

She stared at me blankly, as if she had forgotten I was there. “Oh. Sorry, 
Alex. I didn’t see it.” She climbed to her feet. 

“What happens if you keep going straight?” I asked, pointing deeper into 
the woods. 

“You come to Wolf Creek,” Hannah replied. “I’ll show you the creek next 
time. But we’d better get going. We should get out of the woods before the sun 
goes down.” 

I suddenly thought of the wolves Uncle Colin had told me about. The 
wolves that gave Wolf Creek its name. 

“The wolves that used to live here in these woods,” I said. “They’re all 
gone—right?” 

Hannah nodded. “Yes. They’re gone.” 

And then a shrill howl rose up—so close, so close behind me. The high, 
shrill wail of a wolf. 

And I opened my mouth in a terrified scream.

I stumbled back against the birch tree. My camera banged against the trunk, but I 
didn’t drop it. 

“Hannah—?” I choked out. Her eyes were wide with surprise. 

But before she could reply, two boys burst out from behind a tall evergreen 
shrub. They tossed back their heads and howled like wolves. 

“Hey —you guys!” Hannah exclaimed, making a disgusted face. 

They were both short and thin, both with straight black hair and dark brown 
eyes. They finished their howls, then gazed at me, gazed at me hungrily, like 
wolves. 

“Did we scare you?” one of them teased, his dark eyes flashing excitedly. 
He wore a dark brown sweater pulled down over black denim jeans. He had a 
long purple wool muffler wrapped around his neck. 

“You two always scare me!” Hannah joked. “Your faces give me 
nightmares!” 

The other boy wore a baggy gray sweatshirt and baggy khakis that dragged 
on the ground. He tossed back his head and let out another shrill wolf howl. 

Hannah turned to me. “They’re in my class,” she explained. “That one is 
Sean Kiner.” She pointed to the boy with the purple muffler. “And he’s Arjun 
Khosla.” 

“Arjun?” I struggled with the name. 

“It’s Indian,” he explained. 

“Hannah told us you were coming,” Sean said, grinning. 

“You’re a city kid, right?” Arjun asked. 

“Well, yeah. Cleveland,” I murmured. 

“So how do you like Wolf Creek?” Arjun asked. It didn’t sound like a 
question. It sounded like a challenge. 

They both stared at me with their dark eyes, studying me as if I were some 
kind of weird fungus. 

“I—I just got here,” I stammered. 

They exchanged glances. “There are some things you should know about 
the woods,” Sean said. 

“Like what?” I asked. 



He pointed to my feet. “Like you shouldn’t stand in a big clump of poison 

ivy!” 

“Huh?” I jumped back. And stared at the ground. 

They both laughed. 

There wasn’t any poison ivy. 

“You guys are about as funny as dog puke,” Hannah sneered. 

“You ought to know. You eat it for breakfast!” Sean replied. 

He and Arjun laughed and slapped each other a high five. 

Hannah sighed. “Remind me to laugh later,” she muttered, rolling her eyes. 
For some reason, that started the two boys howling again. 

When they stopped, Sean reached for my camera. “Can I see it?” 

“Well...” I pulled back. “It’s a very expensive camera,” I told him. “I really 
don’t like anyone else touching it.” 

“Ooooh. Expensive!” he teased. “Is it cardboard? Let me see it!” He 
grabbed for it again. 

“Take my picture,” Arjun demanded. He pulled his lips apart with two 
fingers and stuck out his tongue. 

“That’s an improvement!” Hannah told him. 

“Take my picture!” Arjun repeated. 

“Give Alex a break,” Hannah snapped. “Get out of his face, you two.” 

Arjun pretended to be hurt. “Why won’t he take my picture?” 

“Because he doesn’t take animal photos!” Hannah sneered. 

Sean laughed—and snatched the camera from my hands. 

“Hey—come on!” I pleaded. I made a grab for it and missed. 

Sean tossed the camera to Arjun. Arjun raised it and pretended to snap 
Hannah’s photo. “Your face cracked the lens!” he exclaimed. 

“I’m going to crack your face!” Hannah threatened. 

“It’s a really expensive camera,” I repeated. “If anything happens to it—” 
Hannah swiped the camera out of Arjun’s hands and handed it back to me. 

I cradled it in my arms. “Thanks.” 

The two boys moved toward me menacingly. Their dark eyes gleamed. 
Again, watching them approach, their faces so hard, their eyes so cold, I thought 
of wild animals. 

“Leave him alone,” Hannah scolded. 

“We’re just goofing,” Arjun replied. “We weren’t going to hurt the camera.” 



“Yeah. We’re just kidding around,” Sean added. “What’s your problem?” 

“No problem,” I replied, still cradling the camera. 

Arjun raised his eyes to the darkening sky. Through the trees I could see 
only gray. “It’s getting kind of late,” Arjun murmured. 

Sean’s smile faded. “Let’s get out of here.” His eyes darted around the 
woods. Shadows deepened, and the air grew colder. 

“They say some kind of wild creatures are loose in the woods,” Arjun said 
softly. 

“Arjun—give us a break,” Hannah groaned, rolling her eyes. 

“No. Really,” Arjun insisted. “Some kind of creature tore off a deer’s head. 
Tore it clean off.” 

“We saw it,” Sean reported. His dark eyes glowed excitedly in the dimming 
light. “It was so gross!” 

“The deer’s eyes stared up at us,” Arjun added. “And bugs crawled out of 
its open neck.” 

“Yuck!” Hannah exclaimed, covering her mouth with one hand. “You’re 
making this up—right?” 

“No. I’m not.” Sean glanced up at the moon. 

“It’s almost a full moon. The full moon makes all the strange creatures 
come out of hiding,” he continued, speaking so softly, his voice just above a 
whisper. “Especially at Halloween. And the moon will be completely full that 
night.” 

I shivered. The back of my neck tingled. I suddenly felt cold all over. 

Was it the wind? Or Sean’s frightening words? 

I pictured the deer head lying on the ground. 

Pictured the shiny black eyes staring up blankly, lifelessly. 

“What are you going to be for Halloween?” Arjun asked Hannah. 

She shrugged. “I don’t know. I haven’t decided yet.” 

He turned to me. “Do you know what you want to be, Alex?” 

I nodded. “Yeah. I want to be a werewolf.” 

Arjun uttered a near-silent gasp. The two boys exchanged glances. 

Their smiles faded. Their faces turned solemn. 

“What’s wrong?” I asked. 

No reply. 

“Hey—what’s wrong?” I repeated. 

Arjun lowered his gaze to the ground. “We have enough werewolves in 



Wolf Creek,” he murmured. 

“What do you mean?” I cried. “Come on, guys—what do you mean by 
that?” 

But they didn’t answer. 

Instead, they turned and vanished into the woods.

Aunt Marta invited Hannah to stay for dinner. The four of us squeezed around 
the small kitchen table and spooned up big bowls of steaming chicken soup. 

“You make the best soup!” Hannah told my aunt. 

Aunt Marta smiled. A little broth dripped down her chin. She reached for 
her napkin. “Thank you, Hannah. I just throw everything in it I can find.” 

“Sorry we were late for dinner,” I said. “I lost track of time. I didn’t want to 
leave the woods. It was so interesting.” 

Uncle Colin’s eyes moved to the kitchen window. He stared up at the rising 
moon. Then he lowered his gaze to the Marlings’ house next door. 

“I photographed an awesome-looking tree,” I told him. “It was wrinkled 
and bent over like an old man.” 

Uncle Colin didn’t reply. His eyes were still focused out the window. 

“Colin—Alex is talking to you,” Aunt Marta scolded. 

“Huh? Oh.” He turned back to the table, shaking his head as if shaking 
away his thoughts. “Sorry. What were you saying?” 

I told him again about the old tree. 

“I’ll help you develop those shots,” he offered. “Maybe tomorrow. I set up a 
darkroom in the little bathroom in the attic. We really need a bigger house. 
Especially with all the work we’ve been doing lately.” 

“What are you photographing now?” I asked. 

“Creatures of the night,” he replied. His eyes wandered to the window 
again. I followed his gaze to the Marlings’ back window. Totally dark. 

“We’re photographing nocturnal animals,” Aunt Marta explained. “Animals 
that come out only at night.” 

“You mean like owls?” Hannah asked. 

Aunt Marta nodded. “We’ve found some wonderful owls in the woods— 
haven’t we, Colin?” 

Uncle Colin turned back from the window. Silvery light from the full moon 
washed over the windowpane. “The night creatures don’t like to be 
photographed,” he said, spooning up a carrot and chewing it slowly. “They are 
very private.” 

“Sometimes we wait in one spot for hours,” my aunt added. “Waiting for a 



creature to poke its head up from its hole in the ground.” 

“Can I come with you one night?” I asked eagerly. “I can be real quiet. 
Really.” 

Uncle Colin swallowed a chunk of chicken. “That’s a fine idea,” he said. 
But then his expression grew solemn. And he added, “Maybe after Halloween.” 

I turned and saw Aunt Marta staring out at the Marlings’ house. “The moon 
is still low,” she said thoughtfully. “But it’s so bright tonight.” 

“Almost like daylight out there,” Uncle Colin said. What was that 
expression that quickly passed over his face? Was it fear ? 

My aunt and uncle are both acting so weird tonight, I decided. So nervous. 

Why do they keep staring out the window? What do they expect to see at 
the Marlings’ house? 

I couldn’t hold it in any longer. “Is everything okay?” I asked them. 

“Okay?” Uncle Colin narrowed his eyes at me. “I guess...” 

“Are you two thinking about your Halloween costumes?” Aunt Marta 
demanded, changing the subject. 

“I think I’m going to be a pirate again this year,” Hannah replied. She 
finished her chocolate milk and licked the chocolate syrup on the edge of the 
glass. “You know. I’ll wrap a bandanna around my head and wear a patch over 
one eye.” 

“Colin and I might have some funny old clothes you can wear,” Aunt Marta 
offered. She turned to me. “How about you, Alex?” 

I still wanted to be a werewolf. But I remembered the last time I’d told that 
to my aunt and uncle. Uncle Colin had nearly cracked up the car! 

So I smiled and quietly told them, “Maybe I’ll be a pirate too.” 

I spooned up the last of my soup. 

I had no way of knowing that in a few hours, when the moon rose to its 
peak in the sky, I’d be nearly face-to-face with a real werewolf.

After Hannah went home, I made my way to my little bedroom. I straightened up 
a bit, shoving clothes into the dresser drawers. 

I’m not the neatest person in the world. Let’s face it—I’m a total slob. But I 
knew if I let the clutter pile up in this tiny room, I’d never find anything. 

I sat down at the desk and wrote a short letter to Mom and Dad. I told them 
everything was fine. I wrote that I’d have at least a thousand great photographs 
to show them when they came home from France. 

When I finished addressing the letter, I wasn’t feeling sleepy. But I decided 
I should probably go to bed, anyway. 

I started to the closet to find my pajamas. But I stopped at the window. 

And stared out at a pale orange light. 

Alight in a side window of the Marlings’ house! 

The light shimmered between two tilting trees, their leaves vibrating in the 
wind. A pale orange rectangle of light on the bottom floor of the house, near the 
back. 

A bedroom window? 

I pressed closer to the glass and squinted hard into the darkness. Squinted 
into the dim rectangle of orange. 

Was I about to see one of the Marlings? I held my breath and waited. 

I didn’t have to wait long. 

I let out a gasp as a silhouette crossed the window next door. A gray figure 
caught in the rectangle of orange. 

Was it a man? 

I couldn’t tell. 

The silhouette moved. It’s an animal, I realized. 

No. A man. 

Mr. Marling? 

I pressed against the glass, squinting hard. Was it a large dog? A man? I 
couldn’t see clearly. 

The silhouette moved away from the window. 

And then I heard a long, high animal wail. 



The sound floated out through the window next door. Floated across the 
narrow space between our houses. 

The high, animal howl swept into my room. Swirled around me. 

Such an ugly, frightening sound. Half-human, half-animal. A cry I had 
never heard before. 

A chill rolled down my back. And then another. 

Another howl made me gasp. 

I stared out as the silhouette returned to the window. A creature with its 
head tilted back. Its jaws open, uttering such frightening animal cries. 

I’ve got to take a picture, I told myself. I’ve got to photograph the howling 
silhouette. 

I spun away from the window. Dove across the tiny room to the dresser. 

Reached for my camera. 

My camera? 

It was gone. 



8 


“No—!” I uttered a shocked cry. 

My hands fumbled frantically over the desktop. 

I left the camera there. I knew I had. 

But no. No camera. 

My eyes swept around the room. I had just straightened up. Everything was 
in place. The desktop. The dresser. 

No camera. No camera. 

I dropped to my knees and searched under the bed. 

No camera. 

I crawled over to the closet. Pulled open the door. And searched the closet 
floor. 

As I searched, another wolf howl burst into my room. Higher. Shriller. 

And then I heard two howls together. The sirenlike wails blending in a 
strange, sour harmony. 

Was it Mr. and Mrs. Marling? 

As I climbed to my feet, I heard a scraping sound. Wood against wood. 

The sound of a window opening. 

I heard a heavy THUD. 

Feet landing hard on the ground. 

And then I heard low grunts. Heavy, thudding footsteps. 

Footsteps right outside my room! 

I dove back to the window. Breathlessly, my heart pounding, I stared out. 

Too late. 

No one out there now. 

All dark. The orange light gone from the Marlings’ window. The house 
completely covered in black again. 

The trees shaking, black against the blue-black sky. The leaves silvery, 
shimmering under the bright light of the moon. 

I stared out there for a long moment, waiting for my heart to stop racing. 
Fistening for the high howls, the heavy, thudding footsteps. 

Silence now. 



My camera... 

I forced myself to turn away from the window. I hurried out of the room 
and down the short hall to the living room. Did I leave the camera case here 
when Hannah and I returned from the woods? 

No. No sign of it. 

I checked the kitchen. Not there, either. 

“Aunt Marta! Uncle Colin!” I called them. My voice came out tinier than 
I’d planned. 

I ran back down the hall. Past my room. Past the bathroom and the linen 
closet. Their room stood at the end. “Have you seen my camera anywhere?” I 
cried. 

I shoved open the door to their bedroom. 

Dark in there. Dark and empty. 

I could smell Aunt Marta’s flowery perfume. And the sharp odor of photo- 
developing fluid. 

They’ve gone out to the woods to photograph animals, I realized. 

I’m all alone here. 

I took a deep breath and held it. Calm down, Alex, I instructed myself. 
You’re perfectly okay. You’re perfectly safe. 

You will find your camera as soon as you get calm. It’s probably right out in 
plain sight. But you’re so crazy and pumped up, you can’t see it. Just calm 
down! 

I took another long, deep breath. I was starting to feel calmer. 

I closed my aunt and uncle’s bedroom door and started back down the hall. 

I was halfway to my room when I heard the soft, scraping sound. 

And then the thud of footsteps. 

I froze. And listened. 

More footsteps. Heavy thuds. 

Where were they coming from? 

Overhead? 

Yes. 

I peered up at the low ceiling. 

Another scraping sound. More thudding footsteps. They’re in the attic! I 
realized. Whatever those howling creatures are— they’re in the house! 



9 


I dropped back against the wall. My whole body shook. 

I swallowed hard. And listened to the heavy footsteps above my head. 

I’ve got to get out of here! I told myself. I’ve got to get out of this house! 

I’ve got to tell Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta! 

But my legs felt like Jell-O. I didn’t know if I could walk. 

I took a shaky step. Then another. 

And then I heard a new sound from upstairs. 

I stopped and listened. 

Humming? Was someone humming? 

With a burst of energy, I grabbed the door to the attic. I pulled it open and 
shouted up the stairs, “Who’s up there? Who is it?” 

“It’s me, Alex!” a familiar voice called down. 

“Hannah—?” I choked out. I stared up to the attic. “Wh-what are you doing 
up there?” 

“Didn’t your aunt tell you I came back?” Hannah called. 

“No, she didn’t,” I replied. 

“She said she had some old clothes up here that might make a good 
costume. So I came back to check it out.” 

Her head appeared at the top of the stairs. “Why do you sound so weird?” 

“I—I thought—” I began. But the words caught in my throat. 

I started up the stairs. 

“No—!” Hannah cried. “Don’t come up!” 

I stopped on the third step. “How come?” I called. 

“I’m not dressed. I’m trying on stuff,” she explained. She smiled down at 
me. “Besides, I want to surprise you. There’s some awesome old stuff up here. 
Your aunt and uncle must have looked really weird when they were young.” 

Her head disappeared from view. I could hear the rustle of clothes up there. 

I backed down the stairs. “Hey—do you know where my camera is?” I 
asked. “I’ve looked all over the house, and—” 

“Oh, no!” Hannah groaned. Her head appeared again. This time she wasn’t 
smiling. 



“What?” I called up to her. 

“Your camera, Alex. Do you think maybe you left it in the woods?” 

I gasped. “I don’t know. I thought...” My voice trailed off. I had a sick, 
heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach. 

“You had it when Sean and Arjun left,” Hannah said. “But when we came 
back to the house, I don’t remember you carrying it.” 

“Oh, wow!” I shook my head. “I’ve got to go get it, Hannah. I can’t leave it 
overnight in the woods.” 

“No —/” she cried. “Alex, listen to me. You can’t go out there.” 

“I have to!” I cried. 

“But the woods aren’t safe at night,” she protested. “They really aren’t 
safe.” 

I turned away and ran down the hall. I pulled on my jacket and found a 
flashlight on the floor of the hall closet. I tested it a few times. The light was 
steady and bright. 

“I’ll be back in a few minutes,” I shouted up to Hannah. 

“No—please, Alex!” I heard her call down. “Listen to me! Don’t go into the 
woods tonight! Wait for me to get dressed. Just wait for me—okay?” 

But I couldn’t leave my camera out there to be ruined. 

I closed the front door behind me and stepped out into the light of the 


moon. 



10 


I began trotting along the side of the house toward the backyard. Heavy black 
clouds covered the moon. The night air felt colder than I’d thought. Wet. I 
zipped my down jacket as I ran. 

I glanced at the Marlings’ house as I jogged past. Nothing to see there. The 
back window had been left wide open. But the house was completely dark. Not a 
light on anywhere. 

The grass was slick and wet from a heavy dew. I felt a splash of cold on my 
forehead. 

A raindrop? 

I groaned as I thought of my camera, sitting out in the woods. It was such 
an expensive camera. I prayed I could find it before it started to rain. 

Several tiny animals scampered silently past my feet. 

I stopped. 

No. Not animals. Fat, dead leaves. They scuttled over the dark grass, 
pushed by swirls of wind. 

I lowered my head under a tree branch and entered the woods at the back of 
the yard. The old trees shivered and creaked. 

The steady WHOO of an owl, far in the distance, made me think of my aunt 
and uncle. They were here with their cameras somewhere in the woods. I 
wondered if I would run into them. 

I followed the twisting path through the trees. Another raindrop fell heavily 
on the top of my head. Rain spattered the ground. 

I stopped when the bent tree came into view. The tree I had photographed 
with Hannah that afternoon. I played my flashlight over its curved shape. 

“At least I’m heading in the right direction,” I said out loud. 

I stepped over a fallen tree branch and moved deeper into the woods. The 
trees began to hiss, the leaves shaking in the rising wind. I could still hear the 
owl’s steady WHOO WHOO in the distance. 

My flashlight dimmed, then brightened again. Its thin circle of light made a 
path for me between the trees. 

“All right!” 

I cried out when the light swept over my camera case. I had set it down on a 



flat tree stump. How could I have forgotten it there? 

With another happy cry, I picked it up. I actually felt like hugging it. I was 
so happy to have it back. I checked it out carefully, turning it under the 
flashlight. 

I wiped away the few raindrops that clung to the top. Then, cradling it 
under one arm, I started back to the house. 

The rain had stopped, at least for a moment. I started to hum happily. I 
wanted to skip all the way home! 

The camera meant more to me than anything. I promised myself I’d never 
leave it anywhere again. 

I stopped humming when I heard the angry sound. 

An animal snarl. A fierce, throaty roar. 

I dropped the flashlight. 

The creature roared again. 

Where was it? Where was it coming from? 

Right behind me! 



11 


I bent and grabbed up the flashlight. My knees suddenly felt weak. A cold wave 
of panic swept over my body. 

I heard loud animal grunts. Another angry snarl. 

I forced myself to move. I had to get away from here. 

A clump of fat shrubs rose up in front of me. Clutching my camera case, I 
darted behind them. And dropped to my knees. 

Hidden behind the bushes, I struggled to catch my breath. To stop my heart 
from thudding so hard in my chest. 

I couldn’t see around the fat leaves of the bush. But I could hear the 
animal’s grunts and growls. I ducked lower, hoping I was completely out of 
view. 

Hoping it couldn’t smell me. 

And then I heard the crash of heavy feet on the ground. A high wail of 
anger, like a cry of attack. 

A frightened bleat rose up. So high and tiny. A terrified cry—cut off 
quickly. 

Snapped off. 

Leaning into the shrub, my legs trembling, my whole body shaking, I heard 
a struggle. 

So close. So close, I felt I could stand up—reach out—and touch the 
attacker and his prey. 

So close, I heard every grunt, every frightened cry. 

A thud. A growl. Another tiny, helpless bleat. 

A loud ripping sound. 

Wet chewing. The slap of jaws. More rapid chewing. An animal burp. 
Another ripping sound. 

I shut my eyes, picturing what was happening right in front of me. 

I heard a thud. Then silence. 

The hiss of the wind seemed to grow louder. 

A hiss... then silence. 

I opened my eyes. 



I stood up shakily. 

And heard heavy footsteps. Twigs and leaves crackling under heavy feet. 
The footsteps approaching rapidly. Coming my way. 

Coming for me. The creature—the hungry creature—was moving toward 
me. 

“Ohhhh.” A low cry of terror escaped my throat. 

Gripping the camera case tightly, I spun away from the clump of shrubs. 
And started to run. 

I heard animal grunts behind me. Heavy-breathing pants. 

I didn’t glance back. 

I ran deeper into the woods. I thought I heard the splash and trickle of a 
creek on my right. Wolf Creek? I didn’t stop to see. 

A branch scratched my cheek as I scrambled past it. Pain shot over my face. 
I raised one arm to shield myself as I ran. 

Ran blindly. Ran through the darkness. 

Where was the flashlight? 

Oh, no. I’d left it behind in the bushes. 

It was of no use to me, anyway. I was running too fast to keep to the path. 

I lowered my shoulder and pushed my way through a patch of tall reeds. 
They snapped back, slapping me wetly as I shot through them. 

My foot caught on a half-buried rock. I slid off it, somehow keeping my 
balance. 

I leaped over an upraised tree root—and kept running. 

Over the harsh gasps of my breath, I listened for the heavy, thudding 
footsteps behind me. The animal growls. 

Was the creature still chasing me? 

I grabbed a smooth, damp tree trunk and stopped. I hugged the trunk, 
struggling to keep my legs from collapsing, struggling to catch my breath. 

I turned and gazed back. 

Nothing there. 

No growls. No grunts. No bang of heavy feet on the ground. 

I sucked in breath after breath. My lungs burned. My mouth felt so dry, I 
couldn’t swallow. 

I’m okay, I told myself. I’m safe—for now. 

I gazed into the deep darkness. 

And the creature hit me from behind. 



12 


“Hunh—!” 

I uttered a startled groan. And dropped to the ground. 

I spun around to face my attacker. 

No one there. 

Nothing. 

“Huh?” A shocked cry escaped my lips. 

I started to scramble to my feet—and saw what had hit the back of my head. 
A bird’s nest. A dried-up, broken bird’s nest. It must have fallen from a tree 
limb above my head. Probably shaken loose by the gusts of wind. 

“Oh, wow.” I shook twigs from my hair. Then, cradling the camera case 
under my arm, I gazed around. 

Where was I? 

Trees up ahead slanted as if leaning against each other. A low mound of 
rocks stood at the edge of a ridge of tall reeds. 

I’m lost, I realized. 

I gazed up at the sky. No moon. The heavy rain clouds covered the moon 
and stars. 

How do I get back? I squinted into the darkness, searching for the path. 
Searching for anything I might recognize. 

Nothing. 

If I could find the creek, maybe I could find the spot where I found my 
camera, I decided. 

But which direction was the creek? 

I was completely turned around. 

I shivered. A cold raindrop spattered on the shoulder of my jacket. 

I jumped. That bird’s nest had made me terrified of things falling from the 

sky! 

What should I do? 

My mind whirred frantically with ideas. 

Should I call out for help? Shout to my aunt and uncle? Maybe if I called 
loud enough, they would hear me. 



But, no. If I shout, the animal—the snarling creature—will hear me first. 

Was it still searching for me? Was it still nearby? 

I decided I’d better not call for help. 

What should I do? What ? 

Start walking in one direction? And just keep going no matter what? 

No. I remembered a book I’d read where a guy was lost in the desert. And 
he tried walking in a straight line. And he just made circles. He went around and 
around and didn’t even realize it until he saw his own footprints in the sand! 

Maybe I should wait until the sun comes up, I decided. I’ll never find my 
way in this darkness. When it’s daylight, I’ll have a much better chance. 

I didn’t like the idea of spending the night in the woods. But waiting here 
until I could see where I was going seemed like a good idea. 

But then I heard a clattering sound. And felt the rain start to pound down 
hard. A freezing rain, swept by gusting wind. 

I can’t stay here, I realized. 

I have to get back to the house. 

I walked and walked, trying to retrace my steps. I sighed with relief when I 
finally came to the clump of bushes where I’d hid. I found the flashlight and 
gripped it tightly in my free hand. 

I took a guess on which direction to go next. 

Ducking my head against the rain, I started to walk again. 

Less than a minute later, I stumbled over something. 

Something soft. 

I landed on my knees. Turned back to see what I had tripped over. 

And let out a cry of horror. 



13 


The flashlight trembled in my hand. The quivering light revealed an ugly picture. 

I gaped down at an animal body. No. Two. 

Two animals. 

What were they? I couldn’t tell. They’d been clawed to pieces. 

Completely ripped apart. 

I remembered the ripping sounds I’d heard. The sounds of these animals 
being torn apart. My stomach lurched. 

What kind of animal did this? 

What kind of animal was strong enough to tear other creatures apart? 

A chill ran down my back. 

I pulled myself to my feet. I forced myself to look away. 

The rain poured down. I shielded my camera case under my jacket—and 
started to run again. 

I had to get away from that ugly sight. Would I ever be able to forget it? 

The wind whipped the rain around me. I felt as if I were running through 
ocean waves. But I couldn’t stop. 

My fear kept me running. 

That fierce creature still lurked in these woods. Still growled and hunted, 
somewhere nearby. 

My sneakers were soaked. I slipped and slid in the soft mud. 

I’m not sure how long I ran. I stopped when I nearly ran right into the 
creek. Pounded by the rain, it splashed over its low bank. 

I turned and followed it, feeling a little more confident. After a while, I 
spotted a narrow path cut through the tilting trees. 

I turned onto the path. Would it lead me out of the woods? I had to try it. 

The rain slowed to a soft patter. My sneakers sank deep into the mud as I 
trotted along the curving path. 

Soon I came to the bent, old-man tree. 

“Yes!” I cried out loud. “Yes!” I waved my fist triumphantly in the air. I 
was almost home. 

I picked up my pace. A few minutes later, I burst out of the woods, into my 



aunt and uncle’s backyard. 

I was so happy! I wanted to fly! 

I couldn’t wait to get into the warm house. To pull off my soaked clothes 
and get into something dry. 

But I stopped in the middle of the backyard. 

And stared into the circle of yellow light from my flashlight. 

Stared down at the strange footprints in the wet grass. 

Deep, rutted footprints heading into the Marlings’ backyard. 

I bent into the light to see them better. They weren’t human footprints. They 
were too long and too wide and shaped differently from human feet or shoes. 

Animal footprints. 

Keeping the beam of light in front of me, I trailed the footprints, following 
them over the grass. 

Across the Marlings’ weed-choked backyard. 

I stopped when I saw where the strange footprints led. 

Right up to the Marlings’ open bedroom window. 



14 


When I came into the kitchen for breakfast the next morning, Aunt Marta was on 
the phone. She stood at the counter with her back to me. But she turned as I said 
good morning to my uncle, and flashed me an angry look. 

“Yes, I understand,” she said into the phone. “Well, it won’t happen again.” 

I took my place at the table beside Uncle Colin. He sipped from a white 
coffee mug, his eyes on Aunt Marta. 

“It won’t happen again,” my aunt repeated into the phone. She frowned. 
“I’ll make sure he stays away. No. He wasn’t spying on you, Mr. Marling.” 

So that’s who she was talking to. 

Uncle Colin shook his head unhappily. “I warned you not to go near that 
place, Alex,” he said. “We don’t need those people calling over here.” 

“Sorry,” I murmured. “But—” 

I wanted to tell him about last night, about everything that had happened to 
me and everything I’d seen. 

But he raised a finger to his lips, motioning for me to be silent while my 
aunt was on the phone. 

“No. My nephew wasn’t taking pictures of your house, Mr. Marling,” Aunt 
Marta continued. She rolled her eyes. “I promise. He won’t bother you again. I’ll 
talk to him right now. Yes. Okay. Good-bye.” 

She set down the receiver and turned to Uncle Colin with a sigh. “Those 
people,” she murmured. 

“We have to be careful,” Uncle Colin replied, narrowing his eyes at me. 
“We don’t want to get them worked up.” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. “I saw things—” 

“They saw you, Alex,” my aunt interrupted. “They saw you prowling 
around their house late last night. They are very angry about it.” 

She poured herself a mug of coffee and came over to the table. She sat 
down and swept a strand of gray hair off her forehead. 

“What were you doing outside last night?” my uncle asked. 

“I’m really sorry. But I had no choice. I left my camera out in the woods,” I 
explained. “I had to run out and get it. I couldn’t leave it out all night— 
especially with the rain.” 



“But you didn’t have to go near the Marlings’ house—did you?” Aunt 
Marta demanded. 

“I—I heard animal howls from inside their house!” I blurted out. “And I 
saw strange footprints going up to the bedroom window at the side.” 

Unde Colin nodded calmly. He took a long sip of coffee. “The footprints 
were probably from their dogs,” he said, glancing at Aunt Marta. 

“Dogs?” I cried. 

They both nodded. “They have two huge German shepherds,” my aunt 
explained. “Mean as they come.” 

“And as big as wolves,” Uncle Colin added, shaking his head. He reached 
for a slice of toast and began to butter it. 

I sighed. I felt a little better. 

Two German shepherds. That explained the howls and the footprints in the 
wet grass. 

“Are you ready for school?” Aunt Marta asked. “Hannah will be here any 
minute.” 

“I’m almost ready,” I replied. I gulped down a glass of orange juice. “When 
I was in the woods last night...” I started. 

They both stared at me. 

“I saw some animals that got ripped up. I mean, killed.” 

Uncle Colin nodded. “The woods are dangerous at night,” he said softly. 

“We really don’t want you out there at night, Alex,” Aunt Marta said. She 
pulled a piece of lint off the shoulder of my T-shirt. Then she tenderly brushed 
my hair back with her hand. “Promise us you won’t go again.” 

“Promise,” I murmured. 

“And promise that you’ll stay away from the Marlings,” my uncle added. 

Before I could reply, the doorbell rang. Hannah came into the kitchen, 
weighted down under a bulging backpack. “Ready?” she asked. 

I nodded and shoved my chair back from the table. “Yeah. I guess I’m 
ready,” I told her. “This is so weird. Going to someone else’s school.” 

“You’ll like my teacher, Mr. Shein,” Hannah replied. “He’s very interesting. 
And he’s really nice.” 

I grabbed my backpack and my jacket. We said good-bye to my aunt and 
uncle and headed out the front door. 

I glanced at the Marlings’ house as we made our way to the street. The 
bedroom window at the side had been closed, I saw. The house was dark as 



always. 

“Did you find your camera?” Hannah asked. 

I nodded. “Yeah. But it wasn’t easy.” I told her about my scary adventures. 

She tsk-tsked. “I warned you, Alex,” she said. “You wouldn’t catch me in 
the woods after dark.” 

A yellow school bus rumbled past. Some kids in the bus called out the 
window to Hannah. She waved back to them. 

The morning sun still floated low in the sky. A silvery frost clung to the 
lawns. The air felt crisp and cold. 

“One more block to school,” Hannah said. “Are you nervous?” 

I didn’t answer. I was thinking about the Marlings. I told Hannah about the 
howls I’d heard inside their house. “Uncle Colin says they have two German 
shepherds. Really big and really mean,” I told her. 

“No, they don’t,” Hannah replied sharply. 

I stopped walking. “Excuse me?” I cried. 

“The Marlings don’t have any dogs,” she repeated. “I’ve lived here as long 
as they have, and I’ve never seen them.” 

“Then why did my uncle tell me that?” I demanded. 

“So you won’t be scared,” Hannah replied. 

“I—I don’t understand,” I stammered. “If the Marlings don’t have dogs, 
what made those weird footprints outside their window?” 

Hannah shook her head. Her olive-green eyes locked onto mine. “Alex, 
don’t you get it?” she cried. “Haven’t you figured it out yet?” 

“Figured what out?” I asked. 

“The Marlings are werewolves!” Hannah declared. 



15 


Why is everyone in Wolf Creek obsessed with werewolves? I wondered. 

I laughed at Hannah and teased her the rest of the walk to school. I mean, 
how could anyone actually believe in werewolves today? 

“You’re only trying to scare me,” I told her. “But I don’t scare easily— 
remember? I saw one of the German shepherds. It was howling in the Marlings’ 
window.” 

Hannah shrugged. “Believe what you want to believe,” she murmured. 

“Don’t try to scare me with werewolves anymore,” I told her. 

But I had a surprise when we arrived at school. Even Mr. Shein, the sixth- 
grade teacher, wanted to talk about werewolves all morning! 

He was about forty, short, and chubby, with thinning brown hair and thick 
black eyeglasses perched on his round pink face. He wore a yellow sweater that 
made him resemble a ripe pear. 

But Hannah was right. He was very nice. Very friendly. He welcomed me 
eagerly and introduced me to the other sixth graders, and really made me feel at 
home. 

He assigned me a seat near the door in back. Hannah sat in the front row. 

I spotted Sean and Arjun near the windows on the other side of the 
classroom. They nodded, but didn’t say hi or anything. 

They both looked rumpled and kind of tired. Their baggy clothes were very 
wrinkled. Their hair was wild. They look as if they’d been up all night, I 
thought. 

Weird thought... 

After taking attendance and making a few announcements, Mr. Shein sat on 
the edge of his desk. His eyes traveled around the room. He waited for us to 
settle down. 

“Does anyone know what the study of lycanthropy is?” he asked. Behind 
his glasses, his dark eyes glowed. 

I had never heard the word. But to my surprise, several hands shot up. He 
called on Arjun. 

“It’s about people changing into wolves,” Arjun said. 

“Werewolves!” Sean exclaimed. 



Mr. Shein nodded. “Yes. Werewolves,” he repeated. “That’s what 
lycanthropy is the study of.” He cleared his throat. “Since Halloween comes later 
this week, I thought we might spend some time discussing lycanthropy.” 

“There is going to be a full moon on Halloween night this year!” a tall, 
athletic-looking boy interrupted. 

“Yes, there is,” Mr. Shein agreed. “Many people believe a full moon is 
needed to bring the werewolf to life—but they are wrong. Although a 
werewolf’s powers do grow stronger as the moon grows fuller.” 

Crossing his legs, he leaned back and began to talk. He explained how the 
werewolf legends began over two hundred years ago in Europe. A normal 
person, bitten by a werewolf, becomes a werewolf himself when moonlight 
shines on him. 

“It is a curse that cannot be removed,” Mr. Shein said, speaking in a low, 
steady voice. Trying to sound spooky. “No matter how much he tries to live a 
normal life, a man inflicted with the curse turns into a wolf under the light of the 
moon.” 

“Girls too?” Hannah asked. 

Some kids giggled. 

“Yes. Girls too,” the teacher answered seriously. 

“The werewolf must rage and howl,” Mr. Shein continued. “And prowl the 
woods or forest in search of victims.” 

“Cool!” a red-haired boy in front of me muttered. 

Everyone laughed. 

“At daybreak, the werewolves must shed their wolf skin,” the teacher 
explained. “They return to human form. They must hide their wolf skin until the 
next night. They must hide the skin in a safe place. Because if someone takes the 
werewolf’s skin and burns it... the werewolf will die.” 

“Cool!” the red-haired boy repeated. 

More laughter. Kids started talking excitedly. 

It took a while for Mr. Shein to quiet everyone. He jumped to his feet, 
pulled down his yellow sweater, and paced in front of the chalkboard. 

“Does anyone in this class believe that werewolves really exist?” he asked. 

I snickered. I didn’t think any kids would raise their hands. 

But to my surprise, every single hand in the room shot up. 

“You all believe in werewolves!” Mr. Shein declared. 

“Yes, we do,” I heard Arjun murmur softly. 



“Yes, we do,” Sean repeated. 

I turned and realized they were both staring hard at me. 

I felt a sudden chill. What is their problem? I wondered. Why are they 
acting so weird? 



16 


After school, Sean and Arjun came up to me at the back of the classroom. 
Outside the room, lockers slammed. The tile walls echoed with shouts and 
laughter. 

The two guys studied me solemnly. “What’s up?” I greeted them, zipping 
my backpack. 

Mr. Shein waved and walked out, carrying a bulging briefcase. The three of 
us were alone in the room. 

“How’s it going?” Sean asked. 

“Is it weird being in a new school?” Arjun said. 

“Yeah. Kind of,” I told them. “Especially since I know I’m only here for a 
few weeks.” 

“You’re lucky!” Arjun joked. “Sean and I are stuck here.” 

“Wolf Creek isn’t so bad,” I said. I swung the backpack onto my shoulder. 

The two boys stared at me intently. They didn’t say anything. Sean shoved 
his hands into his baggy jeans pockets. Arjun fiddled with a silver ring on his 
little finger. 

Finally, Sean broke the silence. “You don’t believe in werewolves,” he said 
softly. 

“Huh? Well...” I hesitated. 

“You didn’t raise your hand,” Arjun added. “Everyone else did.” 

“Yeah. I know,” I replied. “I really don’t believe in them. I mean, come on, 
guys. It’s practically the twenty-first century. See a lot of guys with fur on their 
faces walking around the streets? I don’t think so!” 

I meant it to be funny. But they didn’t laugh. They kept staring at me with 
their solemn faces. 

“Werewolves exist,” Arjun said softly. “We can prove it to you.” 

“For sure,” I replied sarcastically, rolling my eyes. “The Easter Bunny 
exists too. I saw him riding a bus back home in Cleveland.” 

“We can prove it to you, Alex,” Arjun insisted. “We can show you a 
werewolf.” 

“A real one,” Sean added. 

“No, thanks,” I said. “I really—” 



“You can take pictures of it,” Arjun interrupted. 

“Yeah. You can take a whole roll!” his friend cried. 

That made me stop and think. I remembered the photo contest I planned to 
enter. I needed a Halloween photo—a really good Halloween photo—for the 
contest. 

They moved closer, surrounding me, forcing me to back up until I bumped 
into the windowsill. 

“Want to see a real werewolf, Alex?” Sean demanded. 

“Want to take photos of a real werewolf?” Arjun asked. 

They stared hard at me, challenging me. 

“What do I have to do?” I asked. 



17 


Aunt Marta laughed. “Hannah—you look dreadful !” she cried, pressing her 
hands against her cheeks. 

“Thank you!” Hannah took a low bow. “Thank you!” 

After dinner, Hannah had come over to show off her Halloween costume. 
She changed her mind about dressing as a pirate. The costume she chose instead 
was hard to describe. She had taken a lot of old clothes, torn them all up, and 
sewn them back together. 

Her baggy pants had one brown leg and one green leg. And they had 
checkered patches at the knees. She wore a ragged shirt of yellow, blue, red— 
every color you can imagine. An even more colorful jacket over the shirt. And a 
floppy rag hat that kept falling over her face. 

“What are you supposed to be?” I asked. “A junkyard?” 

She didn’t laugh. “I’m a rag doll,” she replied. “Don’t you get it?” She 
tugged at the jacket. “Rags?” 

Aunt Marta and Uncle Colin both laughed. I was happy to see them 
enjoying themselves. They had both seemed tired and low at dinner. They had 
barely spoken to me. 

“There used to be a song about a rag doll,” Aunt Marta said. “Remember it, 
Colin?” 

My uncle shook his head. “I don’t remember anything anymore,” he 
replied. “I’m lucky if I remember to get up in the morning!” 

“Oh, give me a break, Colin!” Aunt Marta scolded. She gave him a playful 
shove. She began singing a song about a rag doll. 

Hannah did a silly dance, twirling her hands above her head. One of her 
jacket sleeves fell off, and we all laughed. 

“Where’s your costume, Alex?” my aunt demanded. “Go put it on. Come 
on. Let’s have a preview.” 

“I—I haven’t put one together yet,” I stammered. 

“Well, let’s get some old clothes and make you a costume tonight!” Aunt 
Marta insisted. 

“No. I... need to think about it,” I told her. 

I didn’t have my mind on costumes. I kept glancing out the front window at 



the darkening sky. Thinking about what I planned to do later. 

I planned to meet Sean and Arjun in the woods by the creek. At school, 
they told me to take my camera and meet them there. 

They said that the werewolf comes to that spot every night when the moon 
is at the highest point in the sky. “It howls up at the moon,” Arjun said in an 
excited whisper. “And then it lowers its head and laps up water from the creek.” 

“Wait till you see it!” Sean exclaimed. “It’s a man and a wolf at the same 
time. He’s half-human, half-animal.” 

I narrowed my eyes at the two of them. I tried to decide if they were 
goofing or not. Their expressions were so serious—and so excited—I decided 
they were telling the truth. 

Was it possible? Did werewolves really exist? 

I pictured the howling creature in the Marlings’ window. And I pictured the 
two animals in the woods, ripped to pieces. 

By a werewolf? 

The back of my neck tingled. I’d never believed in werewolves. But I’d 
seldom been out of the city. 

Here in this small town surrounded by woods, they began to seem real. 

“Will you meet us at midnight?” Sean asked. 

I didn’t want to return to the woods at night. Not after what I’d seen there. 

But I didn’t want them to know I was afraid. 

And I really needed a great photo to win the contest. A photo of a werewolf 
would definitely win! What else could come close? 

So I agreed to sneak out of the house and meet Sean and Arjun at midnight 
in the woods. But now, as it grew later, I began to feel really nervous about it. 

As I glanced out at the darkness beyond the window, I had a heavy feeling 
in the pit of my stomach. And my hands were suddenly cold and clammy. 

“Alex, what are you thinking about?” Aunt Marta’s voice broke into my 
thoughts. 

“Huh?” I blinked and shook my head. 

Everyone laughed. “You were staring out the window with the strangest 
look on your face,” Hannah declared. 

“Oh. Just watching the moon,” I said with a shrug. 

“It’s Moon Madness!” Uncle Colin joked. “OOOH. Looks like a bad case!” 

“What’s that?” I asked. 

“How should I know?” my uncle replied. “I just made it up!” 



We all laughed again. 

Everyone was in such a good mood. I wished I could relax and have fun 
too. But all I could think about was sneaking out to the woods. 

Hannah went home a short while later. I said goodnight to my aunt and 
uncle and closed myself up in my room. 

I glanced at the bed-table clock. It read ten fifteen. 

Nearly two hours to wait. 

I checked out my camera. Made sure I had it loaded with high-speed film. 

Then I sat down to read a photography magazine—and wait—hoping the 
time would pass quickly. 

My eyes stared at the pages of the magazine. But I couldn’t read. I couldn’t 
concentrate. 

Every few seconds, my eyes went up to the bed-table clock. 

Why does time move so slowly when you’re waiting? 

Finally, at about ten to midnight, I closed my magazine. Pulled on an extra 
sweater and then my jacket. I grabbed my camera case and slung the strap over 
my shoulder. 

Then I tiptoed to the bedroom door. 

My aunt and uncle were probably out in the woods, photographing night 
animals. But in case they decided to stay in tonight, I didn’t want them to hear 
me sneak out. 

I clicked off the lights in my room. Then I reached for the doorknob and 
tugged. 

“Hey—!” 

I turned the knob and tugged again. I turned it the other way and gave the 
door a hard jerk. “I don’t believe it!” I gasped. I’d been locked in. 



18 


The door must be stuck, I decided. 

I tugged it hard. Tugged it a dozen times. I even tried pushing. But I 
couldn’t budge it. It had definitely been locked, locked from the outside. 

I angrily spun away from the door. 

Why did my aunt and uncle lock me in? I wondered. Because of last night? 
Because of my close calls in the woods? 

“They can’t do this to me!” I exclaimed. 

I ran to the window. I jerked the curtains apart and reached for the window 
handles. 

The window slid up a few inches—and I let out a gasp. 

Metal bars had been installed outside. 

When did they put those on? This afternoon? 

I’m a prisoner! I told myself. I’m locked in this room like an animal in a 

cage! 

“They can’t do this to me!” I repeated. “They can’t!” 

I slid the window up all the way. I grabbed the metal bars with both hands 
and struggled to pry them loose. 

But they wouldn’t budge. 

I was still tugging on the bars when I heard a low growl. 

My hands dropped away, and a sharp cry escaped my throat. 

I froze. 

And heard another growl. Louder this time. 

And close. So close. 

A shrill howl rose up. From the Marlings’ house? 

I moved my face up close to the bars and peered out. Their bedroom 
window stood open again. But the house was completely dark. No lights 
anywhere. 

I squinted into the darkness. The moon had disappeared behind a cloud. I 
could barely see across to their house. 

Pressed against the bars, I heard an animal grunt. And then a thud. 

A dark shape dropped down from the Marlings’ open window. Another 



thud. Another shape dropped down on all fours. 

One of the creatures raised its head in a long, mournful howl. 

And then they took off, loping heavily toward the backyard, heading to the 
woods. 

Dogs? Wolves? Humans? 

I couldn’t see clearly in the darkness. 

I stared out, and a silvery light washed over the house as the cloud drifted 
away from the moon. 

But now it was too late. Too late. 

The creatures had vanished. 

I pounded the bars with my fists. 

Sean and Arjun were waiting for me by the creek. And there was no way I 
could get there. 

What would they think? That I was a total chicken? A wimp? 

I’m missing my big chance to take a winning photograph! I realized. 

Angrily, I slammed the window shut. 

“Tomorrow night!” I declared out loud. “Tomorrow night I’m getting out of 
here. My aunt and uncle won’t stop me. 

“Tomorrow night I’m going into the woods, and I’m going to find out the 
truth about werewolves!” 



19 


“How could you do that to me?” I shrieked. I burst into the kitchen for breakfast 
the next morning, and strode angrily up to my aunt and uncle. 

“How could you lock me in my room without telling me?” I cried. 

Aunt Marta set down her coffee mug. She gazed up at me with a troubled 
expression. Then she turned to Uncle Colin. “Maybe we should have told Alex,” 
she said. 

Uncle Colin narrowed his eyes at me. “Did you try to get out last night, 
Alex?” 

“Well...” I hesitated. I didn’t want to tell them what I had planned to do. “I 
don’t like being in a cage!” I protested. “I’m twelve years old, and I really think 

“We’re sorry,” Aunt Marta interrupted. She glanced at the kitchen clock and 
poured me out a bowl of cornflakes. 

“But we did it for your own good,” Uncle Colin added. He folded his 
napkin tensely between his hands. “We had no choice. We can’t let you go 
running out to the woods the way you did your first night. It just isn’t safe.” 

“We’re responsible for you,” Aunt Marta said, pushing the cereal bowl 
across the table to me. “We promised your parents we’d return you safe and 
sound. We don’t want to lock you in, Alex. But we have to make sure—” 

“But—but—” I sputtered. 

“Besides, the Marlings called the police yesterday,” Uncle Colin said, 
frowning. 

“They what?” I cried. “They called the police—about me?” 

He nodded. “They complained about you spying on them,” he said. 

I let out an angry scream. “That’s totally stupid!” I cried. “I didn’t spy on 
them! I didn’t do anything to them!” 

“Okay, okay.” Aunt Marta came around the table and placed a comforting 
hand on my shoulder. “Don’t worry about the Marlings. Just don’t go anywhere 
near their house—okay?” 

I turned to her. “Are they werewolves?” I blurted out. 

Uncle Colin gasped. 

Aunt Marta uttered a short laugh. “Is that what Hannah told you?” she 



demanded. 

“Well... yes,” I replied. 

She shook her head. “Hannah has a twisted sense of humor,” she said. 

“The Marlings are just very odd, very unfriendly people,” Unde Colin told 
me. He glanced out the kitchen window toward their house. And added: “Two 
unfriendly people with two very unfriendly dogs.” 

“Hannah said they don’t have any dogs,” I insisted. 

Uncle Colin made a disgusted face. “Tell your friend Hannah to stop pulling 
your leg.” 

“What do you mean?” I asked. 

“She’s trying to scare you, Alex. Don’t listen to her.” 

The doorbell rang. Hannah had arrived to walk me to school. 

I was happy to get out of the house. I still felt angry about being locked up. 

As we walked to school, I didn’t tell Hannah about it. I knew she’d 
probably think it was funny. And she’d tell other kids about how my aunt and 
uncle were so worried about me, they locked me in like a baby. 

I didn’t mention the Marlings’ dogs, either. I didn’t want to get into another 
argument about werewolves. I wanted to find out the truth for myself. 

At school, I hung my jacket in my locker and started to Mr. Shein’s class. 
But as I turned the corner, Sean and Arjun stepped up to block my path. 

They’d been waiting for me. They moved quickly to back me against the 
wall. Their eyes glowed with excitement. 

“Hey, Alex.” Sean poked me in the shoulder. 

“Seen any werewolves lately?” Arjun demanded. 



20 


“Uh... well..I didn’t know what to say. “You see... my aunt and uncle...” 

Why were they staring at me like that? Were they trying to scare me? 

A strange grin spread over Sean’s face. “Have a good time in the woods last 
night?” he asked. 

“Yeah. How was it?” Arjun demanded. “Catch any werewolves, Alex?” 

I bumped them off me and stepped away from the wall. “You mean you 
weren’t there?” I cried. 

They both burst out laughing. They slapped each other a high five. 

“Of course not!” Arjun declared. “Why would we go into the woods in the 
middle of the night?” 

“I was sound asleep by midnight,” Sean said, grinning. 

They laughed and congratulated each other again. 

A joke. The whole thing had been a joke. They didn’t wait for me in the 
woods at midnight. They never intended to go to the woods. 

“So how was it?” Sean asked. “Were you surprised when Arjun and I didn’t 
show up?” 

“No. I didn’t even think of you,” I told them. “Do you know why? Because 
I was too busy taking photos of the werewolf!” 

“Huh?” Sean cried. 

It was their turn to be surprised. 

Of course I was lying. But they had no way of knowing that I hadn’t gone 
to the woods, either. 

“What did you see?” Arjun asked suspiciously. 

“I followed a werewolf,” I told him, forcing myself not to crack a smile. 
“He came to the creek and he drank, just as you said.” 

“Give me a break,” Sean groaned. 

“Yeah. Really!” Arjun rolled his eyes. “In your dreams.” 

“I can prove it. I took a whole roll of film,” I told them. 

“Let’s see the pictures,” Sean demanded. 

“I haven’t developed them yet,” I replied. 

They stared at me, trying to decide if I was telling the truth. I felt a laugh 



about to explode inside me. But somehow I kept a straight face. 

The bell rang. 

“We’re late!” Arjun cried. 

The three of us bolted down the hall to the room. We dove into our seats 
two seconds before Mr. Shein walked in. 

Don’t ask me what we talked about all morning. I didn’t hear a word. 

I was thinking hard, thinking about Sean and Arjun. What was I going to 
tell them tomorrow when they asked to see the werewolf photos? 

Would I have to confess that I lied to them? 

No, I decided. I had a better plan. 

“I’m going to sneak out tonight and take pictures of the Marlings’ house,” I 
whispered into the phone. 

“Huh? Alex? Why are you whispering?” Hannah’s voice rang shrilly in my 
ear. 

I was whispering because my aunt and uncle had only one telephone. An 
old-fashioned black phone set on a table in the living room. And the two of them 
were in the next room preparing dinner. I could see them from the armchair I 
slumped in. 

“Hannah, I’m going to hide at the side of the house,” I whispered. “And I’m 
going to snap some pictures of whoever—or whatever—jumps out of that 
bedroom window tonight.” 

“Do you have a sore throat or something?” Hannah demanded. “I can’t hear 
you, Alex.” 

I opened my mouth to repeat what I’d said—but Aunt Marta entered the 
room. “Dinner is ready, Alex. Who are you talking to?” she asked. 

“Hannah,” I told my aunt. “I’ve got to go,” I said into the phone. “Talk to 
you later.” I hung up the receiver. 

I hoped that maybe Hannah might want to sneak out at midnight and keep 
me company. I’ll have to ask her later, I decided. 

Yawning, pretending to be very sleepy, I went to my room a little after ten 
o’clock. A few minutes later, I heard the lock click outside my door. My aunt or 
uncle had locked me in again. 

But this time, I fooled them. This time, I was prepared. 

Before dinner, I’d jammed a wad of bubblegum into the latch. The door 



wasn’t really closed. 

Once again, I pulled on an extra sweater. And checked out my camera. And 
waited, gazing at the bed-table clock. 

Just before midnight, I swung the camera case over my shoulder. Slid the 
bedroom door open easily. And crept out of the house, under the white light of 
the moon, ready to solve the mystery of the Marlings. 



21 


I cast a quick glance at the Mailings’ house. Then I turned away and trotted 
across the wet grass to Hannah’s house. 

No lights were on. The storm door in back hadn’t been shut. The wind 
made it swing open, as if inviting me in. 

But I made my way up to Hannah’s bedroom window on the other side of 
the house. Silver moonlight washed over the glass, making it reflect the trees 
like a mirror. 

I couldn’t see inside. But the window was open a few inches. 

“Hannah—?” I called in a loud whisper. “Hannah—are you awake?” 

I heard someone stirring inside. The curtains shifted. “Who’s there?” 
Hannah called out sleepily. 

“It’s me!” I whispered, standing on tiptoe. “It’s Alex. Come to the window.” 

“Alex? What are you doing out there?” she demanded. 

“I’m going to take photos of the Marlings,” I told her. “Come out with me, 
Hannah.” 

“Huh? Photos?” she called out. “But it’s so late, Alex. I was asleep, and—” 

“Every night I hear howls from their house,” I told her. “And then someone 
—or something—jumps out of their bedroom window and runs into the woods. 
My uncle says it’s their dogs, but—” 

“I told you,” she interrupted. “The Marlings don’t have dogs. They’re 
werewolves. I know you don’t believe me. But it’s true. Your aunt and uncle 
know it’s true. But they don’t want you to be scared.” 

“That’s why I want to take photos,” I explained. “I mean, I could be the first 
person in the world to get a werewolf on film! Get dressed, Hannah. Come on!” 
I pleaded. “I want you to see too.” 

“You’re crazy, Alex! Get back in the house!” Hannah warned. She appeared 
at the window. She pulled it up higher and leaned out. 

“I’m not coming out there,” she insisted. “It’s too dangerous. You told me 
about those two animals you saw. They were ripped to shreds—right? If the 
Marlings see you, they’ll do the same thing to you!” 

Her words sent a cold shiver down the back of my neck. But I was 
desperate to solve the mystery—and to snap a great photo. 



“They won’t see us!” I told her. “We’ll hide behind the bushes at the side of 
the house.” 

“Don’t say us,” Hannah called out. “I’m not doing it, Alex. I’m too scared. 
I’m warning you, go back inside.” 

“Please!” I pleaded. I grabbed her arm. “Come on out, Hannah. You want to 
see the werewolves too—don’t you?” 

“No way!” She jerked her arm away. “Go home, Alex,” she repeated. “It’s 
not a game. It’s really dangerous.” 

“Listen, Hannah—” I started. 

But she slid the window shut. 

I stared at the reflection of the trees in the glass. Maybe she’s right, I 
thought. Another cold shiver ran down my back. Maybe this is a big mistake. 
Maybe it is too dangerous. If the Marlings catch me... 

I gasped when I heard a low growl. 

I froze. 

I didn’t have to turn around. I knew from the sound. 

A werewolf—it had sneaked up behind me. 



22 


Another low grunt made me cry out. 

My knees started to collapse. I took a deep, shivering breath and spun 
around to face the creature. 

No. 

Not there. 

No one there. 

I swallowed. Swallowed again. My mouth suddenly felt bone-dry. 

Another growl. I realized where it came from. From the back of the 
Marlings’ house. 

They’re about to jump out the window, I told myself. Those are the sounds I 
hear every night just before they climb out the bedroom window. 

And I’m standing out here in the open. I’ll be the first thing they see! 

My legs didn’t want to work. But I gritted my teeth, took a deep breath— 
and forced myself to move. 

My sneakers slid on the wet grass. I slipped, but I didn’t fall. 

I scrambled to the bushes that divided my aunt and uncle’s house from the 
Marlings’ house. 

I dropped to my knees, panting noisily. My heart pounded so hard, my chest 

hurt. 

I ducked my head. And grabbed for the straps on my camera case. 

A high, shrill animal howl floated out from the Marlings’ open bedroom 
window. The light of the moon made the side of their house gleam. 

The yard was nearly as bright as day. Everything glistened from the frosty 

dew. 

Ducking low behind the bushes, I could see every leaf, every dew-covered 
blade of grass. 

I tugged at the zipper of my camera case. I knew I had to pull the camera 
out—fast. But my hands were shaking so bad, I couldn’t budge the zipper. 
Another howl made me turn back to the window. 

A shadow moved. 

A leg slid out. 



Another leg. 

A slender form dropped to the ground. 

It all happened so quickly. As if time had been put on fast-forward. 

My eyes on the window, I struggled to unzip the camera case. 

Another body crawled out from the darkness of the Marlings’ bedroom 
window. 

Two forms stood on the ground and stretched. 

Two humans ! 

Not wolves. 

Humans. 

What were they wearing? 

Capes? 

Dark fur capes, draped over their shoulders, hanging heavily behind them. 

They had their backs to me. I couldn’t see their faces. 

Hands on their waists, they stretched, bending back, bending from side to 
side, as if limbering up their muscles for a long jog. 

And then they raised their heads to the moon—and howled. 

Turn around! I pleaded silently, trembling behind the bushes. Please turn 
around! I want to see your faces! 

“Ohhhh...” I uttered a startled moan as their fur capes began to move. The 
heavy capes began to curl around them, to tighten around their bodies. 

And I realized they weren’t capes. They were some kind of animal skins. 

Furry skins. With arms. And legs... 

The dark skins wrapped themselves tightly over the two humans. The fur 
spread over their bodies, slid over their heads, covered their legs, their arms, 
their hands. 

“Ohhhhh...” I shook so hard, I let go of the camera case and hugged 
myself. Hugged myself tight, trying to hold myself in, trying to keep myself 
together. 

The two figures howled again, raising their furry arms over their heads. 
Silvery claws slid out from their paws. 

The two creatures raked the claws at each other playfully, pretending to 
attack. Growling and grunting, they lowered themselves to all fours. 

No longer humans. 

Animals... wolf creatures... 

Hannah is right, I realized. She told the truth. The Marlings are 



werewolves. They turned into wolves under the moonlight. 

Gasping for breath, I snatched up the camera case. I fumbled once again 
with the zipper. Finally managed to pull it open. 

And they turned. They both turned toward me. 

Two wolves ! 

Their dark eyes stared out from beneath fur-covered foreheads. Their furry 
snouts snapped open to reveal rows of curled animal teeth. 

Werewolves. The Marlings were werewolves. Human and wolf at the same 

time! 

The werewolves nuzzled each other, growling softly. I raised the camera. I 
pulled myself up to my knees. 

I’ve got to snap a picture. Do it now, Alex! I ordered myself. 

But my hands shook so badly, I wasn’t sure I could hold the camera steady 
enough. 

Do it! Do it! 

I raised the viewfinder to my eye. I stood up a little higher to see over the 
top of the bush. 

“Ohhh.” As I raised myself, a sharp twig scraped the side of my face. 

And I dropped the camera! 

It landed on the grass with a THUD. 

The two wolf creatures turned. 

And saw me! 



23 


I sank to the ground. Pressed myself flat on my stomach. 

My chest heaved. I breathed through my mouth, struggling to keep 
perfectly still, perfectly silent. 

Did they see me? Did they? 

I raised my head enough to peer out at them beneath the bottom branch of 
the bush. 

They had their fur-covered snouts raised. They sniffed the air. 

Did they smell me? Did they know I was hiding down here? 

Were they about to leap into the bush and rip me apart with those long, 
silvery claws? 

I held my breath, squinting across the grass at them. 

They sniffed some more, grunting softly. 

Then they turned away. Dropped to all fours. And loped off, heading to the 
woods. 

I waited until I could no longer hear the soft thud of their paws or their low 
growls and grunts. Then I slid forward on my stomach, reached out, and grabbed 
my camera. 

My camera! 

I hadn’t snapped any photos. Not a single shot. 

I climbed shakily to my feet and rubbed the wet dew from the lens. Then I 
raised my eyes to the woods. 

I have to follow them, I decided. 

I have to take some photos. This is the chance of a lifetime! 

If I can take the first-ever shots of actual werewolves, I’ll be famous! I 
pictured myself in newspapers and on magazine covers. I imagined my photos of 
the Marlings on display in fancy photo galleries. 

And I thought of how proud of me Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta would be. 

That thought sent a chill down my back. Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta— 
they were working in the woods right now. Busy photographing animals of the 
night. 

Did they know that two werewolves were on the loose? Did they know that 
two werewolves were prowling the woods, searching for victims? 



They’re not safe out there, I realized. 

Of course, following the werewolves into the woods was crazy—and 
dangerous. But now I had two reasons to chase after them. 

I had to snap some pictures —and warn my aunt and uncle. 

My eyes on the woods, I jammed the camera into the case and slung it over 
my shoulder. Then I began trotting across the backyard toward the trees, 
following the fresh paw prints in the frosty grass. 

I ducked into the trees and followed the curving path. Moonlight trickled 
through the treetop leaves, making eerie, shifting patterns on the ground. 

I didn’t have to go far to catch up with the two werewolves. Just past the 
bent, old-man tree, I heard an animal grunt. And then a shrill cry of attack. 

I stopped—and peered through a low evergreen shrub. Mouths gaping open, 
claws raised, the two wolf creatures leaped. 

They’ve caught someone! I realized, frozen in horror. 

Who is it? My aunt? My uncle? 



24 


The two werewolves wrestled with their prey. 

I heard a shrill bleat of pain. Then I saw four hooves shoot up in the air. 

Not a human, I realized, squinting into the dim light. They’ve trapped a 
deer. A baby deer. 

They’re going to kill it. 

They’re going to tear it to shreds. 

What can I do? I asked myself. How can I save it? 

I didn’t think. I was too terrified to think clearly. 

I tossed back my head. And I let out a loud wolf howl. 

My cry echoed off the trees. 

The snarling werewolves stopped their attack. They raised their heads. 

They turned toward my cry. 

Just long enough for the fawn to scramble to its feet. It shook itself—like a 
dog after a bath—and took off into the trees. 

The werewolves sniffed the air furiously. They didn’t seem to notice that 
the fawn had escaped. Their eyes glowed red in the pale moonlight. They turned, 
uttering low, angry growls. Lowered their heads. And came charging at me. 



25 


I staggered back. 

Too frightened to move. 

No time to run. 

The ground seemed to shake under the thunder of the wolves’ paws. 

I opened my mouth to scream—but no sound came out. 

The wolves’ jaws snapped. Their red eyes glowed as if on fire. 

I raised my arms in front of me, as if to shield myself. 

Prepared for the attack. 

And the wolves turned away. Turned sharply to the right, running together. 
A scrawny brown rabbit scrambled over the path. 

The wolves had turned away from me to chase the rabbit! 

Snarling furiously, they lowered their heads—and caught the rabbit easily. 
The little creature didn’t put up much of a fight. 

One wolf snapped its neck. The other bit hungrily into its belly. 

Breathing hard, I swung my camera case around. And pulled the camera out 
with a quick jerk. 

My hand trembled as I raised the viewfinder to my eye. But I steadied the 
camera with both hands. 

And clicked off a shot. 

And then another. 

I snapped a shot of the wolves tugging the rabbit apart. And another shot of 
the two of them eating side by side. 

When the wolves finished, nothing remained of the rabbit. Licking their 
teeth, they turned and loped off into the trees. 

Holding my camera in front of me with both hands, I followed after them. 

I guess I was in some kind of shock. I know I wasn’t thinking clearly. 

I was barely thinking at all! 

I had nearly been caught by the two werewolves. They would have finished 
me the way they’d finished that poor rabbit. 

But I knew I had to follow them. I had to stay in the woods. 

I had to warn my aunt and uncle. I had to find them and tell them they were 



wrong about the Marlings. That Hannah told the truth. 

I had to let them know the danger they were in. 

And I had to take more photographs. 

I’d been through such a horrible scare. My heart pounded, and my arms and 
legs felt all trembly and weak. I didn’t feel like me. I felt as if I were outside 
myself, watching myself. 

But I knew I couldn’t run back to the house. Not until my aunt and uncle 
were safe. 

I kept pretty far behind the creatures, far enough that I could slip behind a 
tree or bush if one of them glanced back. And I kept my camera raised, ready to 
snap off shots. 

They loped slowly to the creek. I watched them lower their heads and 
noisily lap up water. 

They didn’t look at all human now. Their bodies had become wolf bodies. I 
couldn’t see anything human in their faces. Their glowing eyes were animal 
eyes. 

They took a long drink from the creek, washing down their dinner, I guess. 
I steadied my camera and clicked off several shots. 

I wished Hannah had come with me. I wanted someone else to be there with 
me, to see what I was seeing. 

I couldn’t wait to get back and tell her that she was right about the 
Marlings. That they really were werewolves. 

The two wolf creatures suddenly raised their heads from the water, turned, 
and sniffed the air. 

Did they smell me? Or some other prey? 

I slid behind a fat tree trunk and held my breath. 

When I carefully peered out, they were loping along the creek shore. I 
waited until they had gone a short distance, then I crept out and followed them. 

I followed the two werewolves all night. I finished one roll of film, then 
popped in another. I shot them rising up on their furry hind legs and howling at 
the moon. And I clicked off several more horrifying shots of them devouring 
small animals. 

And I searched for my aunt and uncle. Desperate to warn them, to tell them 
what I had learned. 

As I trailed behind the creatures—so frightened and excited—I completely 
lost track of time. It was as if I were walking through a dream. None of it 



seemed real. 

Finally, a red crack of sunlight appeared along the ground. To my shock, it 
was nearly daybreak. 

The werewolves moved slowly now. Their loping trot had become a stiff¬ 
legged walk. 

As they stepped out of the trees into their backyard, they rose up onto their 
hind legs. They staggered awkwardly to the back of their house. 

I stayed by the trees, afraid to go too close. The sky was brightening as the 
sun made its way higher. If the wolf creatures turned around, they could see me 
easily. 

I raised my camera. I had only a few shots left. 

The two werewolves staggered on two legs to the side of their house. They 
stretched their furry forearms and raised their faces to the brightening sun. 

“Oh!” I couldn’t help it. I uttered a shocked cry as they began to shed their 
skins. 

The fur appeared to peel back. 

The claws slid out of view. And the fur pulled back, revealing their human 
hands. 

As I gaped in amazement, the black wolf fur peeled off their arms and legs, 
then slid off their bodies. 

They had their backs to me. 

The fur skins settled into capes again. The two humans reached up and 
pulled off the heavy capes. 

I’m going to see the Marlings for the first time! I realized. 

They lowered the wolf skin capes to the ground. 

They turned slowly. 

And I saw their faces. 



26 


As the morning sunlight washed over their faces, I nearly cried out—in horror 
and disbelief. 

Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta stretched, brushed back their silvery hair, then 
bent to pick up their wolf skins. 

My aunt and uncle —they were the werewolves! 

Uncle Colin raised his eyes to the woods. I fell back behind a tree. Did he 
see me? 

No. 

My whole body trembled. I wanted to cry out: “No! No! This can’t be 
happening!” 

But I pressed myself against the tree and kept my jaws clamped tight. I 
couldn’t let them see me. I couldn’t let them know that I knew the truth. 

The smooth tree trunk felt cool against my forehead. I had to think. I had to 
make a plan. 

What should I do? I knew I couldn’t stay with them any longer. I couldn’t 
live in a house with two werewolves. 

But where could I go? Who would help me? 

Who would believe me? 

I watched my aunt and uncle fold up their wolf skins. Then Uncle Colin 
helped Aunt Marta climb into the Marlings’ bedroom window. Once she was 
inside, he followed her in. 

“The Marlings!” I murmured to myself. Were they okay in there? Or did my 
aunt and uncle do something terrible to them? 

A few minutes later, Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta climbed back out of the 
window. Then they scurried across the driveway, into their own house. 

I clung to the tree trunk for a while, watching the two houses. Thinking 

hard. 

Were the Marlings asleep in their house? Did they know that the two 
werewolves were in there? Were the Marlings werewolves too? 

I wanted to run away. To make my way to the street and just keep running 
until I was miles and miles away. 

But I had to find out about the Marlings. I couldn’t leave without finding 



out the truth about them. 

So I watched the two houses for a while longer. No sign of anyone moving 
about. 

I pushed myself away from the tree and quickly made my way through the 
Marl mgs’ overgrown backyard. 

I ducked behind bushes and kept my eyes on my aunt and uncle’s house. 
The blinds on their bedroom windows were shut. 

Holding my breath, I darted to the Marlings’ bedroom window. I grabbed 
the windowsill and peered inside. Dark. I couldn’t see anything. 

“Here goes,” I murmured softly. “Good luck, Alex.” 

I lifted myself up onto the sill, then lowered my legs into the room. It took a 
few seconds for my eyes to adjust to the dim light. 

And then what I saw shocked me nearly as much as learning that my aunt 
and uncle were werewolves. 

I saw nothing. 

The bedroom was completely bare. Not a stick of furniture. No artwork or 
mirrors on the wall. No carpet over the dust-covered floorboards. 

Turning to the bedroom door, I spotted the two wolf skins. They were 
neatly folded and piled side by side in front of the closet. 

Taking a deep breath, I moved cautiously to the open doorway. I poked my 
head out into the hall. Also unlit and bare. 

“Anyone home?” I choked out in a tiny voice. “Hello? Anyone home?” 

Silence. 

I crept down the hall toward the front of the house. I peered into each room. 

They were all bare and empty, covered with a thick layer of dust. 

I stepped into the middle of the living room. No furniture. No lights. No 
sign that anyone had lived here in years! 

“Oh, wow!” I cried out as I realized the tmth. My voice echoed off the bare 
walls. 

No one lives here, I told myself. There are no Marlings! 

My aunt and uncle had made them up. They used this house to hide their 
wolf skins. They’d made up the Marlings to keep people out of the house. 

No Marlings. No Marlings. No Marlings. 

It was all a lie! 

I have to warn Hannah, I decided. No one is safe around here. 

I pictured my aunt and uncle devouring that helpless little rabbit last night. I 



pictured them wrestling with that baby deer. 

I have to tell Hannah and her family, I decided. And then we have to run 
away from here—as far as we can. 

I turned and made my way quickly through the empty house. Then I 
lowered myself out the bedroom window into the backyard. 

The morning sun was still a red ball, low over the treetops. The early dew 
glistened over the grass. 

“Hannah, I hope you’re awake,” I murmured. “If not, I’ll have to wake you 

up.” 

I turned away from the Marlings’ window and began to run across the back 
toward Hannah’s house. 

I went about six or seven steps. Then I stopped with a gasp as Aunt Marta’s 
voice rang out behind me. “Alex—what on earth are you doing out there?” 



27 


I spun around. My knees nearly collapsed. The ground tilted up, then down. 

Aunt Marta stood in the kitchen doorway. “Alex—why are you up so early? 
It’s Saturday morning.” She narrowed her eyes at me suspiciously. 

“I—well...” I was shaking so hard, I couldn’t speak! 

“Where are you going in such a hurry?” my aunt demanded. I saw Uncle 
Colin standing behind her in the kitchen. 

“To... Hannah’s,” I managed to reply. “To talk about... uh... our costumes 
for trick-or-treating tonight.” 

I watched her face. Did she believe me? 

I didn’t think so. 

“It’s too early to be running over to Hannah’s,” she scolded. She motioned 
for me to come inside. “Come in, Alex. Come get some breakfast first.” 

I hesitated. My mind whirred. 

Should I make a run for it? Run to the street and keep going? 

How far would I get before they caught me? My aunt and uncle were both 
werewolves. If they caught me—what would they do to me? Would I be their 
breakfast? 

No. I decided not to run. Not just yet, anyway. Not until I had a chance to 
talk to Hannah. 

I felt Aunt Marta’s eyes on me as I made my way slowly into the house. 
Uncle Colin muttered good morning. He stared hard at me too. “Early start, 
huh?” he asked softly. 

I nodded and took my place at the breakfast table. 

“Marta and I worked all night,” Uncle Colin reported. He yawned. “We 
took some pretty good shots.” 

That’s a lie! I wanted to shout. I followed you. I saw what you did. I know 
what you are! 

But I didn’t say anything. Just stared down at my cereal bowl. 

I’m having breakfast with two werewolves! I thought, feeling my stomach 
churn. My aunt and uncle run through the woods at night, murdering and ripping 
animals apart. 

I can’t sit here another minute! I told myself. I started to get up. 



But I felt Uncle Colin’s hand on my shoulder. “Relax, Alex. Have a nice 
breakfast,” he said softly. 

“But, I—” I didn’t know what to say. I was too terrified to eat. I wanted him 
to take his hand off me. It was making my whole body tremble. 

“It’s Halloween,” Uncle Colin said. “You’ll be out late tonight.” 

“Have a good breakfast,” Aunt Marta chimed in. 

They watched me as I choked down my cornflakes. They didn’t smile. They 
were studying me coldly. 

They know that I followed them, I decided. They know that I know their 
secret. 

They’re not going to let me get away. 

“Uh... I have to go to Hannah’s now,” I said, struggling to sound calm and 
cheerful. I slid my chair back and started to stand up. 

But I felt Uncle Colin’s hand grip my shoulder again. He grasped me tightly 
and held on. 

“Alex, come with me,” he ordered. 



28 


He kept his hand clamped tightly on my shoulder as he led me to the back of the 
garage. He walked quickly and didn’t say a word. 

I wondered if I could break out of his grip and make a run for it. How far 
would I get? 

He let go of my shoulder. What did he plan to do? 

“I’m sorry I followed you,” I said in a choked whisper. “I—I won’t tell 
anyone what I saw.” 

He hadn’t heard me. He had moved to the corner of the garage and picked 
up a long-handled tool. 

He shoved it toward me. “I need your help this morning,” he said. “There’s 
a lot of yard work to be done.” 

I swallowed. “Yard work?” 

Uncle Colin nodded. “That’s a weed whacker. Have you ever used one 
before?” 

“No. Not really,” I confessed. The handle shook in my hand. 

“It’s pretty easy,” he said. “I need you to cut down all these weeds behind 
the garage.” 

“Yeah. Okay,” I replied, feeling dazed. 

“And be careful not to toss any weeds in the Marlings’ yard,” he warned. 
“I’m sure they’ll be watching your every move. Waiting to complain to us about 
you.” 

“No problem,” I replied. 

There are no Marlings! I wanted to scream. 

“I’ll work with you,” Uncle Colin said, wiping sweat off his forehead with 
the back of his hand. “Together we can teach these weeds a lesson they’ll never 
forget.” He grinned for the first time that morning. 

Does he know that I know? I wondered. Is that why he’s keeping me here 
this morning? 

My uncle and I worked in the yard all day. Whenever I would take a short break, 
I’d catch him watching me coldly, studying me. 

I was so frightened. I wanted to drop my tools and run. 



But I couldn’t leave without warning Hannah and her family. They had to 
know that they were in danger too. 

I didn’t see Hannah until after dinner. She burst in just as we were finishing. 

“Well? How do I look?” she demanded. She did a fast twirl in her rag-doll 
costume. 

“You look wonderful!” Aunt Marta gushed. 

Hannah frowned at me. “Alex, where’s your costume? Come on. You’re not 
ready to trick-or-treat?” 

“Uh... it’s upstairs,” I told her. “It won’t take me long to get it together. 
Uh... come help me—okay?” 

I practically pulled her all the way to my room. 

“It’s a great night out,” she said. “Perfect for trick-or-treating. The night of 
the full moon.” 

I tugged her into the room and shut the door behind us. “We’ve got a 
problem,” I told her. 

She fiddled with the rag hat that flopped down over her forehead. 
“Problem?” 

“Yeah. Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta are werewolves.” 

“Huh?” Her eyes bulged. “What did you say?” 

I explained everything. Speaking rapidly in a low whisper, I told her all that 
I’d seen last night. “They hide their wolfskins in the Marlings’ house,” I 
finished. 

“But the Marlings—?” Hannah started. 

“There are no Marlings!” I cried. “The house is empty. My aunt and uncle 
use it as a hiding place for their wolf skins.” 

Hannah stared at me openmouthed for a long time. Her chin trembled. 
“But... what are we going to do?” she cried breathlessly. “Your aunt and uncle— 
they seem like such nice people. They’ve always been so nice to me.” 

“They’re werewolves!” I cried. “We have to tell your family. We have to 
hurry away from here. We have to get help. Tell the police or something.” 

“But—but—” Hannah sputtered, her face twisted in panic. 

And suddenly I had another idea. “Wait!” I cried. “Hannah, what did Mr. 
Shein say about werewolves shedding their skin? Didn’t he say that if someone 
finds their skins and burns them, the werewolves will be destroyed?” 

Hannah nodded. “Yes. That’s what he said. But—” 

“So that’s what we’ll do!” I cried excitedly. “We’ll go next door, and—” 



“But you don’t want to kill your aunt and uncle—do you?” Hannah replied. 
“Oh. No. Of course not,” I told her. “I’m so frightened, I’m not thinking 
clearly. I just thought—” 

“Whoa. Wait a minute, Alex!” Hannah cried, grabbing my arm. “I know 
what we can do. I have a plan that might work!” 



29 


I heard my aunt and uncle moving around in the living room. Outside the 
bedroom window, the white full moon was rising behind the trees. Wisps of 
black cloud floated over it like wriggling snakes. 

Hannah tugged me farther into the room. “What if we hide the wolf skins?” 
she asked in an excited whisper. 

“Hide them?” I whispered back. “What will that do?” 

“Your aunt and uncle won’t be able to find them,” Hannah replied. “The 
night will pass. They won’t be able to change into wolves.” 

“So maybe if they go a whole night without the skins, it will cure them!” I 
cried. 

Hannah nodded. “It’s worth a try, Alex. It might just work, and—” She 
stopped. “No. Wait. I have an even better idea. We’ll wear the skins!” 

“Excuse me?” I gasped. “Wear them? Why?” 

“Because your aunt and uncle will search everywhere for the skins,” 
Hannah replied. “They’ll search every house, every garage, every yard. But they 
won’t look for them on us! That’s the last place they’d look!” 

“I get it,” I replied. “And we’ll make sure to stay away so they don’t see us 
until after daybreak.” 

I wasn’t sure whether the plan made any sense or not. Hannah and I were 
both too frightened to think! 

Maybe... just maybe... we could cure Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta by 
keeping the skins from them until morning. 

“Let’s try it,” I said. 

“Okay,” Hannah agreed. “Quick—get into your pirate costume. We don’t 
want your aunt and uncle to suspect anything. While you’re doing that, I’ll sneak 
next door and slip on one of the wolf skins.” 

She pushed me toward the old clothes I had tossed onto the bed. “Hurry. It’s 
getting late. Meet me in back of the garage. I’ll bring out your wolf skin for 
you.” 

Hannah disappeared out the door. I heard her in the living room. She said 
good-bye to Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta and told them she was going to meet 
me outside. 



I heard the front door slam. Hannah was on her way next door to get the 
wolf skins. 

I quickly pulled on the ragged old shirt and torn trousers of my costume. I 
wrapped a bandanna around my head. 

A sound at the bedroom door made me spin around. 

“Aunt Marta!” I cried. 

She stood in the doorway, frowning at me. “It won’t work,” she said, 
shaking her head. 

“Huh?” I gasped. 

“Alex, it won’t work,” she repeated unhappily. 



30 


My aunt moved quickly into the room. 

I couldn’t move. No time to try an escape. 

“It won’t work. That costume won’t work,” Aunt Marta said, shaking her 
head. “You need some makeup. Some black stains on your face. Something to 
make you look less clean!” 

I burst out laughing. I thought Aunt Marta had overheard our plan. But she 
only wanted to improve my pirate costume! 

It took several minutes for my aunt to apply the makeup. Then she searched 
several drawers until she found a gold hoop earring, which she clipped on one 
ear. 

“There. Much better,” she said, grinning. “Now, hurry. Hannah is waiting 
for you.” 

I thanked her and hurried out. Hannah was waiting for me. Behind the 
garage. Already in a wolf skin. 

I gasped when I saw her. It was so strange seeing Hannah’s eyes peering out 
from above a fur-covered snout. 

“What took you so long?” she demanded. Her voice was muffled inside the 
furry wolf head. 

“Aunt Marta,” I replied. “She had to fix up my costume.” I narrowed my 
eyes at Hannah. “How does it feel in there?” 

“Very itchy,” she grumbled. “And hot. Here.” She handed me the other wolf 
skin. “Hurry. Put it on. The moon is already high. Your aunt and uncle will be 
looking for these soon.” 

I took the skin from her. My hand sank into the thick fur. I unfolded it and 
held it up. “Here goes,” I whispered. “I said I wanted to be a werewolf for 
Halloween. Guess I get my wish.” 

“Just hurry!” Hannah urged. “We don’t want them to catch us.” 

I pulled the wolf skin over my head. Down over the old clothes of my 
costume. It felt a little tight. Especially the furry legs. The face fit snugly over 
my face. 

“You’re right. It’s itchy,” I groaned. “It’s so tight. I’m not sure I can walk!” 

“It loosens up after a bit,” Hannah whispered. “Come on. Let’s get away 



from here.” 

She led the way across the backyard. Then we turned and trotted along the 
side of her house and down to the street. 

I heard voices in the next block. Kids shouting, “Trick-or-treat!” 

“We might be safer with other kids,” I suggested. “I mean, if we find a 
whole group and stick with it....” 

“Good idea,” Hannah replied. We crossed the street. 

It was already getting really hot inside my wolf skin. I could feel the sweat 
mnning down my forehead. 

We walked for several blocks. But most of the kids were younger than us. 
We didn’t find anyone good to hang out with. 

We turned a corner and walked several more blocks, into the next 
neighborhood. 

“Hey—look who’s there!” Hannah declared, bumping my arm. 

I followed her gaze and saw a mummy and a robot carrying trick-or-treat 
bags across someone’s front lawn. 

“It’s Sean and Arjun,” Hannah cried. 

“Let’s trick-or-treat with them!” I suggested. I began running across the 
grass, waving my paw at them. “Hey, guys! Hey!” 

They turned and stared at us. 

“Wait up!” I called through my fur-covered snout. 

They screamed. And dropped their bags. And took off, running full speed, 
shrieking for help. 

Hannah and I stopped at the edge of a driveway and watched them run. 
“Think maybe we scared them?” Hannah said, laughing. 

“Maybe a little,” I replied. 

We both laughed. 

But not for long. 

I heard heavy, running footsteps on the pavement behind us. 

I turned—and let out a gasp as my aunt and uncle came mnning furiously 
down the street. 

“There they are!” Uncle Colin cried, pointing at us. “Get them!” 



31 


I froze for a moment, horrified by the sight of my aunt and uncle running toward 
us so furiously, so desperately. 

“Don’t move!” Aunt Marta pleaded. “We need those skins!” 

My legs refused to budge. But then Hannah gave me a hard shove. And we 
both took off. 

We ran wildly, across lawns and empty lots. We cut behind someone’s 
house, then dove through an opening in their tall hedge. 

My aunt and uncle stayed close behind, running full speed, and calling out 
as they ran, “Give us our skins! Give us our skins!” 

Their breathless voices rang in my ears. Their words became an eerie chant. 

“Give us our skins! Give us our skins!” 

We must have run for blocks. It all became a dark blur to me. My heavy 
wolf paws thumped the ground. I struggled to keep my balance. Sweat poured 
down my face inside the heavy fur. 

Another turn. More dark backyards. And then the tilting, tangled trees of 
the woods rose up in front of us. 

Hannah and I dove into the woods, darting between the trees and tall weeds. 
And still my aunt and uncle came after us, chanting, chanting their desperate 
plea: 

“Give us our skins! Give us our skins!” 

We scrambled up a low hill lined with evergreens. Pinecones slid under my 
heavy paws and rolled down the hill. Hannah stumbled and dropped to her 
knees. She scrambled on all fours to the top. 

“Give us our skins! Give us our skins!” 

The cry grew shrill and breathless. 

And then—suddenly—everything seemed to stop. 

As if the whole world had stopped spinning. 

As if even the wind had stopped blowing on top of that little hill. 

I could feel the silence. 

Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta had stopped their chant. 

Panting, Hannah and I turned to face them. 



“The moon—” Hannah whispered breathlessly to me. She pointed. “The 
full moon, Alex. It’s so high. It must be at its peak.” 

And as she whispered those words, my aunt and uncle dropped to their 
knees. They tossed back their heads. As the white light of the moon washed over 
their faces, I saw their pain, their horror. 

They opened their mouths in long, mournful howls. 

Their howls became hideous screams. They tore at their hair with both 
hands. Shut their eyes. And screamed, screamed in agony. 

“Hannah—what have we done?” I cried.

Tugging at their hair, my aunt and uncle screamed. 

And then, they lowered their hands. And closed their mouths. And a calm 
seemed to sweep over them. 

As Hannah and I stared down at them, Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta helped 
each other to their feet. They brushed each other off. Smoothed down their hair. 

When they finally gazed up at us, I saw tears in their eyes. 

“Thank you,” they both cried. 

“Thank you for saving us!” Uncle Colin exclaimed. 

And then they rushed up the hill to hug us, hug us so joyfully. 

“You freed us from the curse!” Aunt Marta declared, tears running down 
her face. “The moon reached the highest point in the sky, and we didn’t 
transform. Colin and I are no longer werewolves!” 

“How can we ever thank you?” Uncle Colin cried. “You are both so 
wonderful. So brave.” 

“So hot!” I grumbled. “I can’t wait to get out of this itchy skin!” 

Everyone laughed. 

“Let’s go back to our house!” Aunt Marta cried. “We’ll have a real 
celebration!” 

The four of us hurried back to the house. We laughed and joked all the way. 

Uncle Colin and Aunt Marta made their way in through the kitchen door. 
“Homemade doughnuts!” Aunt Marta promised. “And big mugs of hot 
chocolate! How does that sound?” 

“Sounds great!” Hannah and I agreed. 

Hannah started to follow them into the house. But I held her back. 

“Let’s dump the skins next door,” I said. “No one will ever need them 
again. Let’s dump them in the abandoned house.” 

She hesitated. She seemed afraid to go back into that dark, empty house. 

But I went running over to the Marlings’ house. I couldn’t wait to take off 
the hot, smelly wolfskin. 

I pulled myself onto the window ledge, then lowered my legs into the open 
bedroom window. I stepped into the room. Pale moonlight washed over the bare 
floorboards. 



Hannah dropped into the room behind me. “Alex—?” she called. 

I started to tug off the heavy wolf skin. 

But something near the closet caught my eye. 

I stopped and walked over to it. 

A folded-up wolf skin lay on the floor against the wall. 

“Huh?” 

I let out a startled cry. And turned to Hannah. “How can there be a wolf 
skin in here?” I asked. “There were only two of them—right? You put one on, 
and you gave one to me.” 

Hannah stepped up beside me. Her eyes locked on mine. “I didn’t wear the 
one from this house, Alex,” she said softly. “I used my own. I just got it last 
night.” 

“Huh?” I cried. “I don’t get it.” 

“You will,” she whispered. 

She knocked me to the floor with her heavy forepaws, and sank her teeth 
into my chest.
