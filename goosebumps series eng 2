1
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,960
Goosebumps, if you will
beware, you're in for a scare.

2
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Oh wait!

3
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,970
Good Judah, come on.

4
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,860
Have a nice trip, Bird.

5
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,780
Samantha Bird, keep your head up.

6
00:01:25, --> 00:01:26,
Get back in there.

7
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,220
It's no good, Coach.

8
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,
You're a natural, Samantha.

9
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,
That's enough of that.


00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,020
Come on, Bird.

11
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,
You're my tallest player.

12
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,900
I need you on my team.

13
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,600
One more time, Anna.

14
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,
Go for it, Sam!

15
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,420
Okay, Cory.

16
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,
Why don't you fly away, Bird?

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,440
Take off, give the team a chance.

18
00:01:56, --> 00:01:58,
Alright, Judah, that's enough.

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,320
Okay, girls, back to work.

20
00:02:01, --> 00:02:02,
Free throw!

21
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,
Sam, it's okay.

22
00:02:46, --> 00:02:47,
Just relax.

23
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,600
I know you're scared, just try to breathe.

24
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,600
You just have the wind knocked out of you.

25
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,920
For a moment there, I thought
the bird was really going to do it.

26
00:02:57, --> 00:02:58,000
Do what?

27
00:02:58, --> 00:02:59,
Fly away.

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,960
Bird girl cleared for take off.

29
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,740
Samantha?

30
00:03:,980 --> 00:03:12,940
You want to help me strangle Judith?

31
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,380
Bad idea.

32
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,280
Why?

33
00:03:15, --> 00:03:16,
Give me one good reason.

34
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,840
Your basketball team will
never win another game.

35
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,
Then why did you pick on me?

36
00:03:21, --> 00:03:22,440
I did nothing to her.

37
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
Don't let her get to you.

38
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Judith is Judith.

39
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,
I wish... Oh, no way.

40
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,920
The bird actually tried to fly today.

41
00:03:32, --> 00:03:34,
She's as clumsy at flying
as she is at basketball.

42
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,900
I flipped because...

43
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,640
Nice lip control.

44
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,740
That is so disgusting.

45
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
Hey, Bobby.

46
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

47
00:04:, --> 00:04:11,590
Excuse me.

48
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,8
I'm really sorry, I...

49
00:04:14, --> 00:04:15,
I didn't see you.

50
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,
No, I'm sorry to have frightened you.

51
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,350
Oh.

52
00:04:22, --> 00:04:23,670
There it is.

53
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,950
I have been looking all over for this.

54
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,430
It's yours.

55
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,270
I found it in the gym.

56
00:04:30,4 --> 00:04:36,3
Isn't it amazing how lost objects...
They find their way to strange places.

57
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,430
Really strange, but if it's yours, here.

58
00:04:41,9 --> 00:04:42,9
Thank you.

59
00:04:47, --> 00:04:50,
Now, maybe you can help
me with something else.

60
00:04:50, --> 00:04:52,251
Can you tell me how to get to Moss Avenue?

61
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,300
Moss Avenue.

62
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,
That's way across town.

63
00:04:55, --> 00:04:57,720
Oh, how could that have happened?

64
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,280
How could I be so far out of my way?

65
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,400
That happens to me all the time.

66
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,960
That's kind of you to say
so, but I don't believe it.

67
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,260
Oh, no, really, it's true.

68
00:05:06,7 --> 00:05:08,
Would you mind taking me there?

69
00:05:09, --> 00:05:11,440
Gee, I have to get home.

70
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,060
Please.

71
00:05:13,8 --> 00:05:14,8
I'd be so grateful.

72
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,900
If it's not too far out of your way.

73
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,820
Sure, I guess it's not that far.

74
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,
You are so kind.

75
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,430
Thank you, uh...

76
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,980
Samantha Byrd.

77
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,
Thank you, Samantha Byrd.

78
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,360
You may call me Clarissa.

79
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,840
I don't know how I could have got so lost.

80
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,020
Are you sure this is where you want to be?

81
00:05:49, --> 00:05:50,
This is fine.

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,960
Okay, then, bye.

83
00:05:52, --> 00:05:53,
Wait.

84
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:57,380
I'd like to give you something
for being so kind to a stranger.

85
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,820
You don't have to give me anything, really.

86
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,
Most young people wouldn't be so kind.

87
00:06:04,0 --> 00:06:06,060
You must let me repay you, please.

88
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,740
I insist.

89
00:06:09,0 --> 00:06:11,
I shall grant you...

90
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:12,665
three wishes.

91
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,400
Sure, I mean, that's really cool.

92
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,
But I don't have any wishes right now.

93
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,600
I've got to go.

94
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Of course.

95
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,020
I've kept you far too long already.

96
00:06:25, --> 00:06:27,381
But understand that
this is no joke, Samantha.

97
00:06:29, --> 00:06:30,420
Make your first wish.

98
00:06:33, --> 00:06:34,620
Uh... Okay.

99
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:35,621
Okay.

0
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,880
I wish I was the best player
on the basketball team.

1
00:06:40, --> 00:06:42,620
Uh, that's not important, really.

2
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,320
Just forget it.

3
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,260
I've got to go.

4
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Wait.

5
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,020
I want you to have this.

6
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,
And by the way, your wish will come true.

7
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,380
You will be the best player on the team.

8
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,420
One, two, three.

9
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:07,421
Mercy!

1
00:07:16, --> 00:07:17,290
Let's try it again.


00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,440
What is going on out there?


00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,
I don't know. I don't feel so good.


00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,
Anna, how are you feeling?


00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,590
It was you, wasn't it?


00:08:58, --> 00:09:00,1
You made us lose the game.


00:09:00,5 --> 00:09:01,5
No.


00:09:02, --> 00:09:03,650
It was your wish.


00:09:04, --> 00:09:06,090
I just carried it out.


00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,
But I wanted to be the best on the team.


00:09:08, --> 00:09:11,2
I was the best, all right.


00:09:11, --> 00:09:13,050
Because everyone else was terrible.


00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,390
Well, wishes are complicated.


00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,0
Magic isn't an exact science, you know.


00:09:18,5 --> 00:09:20,
I mean, I did the best that I could.


00:09:20, --> 00:09:21,030
Great.


00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,9
I know you're upset, Samantha.


00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,390
That's why I'm here.


00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,8
The next time, you must be
very careful what you wish for.


00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,990
And very clear how you phrase it.


00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,970
Do you have another wish?


00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,950
Not right now, thank you.


00:09:38, --> 00:09:39,
I've got to go.


00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,840
This weird lady said it was hers,


00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:48,325
and then she gave it back to you?


00:09:49, --> 00:09:50,
Yeah.


00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
What's your problem?


00:09:52, --> 00:09:53,
Our problem is you.


00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,360
When are you going to quit the team?


00:09:57, --> 00:09:58,740
It's your fault we lost yesterday.


00:09:59,000 --> 00::01,
I didn't see you two make any great plays.


00::01,405 --> 00::04,360
That's because we spent our
time covering for Birdbrain here.


00::05,240 --> 00::07,020
Just leave me alone.


00::07,021 --> 00::09,020
I wish everyone would just buzz.


00::27, --> 00::28,
Rory?


00::29, --> 00::30,
Judith?


00::30,600 --> 00::31,600
Anna?


00::53,0 --> 00::55,670
Please, is anybody here?


00::56,630 --> 00::58,330
I didn't mean it.


00::58,4 --> 00::59,
Really, I'm sorry.


00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,291
Mr. Johnson, I... Oh.


00:11:14, --> 00:11:51,020
I didn't mean it, Clarissa.


00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,380
Not everyone.


00:11:55, --> 00:11:57,
Hello? Anybody there?


00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:,740
Bobby!


00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,250
My goodness.


00:12:26, --> 00:12:27,
Sorry.


00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,
Look what you've done.


00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,030
I knew you'd be unhappy with your wish.


00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:35,750
It's all Judith's fault.


00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,030
If she weren't so mean...


00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,
I never meant to turn anyone into a fly.


00:12:41,4 --> 00:12:42,4
I know.


00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,850
But remember what you said.


00:12:45,9 --> 00:12:46,590
Buzz off?


00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,930
Mm-hmm.


00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,
I followed your
instructions as best I could.


00:12:51,9 --> 00:12:53,790
I do have some power, Sam.


00:12:56, --> 00:12:57,670
I'm not a mind reader.


00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
I do as I'm asked.


00:13:02, --> 00:13:04,7
But what good is a wish
if it always backfires?


00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,5
They don't always backfire.


00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,3
Anyway, you still have one more wish.


00:13:12, --> 00:13:13,
Only you must be careful.


00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,350
This is your last wish.


00:13:21,9 --> 00:13:23,270
I wish...


00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,390
Right, I have to get this one right.


00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,8
Take your time.


00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,070
I've got my wish.


00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,070
Here.


00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,070
Tell me your wish.


00:13:52, --> 00:13:54,970
I wish everything to go back to normal.


00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,370
The way it was before the flies.


00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,970
Except I want Judith to be my friend.


00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:03,950
All right.


00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,230
No, wait.


00:14:06, --> 00:14:08,770
I want Judith to think I'm the greatest.


00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,870
I understand.


00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,620
Who are you talking to, honey?


00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
Is Dad okay?


00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:29,345
Of course. He's in the living room.


00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Hello?


00:14:37, --> 00:14:38,
One moment, please.


00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,
Someone by the name of Judith?


00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,720
Sam, over here.


00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,360
How do you like it? I made it just for you.


00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,940
It's good.


00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,660
And how do you like this?


00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,060
Great.


00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:58,
It's just like yours.


00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,960
Come on, ladies.
We've got a lot of work to do.


00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Sam? Judith?


00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,640
What are you waiting for? Hustle up now.


00:15:09, --> 00:15:11,860
Here, let me get you a clean uniform.


00:15:15, --> 00:15:17,280
Hello. It doesn't matter what Bird wears.


00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,020
She's a walking catastrophe.


00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,6
And what have you done with your hair?


00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,380
Don't you love it? It's just like Sam's.

208
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,320
Anybody home?

209
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,900
Can you help me?

2
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,980
Me? I'll help you.

211
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
You're a natural.

212
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,800
Show me how you do it.

213
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,220
Okay.

214
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,260
Sure.

215
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,080
Tough break.

216
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,320
That's how I weld my machine.

217
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
Judith!

218
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,020
What are you going to have?

219
00:16:01, --> 00:16:03,
I don't know. What are you going to have?

220
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,
Whatever you have.

221
00:16:04, --> 00:16:05,900
You have such great taste.

222
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,060
Yeah.

223
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,000
On the weekend, we can go shopping.

224
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,900
I mean, you have to tell me
where you get your shoes.

225
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,740
They're just your basic shoes.

226
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,440
But I love the color.

227
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,320
Yeah. Basic black.

228
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,020
Have you ever noticed how Sam
has the coolest colored pencils?

229
00:16:25, --> 00:16:27,280
I was just going to say.

230
00:16:27, --> 00:16:29,980
She can do so much with
your eight basic colors.

231
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,760
Sam, can I talk to you?

232
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,
Sure. Alone?

233
00:16:36,6 --> 00:16:38,020
Oh, hey, sure.

234
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,820
Listen, Sam, I'll catch you later.

235
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,440
Maybe we can study together tonight?

236
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,300
I think I'll be busy. Sorry.

237
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,260
That's cool. Whatever.

238
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Later.

239
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,590
What's going on?

240
00:16:54, --> 00:16:55,
What's up with her?

241
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,700
You wouldn't believe it.

242
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,960
It's my...

243
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,730
It must have been something I said.

244
00:17:01, --> 00:17:02,860
It feels like something I ate.

245
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,980
Well, what do I do?

246
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:11,300
Well, if your old worst
enemy is your new best friend,

247
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
shouldn't you be happier?

248
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,730
It's just me, Judith.

249
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,430
What are you doing here?

250
00:17:55, --> 00:17:56,850
I snuck in, hid in your closet.

251
00:17:58, --> 00:17:58,8
What, are you nuts?

252
00:17:58,9 --> 00:18:00,
You said we could study together later.

253
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,750
Not tonight. It's way too late.

254
00:18:03, --> 00:18:05,230
Sam, are you talking on the phone?

255
00:18:05, --> 00:18:07,230
No, Mom. It's okay.

256
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,730
You know you're not allowed
on the phone after light's out.

257
00:18:,240 --> 00:18:11,830
Yeah. Good night, Mom.

258
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,070
I just love your room.

259
00:18:15, --> 00:18:17,2
These sheets are so cool.

260
00:18:17, --> 00:18:18,
Shut up.

261
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,
You have to be completely quiet

262
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,650
till I can find a way
to get you out of here.

263
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,890
Sorry.

264
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,800
Bye, Mom. I'll see you after school.

265
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Have a good day, dear.

266
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
Hi.

267
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,830
I thought maybe we could
walk to school together.

268
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
No.

269
00:18:40,0 --> 00:18:41,680
Sam, wait. What's the matter?

270
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,240
I thought we were best friends.

271
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Shortcut.

272
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,760
Stop bothering me.

273
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,780
What do you mean?

274
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Oh.

275
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
You.

276
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,380
I know. I know. I know.

277
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,030
You're still unhappy.

278
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,880
Your wishes have ruined my life.

279
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:07,881
Hello, everyone.

280
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh, I don't want you to be unhappy.

281
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,800
I was only trying to...

282
00:19:14, --> 00:19:15,300
repay your kindness.

283
00:19:15, --> 00:19:16,840
I wish I'd never met you.

284
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,636
What are you guys talking about?

285
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,
If that is what you desire,

286
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,060
I will cancel your last wish
and give you another chance.

287
00:19:24, --> 00:19:26,000
Sam, you know the most interesting people.

288
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
It is my desire.

289
00:19:28, --> 00:19:29,
Then make your wish.

290
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,240
Here's my wish.

291
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,060
I wish I'd never met you.

292
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,740
Is that your wish?

293
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,760
No. Here's my full wish.

294
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,820
I wish I'd get lost.

295
00:19:45, --> 00:19:46,640
Is she the greatest?

296
00:19:47, --> 00:19:48,320
I wish I'd never met you.

297
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:53,020
I wish you met Judith instead.

298
00:20:18, --> 00:20:20,
So, you know what you're gonna wish for?

299
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,060
What are you doing here, bird?

300
00:20:26,2 --> 00:20:28,
Lose your compass on your migration?

301
00:20:29, --> 00:20:30,
She's back.

302
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,220
If you don't mind, I'm trying to
have a private conversation here.

303
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
Oh, sure.

304
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,040
I wish...

305
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,940
that wherever I was,

306
00:20:45, --> 00:20:47,400
people would gather around and admire me.

307
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:57,
Oh, look.

308
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
How beautiful.

309
00:20:59, --> 00:21:00,
It's lovely.

1
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,
Welcome back to DROD!

2
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,
DROD!

3
00:00:26, --> 00:00:26,920
DROD!

4
00:00:27, --> 00:00:28,
DROD!

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
DROD!

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,060
DROD!

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,960
DROD!

8
00:00:37,961 --> 00:01:07,940
Welcome back to DROD!

9
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
Give it to me!


00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,840
I have a few years left.

11
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,380
Thanks for dropping by, mutant.

12
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,
Another victory over evil
for the League of Good Guys.

13
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,960
I'll try not to leave any squid marks.

14
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,060
Skipper, Dad's home!

15
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:42,320
I don't think you want
him to see you reading that.

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,
But, Mom, the masked mutant
mutated into a giant squid.

17
00:01:47,5 --> 00:01:49,
Look, he's the galloping
gazelle on a death grip.

18
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Oh, dear.

19
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:51,880
Just let me finish it, okay?

20
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,
Well, um...

21
00:01:57, --> 00:02:01,080
Skipper, what did I say
about those comic books?

22
00:02:01, --> 00:02:04,700
No reading comic books till
all your homework is finished.

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,836
Is all his homework finished?

24
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,420
Hello, dear.

25
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:07,780
Is all your homework finished?

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:,
Well, not all of it.

27
00:02:,660 --> 00:02:12,640
Well, why do you think
your grades are so poor?

28
00:02:12,9 --> 00:02:14,
Why do you think his grades are so poor?

29
00:02:14, --> 00:02:18,280
Because he spends all his
time buried in a comic book.

30
00:02:18, --> 00:02:20,000
But, Dad, I don't just read them.

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
I collect them.

32
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,880
See, like this silver swan.

33
00:02:25, --> 00:02:26,340
This is a first edition.

34
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,056
Do you know how much this thing's worth?

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,720
Well, how much?

36
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,
That is not the point.

37
00:02:31, --> 00:02:33,900
Your obsession with these
things, you know, it's unhealthy.

38
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,840
You don't pay attention to anything else.

39
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:37,
He doesn't pay attention to anything else.

40
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,020
Well, Skipper, try to pay
attention to something else.

41
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,820
What did you say?

42
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,
Skipper!

43
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,240
Yeah?

44
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,260
Dinner time.

45
00:02:45, --> 00:02:46,
Oh, yes.

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,440
Jumping jelly beans.

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,840
I tell you, those things
are going to ruin that kid.

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Oh, hush.

49
00:02:52, --> 00:02:54,600
It's only a comic book.

50
00:02:55, --> 00:02:56,
Yeah.

51
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Hey, Wilson.

52
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,740
You have to check this out.

53
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:18,741
Look.

54
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,956
It's the first time they've shown the
secret headquarters of the Masked Mutants.

55
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,980
Oh, great.

56
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,866
In issue 12, page 4,
panel 3, he talked about

57
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:28,380
his headquarters, but
they never showed it.

58
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,
Which one is he again?

59
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,
Which one is he again?

60
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,640
Oh, man, Wilson, I don't believe you.

61
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,880
Come on.

62
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,280
The Masked Mutant is the most
evil comic book villain there is.

63
00:03:39, --> 00:03:40,600
Hey, wait a minute.

64
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,
See this blue rock I found?

65
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,020
Look.

66
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,
What's so great about that?

67
00:03:48,1 --> 00:03:51,380
Well, if you hold it like
this, it looks like a duck.

68
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,300
It does?

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,220
I did this morning.

70
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,640
Hey, I'm going to look for
some more rocks after school.

71
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,860
Do you want to come?

72
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,
No, I've got to catch a bus.

73
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,
I've got another orthodontist appointment.

74
00:04:06, --> 00:04:07,781
Why do you collect rocks anyway?

75
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,340
I don't know.

76
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:,420
They're easy to find.

77
00:04:, --> 00:04:13,000
No matter where you are,
you're always near a rock.

78
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,960
I don't get what the big
deal about comic books is.

79
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,
Well, I'm going to get you and your rocks.

80
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,260
Hey, what did you get?

81
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
A tuna.

82
00:04:26,0 --> 00:04:27,0
Yeah, me too.

83
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,220
Want to trade?

84
00:04:28, --> 00:04:29,
What for?

85
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I don't know.

86
00:04:32, --> 00:04:33,
Okay.

87
00:04:45, --> 00:04:46,390
What are you looking at?

88
00:04:47, --> 00:04:51,230
I don't know.
It just feels like someone's watching me.

89
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,
Still don't see anyone.

90
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,590
Hey, what was it he described?

91
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,030
What?

92
00:05:11,4 --> 00:05:12,4
Me?

93
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,930
I wasn't talking to the empty seat.

94
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,090
Yeah, I'd go there.

95
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,370
How is it?

96
00:05:25,9 --> 00:05:27,270
I don't know. It's an okay school.

97
00:05:28, --> 00:05:30,0
I didn't mean to interrupt your reading.

98
00:05:30,7 --> 00:05:32,670
Oh, that's okay. I've read it four times.

99
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,790
My name's Libby.

0
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,070
I'm Skipper.

1
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,990
Do you collect comic books?

2
00:05:37, --> 00:05:37,890
Yeah.

3
00:05:38,2 --> 00:05:39,2
So do I.

4
00:05:39,4 --> 00:05:39,990
What kind?

5
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,7
High school Harry and Beanhead.

6
00:05:41,8 --> 00:05:43,
Oh, man, those are the worst.

7
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,4
I think they're very well
written and they're funny.

8
00:05:46, --> 00:05:47,230
Yeah, right.

9
00:05:47,5 --> 00:05:49,
High school Harry
with those stupid little

1
00:05:49, --> 00:05:51,730
tic-tac-toe check marks
all over his temples.


00:05:52,1 --> 00:05:54,390
And that guy Beanhead, so nauseating.


00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:56,0
What do you collect?


00:05:56, --> 00:05:57,
All that superhero junk?


00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,090
Like the masked mutant?


00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,
Yeah, I know everything about the mutant.


00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,630
He's the most evil
supervillain of them all.


00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,
I mean, look at this artwork.


00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,990
It's way better than the
high school Harry comics.


00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,070
There's no contest.


00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,690
See, the mutant's
been battling the gazelle.


00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,090
The galloping gazelle.


00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,430
Galloping gazelle?


00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,030
Talk about dumb.


00:06:16, --> 00:06:17,2
It's not dumb, Libby.


00:06:17, --> 00:06:19,050
The gazelle's at the end of his career.


00:06:19, --> 00:06:21,
He has to battle the mutant
for the fate of the planet.


00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,970
What's so dumb about that?


00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,090
Are all the boys at Franklin like you?


00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,590
Nah, I'm the coolest.


00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,9
Oh, man, I missed my stop.


00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,
Nice meeting you.


00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,630
See you again sometime.


00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,800
The mutant's headquarters.


00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
It can't be.


00:08:06, --> 00:08:07,
I'm telling you.


00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,
It was that exact same building.


00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,700
But that's impossible.


00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,060
It's from a comic book.


00:08:13, --> 00:08:13,800
Man.


00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,380
Got it.


00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Solve the mystery.


00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,360
Who draws the masked mutant?


00:08:20,0 --> 00:08:21,0
Who's the artist?


00:08:22, --> 00:08:23,380
Wilson, it's Ernie Atwater.


00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,980
Come on, everybody knows that.


00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,720
Well, I'll bet that guy,
Atwater, was here one day.


00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,
Ernie Atwater?


00:08:31, --> 00:08:32,720
Is Atwater coming to Terrington?


00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Sure.


00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Let's say he's here.


00:08:36, --> 00:08:37,661
He's driving down the street.


00:08:38,0 --> 00:08:39,600
And he sees this weird building.


00:08:40, --> 00:08:42,
And he thinks, what a great building.


00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,
And it'd be perfect for the secret
headquarters of the masked mutant.


00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,
So he copied it from the comic book.


00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,860
Yeah, I guess that's possible.


00:08:51, --> 00:08:51,420
What?


00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,625
Did you think it was the
mutant's headquarters?


00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He's a comic book character, remember?


00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,620
Yeah, I guess you're right.


00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,
Okie dokie, Wilson.


00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,280
I think you should probably go home.


00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,800
Skipper's got to get to his homework.


00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,980
You need two hands.


00:09:06, --> 00:09:07,
Yeah.


00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Want a rock?


00:09:,020 --> 00:09:11,020
Not real.


00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,
Later.


00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
See you, Wilson.


00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,380
Strange.


00:09:18, --> 00:09:19,
Okay.


00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Up with the comic books.


00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,
Time for homework.


00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,660
Okay, Dad.


00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,790
Katya.


00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,990
I'm sorry, Dad.


00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,3
I know I shouldn't be sleeping.


00:09:48, --> 00:09:49,8
I just couldn't put this down.


00:09:52, --> 00:09:52,9
Algebra?


00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:54,
You weren't reading a comic book?


00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,050
No.


00::00,090 --> 00::02,829
Skipper, I can't tell you
how happy I am to see that


00::02,841 --> 00::05,9
you're interested in something
besides that masked mutant.


00::06,670 --> 00::06,950
Yeah.


00::07,390 --> 00::08,390
Well, goodnight, Dad.


00::09, --> 00::11,
You know, I was starting
to worry about you, son.


00::11,2 --> 00::11,690
Okay, Dad.


00::12,070 --> 00::12,690
Well, goodnight.


00::12,930 --> 00::15,
Oh, yeah, you've got to get to
sleep because you've got that early


00::15, --> 00::17,276
follow-up appointment with your
orthodontist tomorrow morning.


00::17,300 --> 00::18,740
You've got to be on the bus by 6.30.


00::19, --> 00::21,020
Even earlier if I want
to see the headquarters.


00::22, --> 00::23,790
I mean, I...


00::24, --> 00::26,370
What headquarters?
What are you talking about?


00::27,990 --> 00::28,350
I...


00::28,830 --> 00::30,7
Dad, were you ever good at algebra?


00::32,1 --> 00::33,1
Uh, me?


00::34,070 --> 00::34,430
Uh...


00::34,655 --> 00::35,655
Uh, golly, no.


00::36,390 --> 00::37,0
No, no.


00::37,1 --> 00::38,1
Okay.


00::38,270 --> 00::40,
But I'm glad to see that you're
finding it interesting now, yeah.


00::40, --> 00::41,
Yeah.


00::44,240 --> 00::44,780
Goodnight.


00::45,240 --> 00::45,780
Goodnight, Dad.


00::46, --> 00::47,
Uh-huh.


00::56,040 --> 00::57,
I've just got to see this place again.

208
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,330
That's weird.

209
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,290
It was right there. I know it was.

2
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,830
Hey, did you see a building there?

211
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,930
Building where?

212
00:11:23,9 --> 00:11:24,9
Right there.

213
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,730
Yesterday, it was right on that spot.

214
00:11:27,7 --> 00:11:28,970
It looked like this.

215
00:11:30, --> 00:11:31,
No wonder you're seeing things.

216
00:11:31, --> 00:11:33,870
This stuff will rot your mind.

217
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Oh!

218
00:12:00, --> 00:12:02,620
There was some mail for you, Skipper.

219
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,620
I wasn't expecting anything.

220
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,
Oh.

221
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,240
Well, it says special edition.

222
00:12:11, --> 00:12:12,380
I've never done that before.

223
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,940
It can't be.

224
00:12:25, --> 00:12:27,
It's not possible.

225
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,680
It's not possible. No way.

226
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Well, listen.

227
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,720
Look what the mutant's saying.

228
00:12:36,0 --> 00:12:37,740
I'm tracking each one of them.

229
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,
They'll never find me.

230
00:12:39, --> 00:12:42,700
I've thrown an invisibility curtain
around my entire headquarters.

231
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,
I know, but it's a comic book, Skipper.

232
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,360
But I saw this building myself.

233
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,
And then the next day, it was gone.

234
00:12:49, --> 00:12:50,
And now this.

235
00:12:50, --> 00:12:52,420
What if there really is
an invisibility curtain?

236
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,060
There's no such thing.

237
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,440
Then what happened?

238
00:12:56, --> 00:12:56,900
I don't know.

239
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,920
There's got to be a logical explanation.

240
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,380
I'm going to find out what it is.

241
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:16,
The mutant!

242
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,
Are you jumpy or what?

243
00:13:19,8 --> 00:13:20,8
It's not funny.

244
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,4
Look, the building was there yesterday.

245
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,
It was?

246
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,950
I've never seen it.

247
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:26,990
You haven't?

248
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,390
I don't think so.

249
00:13:29, --> 00:13:30,690
Well, I have.

250
00:13:31,1 --> 00:13:33,070
Here, take a look at this.

251
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:35,0
An invisibility curtain?

252
00:13:36,4 --> 00:13:38,070
Now I know why they call you Skipper.

253
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,5
When they handed out
brains, you got skipped.

254
00:13:41,8 --> 00:13:43,670
Well, you have to admit this is weird.

255
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,270
I'll admit that you're weird.

256
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,7
In the comic book, people could walk
right through the invisibility curtain.

257
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:51,
And they couldn't see it or anything.

258
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,9
It was kind of like walking
through a smoke screen.

259
00:13:55, --> 00:13:58,231
And once you've walked through
the curtain, you can see the building.

260
00:13:58,9 --> 00:14:00,8
Okay, let's get this over with.

261
00:14:01,1 --> 00:14:05,090
Then when you see that you're nuts,
we can have a normal conversation.

262
00:14:05, --> 00:14:06,
Come on.

263
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,330
We are now stepping
through the invisibility curtain.

264
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,670
Very funny.

265
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,2
You were right.

266
00:14:20,1 --> 00:14:21,
Now what?

267
00:14:21, --> 00:14:23,030
Let's get out of here, okay?

268
00:14:23,6 --> 00:14:24,6
No way.

269
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,070
Come on, let's go in.

270
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,690
Go in? Are you crazy?

271
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:30,050
No, don't even start to think about it.

272
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,250
Just go.

273
00:14:43,0 --> 00:14:44,
Where is everyone?

274
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,670
I don't know.

275
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,
What was that?

276
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
It was what?

277
00:14:54,0 --> 00:14:55,320
Didn't you feel that?

278
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,000
I didn't feel anything.

279
00:14:57, --> 00:14:59,080
Are you trying to scare me or something?

280
00:14:59, --> 00:15:01,
No, there was an electrical beam.

281
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,080
It shined on me when I stepped forward.

282
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,020
Let's get out of here.

283
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,600
It's so quiet, it's creepy.

284
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,880
Well, there was a beam sort of like
that in one of the Avenging Eagle comics.

285
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,760
I think it was issue four.

286
00:15:16, --> 00:15:18,640
It was a beam that led
to a parallel dimension.

287
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,380
But it wasn't like that.

288
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,780
I feel like I'm standing
in a giant box of crayons.

289
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,
I think it's awesome.

290
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,0
Hello?

291
00:15:32,1 --> 00:15:33,1
Hello?

292
00:15:42, --> 00:15:46,340
You think this is the secret
headquarters of that mighty mutator?

293
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,220
It's the mass mutant.

294
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,780
Will you please get that straight?

295
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,620
And what if it is?

296
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,
How else could you
explain the invisibility curtain?

297
00:15:54, --> 00:15:55,740
I can't explain it.

298
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,640
It's weird, it's too weird.

299
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,420
Well, there's only one way
to find out the truth, right?

300
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
No way.

301
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:,270
Okay, Libby, let's go.

302
00:16:,370 --> 00:16:14,430
You really think a comic book
character can come to life?

303
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,
That's sad, that's really sad.

304
00:16:18, --> 00:16:19,690
Don't make me cry.

305
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,050
Come on, let's go.

306
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:25,090
Okay, but if this mutant
creep shows up, I'm out of here.

307
00:16:25, --> 00:16:26,890
I thought you didn't believe it.

308
00:16:27, --> 00:16:28,
I don't.

309
00:16:28, --> 00:16:30,
Okay, top floor.

310
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,840
Now!

311
00:16:37, --> 00:16:38,420
This is going too fast.

312
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Hang on to something.

313
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
I'm going to crash.

314
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,660
Are you okay?

315
00:16:56, --> 00:16:57,
I think so.

316
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,840
I pushed up.

317
00:16:59, --> 00:17:00,
We should have gone up.

318
00:17:03, --> 00:17:04,280
What's wrong?

319
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,660
Nothing, I just feel funny.

320
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,740
Kind of tingly.

321
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:12,600
Libby, I'll be okay.

322
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,340
Why doesn't the door open?

323
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
Open?

324
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,
We're trapped in here.

325
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,980
Don't worry, they're just slow.

326
00:17:22, --> 00:17:23,
They'll open, watch.

327
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,060
We'll be trapped in here forever.

328
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,960
The air will run out, we'll suffocate.

329
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,
I can't breathe, Skipper.

330
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,900
I can't breathe.

331
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Oh.

332
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,050
Where are we?

333
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,780
Basement, I guess.

334
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,210
What's down here?

335
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,
Let's go back up.

336
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Hang on.

337
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,870
Come on, Skipper.

338
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,750
Let's go back up now.

339
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,
Okay, calm down.

340
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
An emergency.

341
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,440
I don't believe this.

342
00:18:24, --> 00:18:26,260
Let's find another elevator.

343
00:18:27, --> 00:18:28,
Okay.

344
00:18:34, --> 00:18:36,
Oh, man.

345
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,060
Just great.

346
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,700
Do you see any elevators?

347
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,860
I don't see anything.

348
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,000
Maybe the other elevators
don't even come down this far.

349
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,780
There's a furnace.

350
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,940
It was just a furnace.

351
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,660
Come on, let's find some stairs.

352
00:19:14, --> 00:19:16,870
There's got to be a way out of this place.

353
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,770
Libby?

354
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,630
Libby?

355
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,060
Libby, is that you?

356
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,860
Libby?

357
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:41,861
Libby?

358
00:19:46, --> 00:19:47,
Libby?

359
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,980
Libby, are you down here?

360
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,620
Basement?

361
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,
What do you think of good guys?

362
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,440
This must be where they
make the comic books.

363
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,810
It's me.

364
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,750
Why did they picture me?

365
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,850
Who's there?

366
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,850
Libby? Libby, is that you?

367
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,870
Libby?

368
00:21:09, --> 00:21:10,
Are you down here?

1
00:00:08, --> 00:00:38,
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,
I didn't mean to interrupt your reading.

3
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
My name's Libby.

4
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,
I'm Skipper.

5
00:01:10, --> 00:01:12,
Do you collect comic books?

6
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:12,960
Yeah.

7
00:01:13, --> 00:01:14,
The masked mutant?

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,
I know everything about the mutant.

9
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,260
He's the most evil
supervillain of them all.

10
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,320
The mutant's headquarters.

11
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,680
Look what the mutant said.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,700
I'm tracking each one of them.

13
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,
I've thrown an invisibility curtain
around my entire headquarters.

14
00:01:30, --> 00:01:33,000
We are now stepping
through the invisibility curtain.

15
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
Very funny.

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,
This must be where they
make the comic books.

17
00:01:45, --> 00:01:46,340
It's me.

18
00:01:48, --> 00:01:49,680
Who's there?

19
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,
Libby?

20
00:01:52, --> 00:01:53,660
Libby, is that you?

21
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,740
Libby?

22
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
No!

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
Please!

24
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,340
Please what?

25
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,600
Please don't threaten me
with a cardboard cutout?

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Huh?

27
00:02:09, --> 00:02:10,
What?

28
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
What?

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,
Where did you get that?

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Down a hallway.

31
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,740
And I also found another elevator.

32
00:02:19, --> 00:02:20,320
Now we can get out of here.

33
00:02:20, --> 00:02:20,920
Oh, good.

34
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,440
Let's go.

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,420
Oh, wait.

36
00:02:22, --> 00:02:23,
I've got to check this out.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,960
I found one of these drawings.

38
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,220
And the drawings are me.

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,860
They were right here.

40
00:02:30, --> 00:02:31,
I swear.

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Come on, Skipper.

42
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,240
Let's go.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,640
We've fooled around long enough.

44
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,
I'm not kidding, Libby.

45
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,020
Come on.

46
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,
Come on.

47
00:02:36, --> 00:02:37,
The elevator's waiting.

48
00:02:38, --> 00:02:38,600
But...

49
00:02:39, --> 00:02:40,280
Come on, Skipper.

50
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Come on.

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Libby!

52
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,420
Libby!

53
00:02:49, --> 00:02:50,680
Libby, wait up!

54
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,620
I've got to get home.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,
My mom's going to have a cow.

56
00:02:54, --> 00:02:55,880
You have to believe me.

57
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,360
There were drawings of me in there.

58
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,040
Great.

59
00:02:58, --> 00:02:58,400
Whatever.

60
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:58,980
Look.

61
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,740
This whole thing's too weird for me.

62
00:03:01, --> 00:03:01,800
I've got to go.

63
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
See you around.

64
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,061
Is there something wrong
with the spaghetti, Skipper?

65
00:03:20, --> 00:03:21,
Oh, no.

66
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,860
I'm just not that hungry.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,680
There's a first.

68
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,
Mark it on the calendar.

69
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,280
The weirdest thing happened today.

70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,220
Oh, by the way.

71
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,720
I'm driving to work this morning.

72
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,
And what do I hear on the radio?

73
00:03:31, --> 00:03:31,800
What?

74
00:03:32, --> 00:03:35,380
A child psychologist is
talking about how he thinks

75
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,720
that some kids get so
involved in comic books.

76
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,420
that they start living in their fantasies.

77
00:03:41, --> 00:03:43,360
Now, is that what I have
been saying or what?

78
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,840
That's what you've been saying?

79
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,720
And what were you about to say, Skipper?

80
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,
Oh, I...

81
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
I forget, Mom.

82
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:53,040
Are you feeling all right, dear?

83
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,
Yeah, I feel okay.

84
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,
I'm just, you know, kind of tired.

85
00:03:58, --> 00:03:59,
I'm going to go to bed.

86
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
Good night.

87
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,
What were you talking about?

88
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,680
Maybe you're going nuts.

89
00:04:12, --> 00:04:13,980
I swear I saw them.

90
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,
They were drawings of me.

91
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,800
They even drew my braces.

92
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,720
Too bad you don't have one
of those drawings to show me.

93
00:04:20, --> 00:04:21,301
You don't believe me either?

94
00:04:21, --> 00:04:23,600
Well, I'm not saying you're lying.

95
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,680
And what about the invisibility curtain?

96
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,
Am I just imagining that, too?

97
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,
You know, that's what I like
about collecting my rocks.

98
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,
There's nothing weird about them.

99
00:04:33, --> 00:04:34,820
No invisible rocks.


00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,840
No rocks that look like me.


00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,970
I like that about them.


00:04:39, --> 00:04:40,
I don't know.


00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,840
Maybe I am going crazy.


00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,600
It's like I don't know what's real anymore.


00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,320
It's like my Uncle Ralph.


00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,780
First, he started seeing
things that weren't there.


00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,980
Then he started smelling things.


00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
Then they took them away.


00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Skipper?


00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,340
Skipper?


00:04:59, --> 00:05:00,
Skipper!


00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,780
Yeah, Dad?


00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,881
What is the matter with you?


00:05:04, --> 00:05:05,640
I don't know.


00:05:06, --> 00:05:07,
Are you sick?


00:05:07, --> 00:05:07,
No.


00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,020
You're sweating.


00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,260
I'm okay, Dad.


00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,
Gosh.


00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,000
You know, I don't want
you spending so much


00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:16,081
time on algebra you
don't get enough sleep.


00:05:16, --> 00:05:17,
Okay.


00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,
Here's some mail for you.


00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,
Okay.


00:05:33, --> 00:05:34,
What is it?


00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,720
One of your comic books.


00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,940
That ought to cheer you up.


00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,240
Oh.


00:05:37, --> 00:05:40,820
But, uh, you do your homework first, huh?


00:05:41, --> 00:05:42,
Okay.


00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:47,400
A new foe for the mutant?


00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,710
That's me.


00:06:06, --> 00:06:08,
The boy sneaked down the hallway.


00:06:09, --> 00:06:11,430
He knew that at any moment
he could be destroyed.


00:06:12, --> 00:06:13,
This is crazy.


00:06:17, --> 00:06:21,
Two more minutes and
I'll be a grilled gazelle.


00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,
Only the boy can save me now.


00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,720
Only the boy can save the
world from the mass mutant's evil.


00:06:29, --> 00:06:30,240
But where is he?


00:06:32, --> 00:06:33,400
I'm right here.


00:06:35, --> 00:06:36,
This is insane.


00:06:37, --> 00:06:37,760
Mom!


00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Dad!


00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,
I'm inside this comic book.


00:06:48, --> 00:06:49,
Not now.


00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,970
Dad, you've got to see this.


00:06:53, --> 00:06:55,
Oh, did you get a letter
to the editor published?


00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:55,830
There's from him.


00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:56,630
No, Dad, look.


00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,270
I'm in the comic book.


00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,270
I can't see a thing.


00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,766
Will you get that thing away from me?


00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,686
Can't you see what these
onions are doing to my eyes?


00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,
Oh, well, there's a
trick to cutting onions.


00:07:05, --> 00:07:06,910
You have no idea what it is.


00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,410
Oh, forget it.


00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,670
Oh, well.


00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,710
Oh, honey.


00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,910
Hey, kid.


00:07:21, --> 00:07:22,430
You all by yourself?


00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:23,431
Huh?


00:07:23, --> 00:07:24,950
Somebody picking you up.


00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,650
Oh, no.


00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,830
You know, this part of town is not
a good place for a kid to be at night.


00:07:30, --> 00:07:32,070
Yeah, well, there's something I have to do.


00:07:33, --> 00:07:34,
Into comic books?


00:07:35, --> 00:07:36,
Yeah.


00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,950
You've got to be careful with those things.


00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,610
They can warp your mind.


00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,870
Okay.


00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,070
Hey, kid.


00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,410
Be careful out there.


00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,
Be real careful.


00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,680
That's just too weird.


00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,020
Hello?


00:09:39, --> 00:09:40,
Hello?


00:09:41, --> 00:09:42,
Help.


00:10:01, --> 00:10:02,
Hey, kid.


00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,600
What took you so long?


00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,
Don't you know you have
to help me save the world?


00:10:16, --> 00:10:17,860
You're the galloping gazelle.


00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,060
You're real.


00:10:19, --> 00:10:20,
Real tired of waiting?


00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,
Turn that heat off.


00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Come on, I'm broiling.


00:10:28, --> 00:10:30,
Now, untie me.


00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,340
We have to hurry.


00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,
I can't believe this.


00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,
I'll give you my autograph later.


00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:34,980
Hurry up.


00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
We don't have much time.


00:10:36, --> 00:10:36,960
Time?


00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,680
He'll be back.


00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,
We want to get him
before he gets to us, right?


00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,600
Us?


00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,
You're the kid, aren't you?


00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,
You're the one who's supposed to
help me fight the evil forces, aren't you?


00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,040
Right.


00:10:46, --> 00:10:47,
What's your name?


00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,660
Skipper.


00:10:49, --> 00:10:50,800
Weird name for a superhero.


00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,060
Just untie me, would you?


00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,
How old are you, kid?


00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
Eight, nine?


00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
I'm twelve.


00:11:00, --> 00:11:01,620
Hey, don't get an attitude.


00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,260
Gazelle, it's a league of good guys.

208
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,880
Gazelle, it's a league of good guys.

209
00:11:10, --> 00:11:11,
Heck's sakes, he jabbed it.

210
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,340
Come on, kid.

211
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
Hurry up.

212
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,
How'd you find the secret
headquarters, anyway?

213
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,020
You used your secret
cyber radar powers, right?

214
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,
Or your ultraline control to read
my thoughts and hurry to my rescue?

215
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,
No, I... I just took the bus.

216
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
There.

217
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Thanks, kid.

218
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,
Now, let's pay him a surprise visit.

219
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Come on!

220
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,600
Coming?

221
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,620
Uh, can't we take an elevator?

222
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,420
No climbing abilities, huh?

223
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:56,960
You know, kid, if you're gonna be a
superhero, you gotta start working out.

224
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,340
Huh?

225
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,020
All right, we'll take the stairs.

226
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,960
Take your time, take your time.

227
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,980
We only have to save the planet.

228
00:12:29, --> 00:12:31,280
Whoa, the mutant's headquarters!

229
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,
It's solar, over time.

230
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,090
Whoa!

231
00:12:46, --> 00:12:47,910
This is incredible!

232
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,590
Yeah.

233
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,290
Not nearly as impressive as the
control room for the league of good guys.

234
00:12:55, --> 00:12:57,
We have a soft drink machine.

235
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,330
What about the mass mutants?

236
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,
We'll just wait right
here and surprise them.

237
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,
Just take a little off the top.

238
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,280
Trim around the horns, please.

239
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,060
Not a very comfortable chair, either.

240
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Snake!

241
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,
There's a snake in my face!

242
00:13:27, --> 00:13:29,860
Don't worry, kid, I've got an idea.

243
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Shall I give it a whirl?

244
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,720
You don't like snakes, kid?

245
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:39,721
Ah!

246
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,820
Gee, I was just getting comfortable.

247
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,220
I'm going somewhere.

248
00:13:55, --> 00:13:57,300
Look at that wingman.

249
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,
That's it, I'm out of here.

250
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,260
Wait, where are you going?

251
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,080
He's right, I'm too old
for this superhero stuff.

252
00:14:17, --> 00:14:18,700
You're on your own, kid.

253
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:34,940
Oh, another victory for
the league of scared guys.

254
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,340
Ha ha ha!

255
00:14:40, --> 00:14:41,760
Now you.

256
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,
Look, the silver swan!

257
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,000
We've got to watch out!

258
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,
Where did he go?

259
00:14:53, --> 00:14:54,620
Where did who go?

260
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,280
Didn't you hear me call you?

261
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,
I was across the street.

262
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,020
I saw you go into the building.

263
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
Wow!

264
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,
This is so cool!

265
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,820
We've got to be careful.

266
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,420
The mutant's in here.

267
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:10,980
Wait!

268
00:15:11, --> 00:15:12,820
It could be anything.

269
00:15:13, --> 00:15:19,720
The desk, or the floor, or the
railing, or these pipes, or the ceiling.

270
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,340
I know, I know.

271
00:15:21, --> 00:15:22,
He's a mass mutant.

272
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,980
He could be anything.

273
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,060
He could even be me.

274
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,380
Maybe that's not funny.

275
00:15:29, --> 00:15:30,
There is no living.

276
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
There never was.

277
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Oh!

278
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,880
And now I must do something
very bad to you, Skipper.

279
00:15:38, --> 00:15:38,760
No, please.

280
00:15:39, --> 00:15:41,020
I'll just leave and take a bus home.

281
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,340
And I won't tell anybody.

282
00:15:42, --> 00:15:43,
Honest.

283
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,880
Unless you leave.

284
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,320
You belong here now.

285
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,720
I knew when I saw you
on that bus the first time.

286
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,040
I knew you were perfect.

287
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,
You said you knew everything about me.

288
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,420
It's so hard to find good
characters for my story.

289
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,880
It's so hard to find good foes.

290
00:16:21, --> 00:16:23,340
What are you going to do?

291
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,380
Destroy you, of course.

292
00:16:25, --> 00:16:26,
No, you can't.

293
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
You're just a character in a comic book.

294
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
But I'm real.

295
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,060
I'm a real boy.

296
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,061
No.

297
00:16:34, --> 00:16:35,320
You're not, Skipper.

298
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,220
You're not real.

299
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,900
You're a comic book character, too.

300
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,760
You're a liar.

301
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,680
Yes, I'm a liar.

302
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,040
It's one of my better qualities.

303
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,380
But I'm not lying this time.

304
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,620
You're not real anymore.

305
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,860
Not true.

306
00:16:55, --> 00:16:58,980
Remember when you entered
the building for the first time?

307
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:05,320
Remember when you walked through the glass
door and a beam of light passed over you?

308
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,320
Yeah, I remember.

309
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,
That was a scanner.

310
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,420
And when you passed through
it and scanned your entire body

311
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,360
and it turned you into tiny dots of ink?

312
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:14,740
No!

313
00:17:15, --> 00:17:18,
You're a comic book character just like me.

314
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,
Say goodbye, Skipper.

315
00:17:29, --> 00:17:31,320
Ha ha ha ha!

316
00:17:45, --> 00:17:46,340
Oh, really?

317
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,300
Then who are you?

318
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,080
I'm... I'm...

319
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,
I'm the Colossal Elastic Boy.

320
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,320
Ah, Elastic Boy.

321
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,400
I thought you looked familiar.

322
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,000
Well, goodbye, mutant.

323
00:18:00, --> 00:18:02,780
I have to go back to my
home planet of Zergos.

324
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,780
You know, I can't just
star in other comic books.

325
00:18:05,781 --> 00:18:12,320
Nice try, Elastic Boy.

326
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,800
But you invaded my secret headquarters.

327
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,
Now, I must destroy you.

328
00:18:20, --> 00:18:21,440
No, you can't!

329
00:18:22, --> 00:18:25,
I'll just stretch out my elastic
arms and I'll squeeze you into putty.

330
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,760
I don't think so.

331
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,
I'm gonna tear you into pieces
and then tear your pieces into pieces!

332
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,000
No, you can't!

333
00:18:34, --> 00:18:35,760
I'll bend, but I won't break.

334
00:18:36, --> 00:18:39,
There's only one way you
can destroy Elastic Boy.

335
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,
What's that, if you don't mind me asking?

336
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,840
Isophoric acid.

337
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,780
That's the only way you
can destroy my elastic body.

338
00:18:50, --> 00:18:51,
Ha ha ha ha!

339
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,060
Oops.

340
00:18:52, --> 00:18:54,220
I guess I shouldn't have said that.

341
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Too late!

342
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,840
Ha ha ha ha!

343
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,000
Say goodbye, Elastic Boy.

344
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:04,640
Ha ha ha ha!

345
00:19:06, --> 00:19:07,860
Ha ha ha ha!

346
00:19:08, --> 00:19:08,620
Ha ha!

347
00:19:09, --> 00:19:10,840
And there's one thing you forgot to use.

348
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,340
You can change into a solid fat.

349
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,780
But once you change
into a liquid, you're dead.

350
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,020
Ha!

351
00:19:17, --> 00:19:18,620
You tricked me!

352
00:19:19, --> 00:19:22,960
The Great Masked Mutant, tricked by a boy!

353
00:19:23, --> 00:19:24,
I'm here!

354
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,030
Yes, I've destroyed him!

355
00:19:46, --> 00:19:49,270
The most evil supervillain
to walk the planet is dead!

356
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,060
Skipper, there's mail for you again.

357
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,
If it's a comic book, you
can just throw it out, Mom.

358
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,400
Well, I'll just put it over here, and
maybe you'll change your mind.

359
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,220
Are you gonna eat your soup?

360
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,720
No, I'm not hungry.

361
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:27,
Are you feeling all right?

362
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,920
Yeah, Mom. I feel fine.

363
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,300
Skipper, what happened last night?

364
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,620
Mom, I don't want to talk about it.

365
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
I'll tell you someday.

366
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,220
What on earth have you got on your hands?

367
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
It looks like ink.

368
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Mom!

369
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,
I won't get any on the furniture.

370
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
I'm gonna go watch TV.

371
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,980
Elastic board?

372
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,840

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 You can't just walk up to an illusion and start playing around.

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 You've got to practice.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000

 You come on over here.

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 >> Guilotine, that's right.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 You see, about  years ago in France,

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 this was the equivalent of the electric chair.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 They would take your head, put your head in here like so.

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And then, yeah, that's what you think of that.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000

 Here's what we're going to do.

 Now, I just can't quite reach with my hand,

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000

 How much is it?

 I'll never be able to afford any good tricks.

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Two free tickets.

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 >> What magic words?

349
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 >> Do I have to do everything?

350
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 You want to be a magician or what?

351
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000

352
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Judy, come back from where everyone is.

355
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 >> I'm telling mom.

356
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 >> Judy, wait.

357
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 I didn't do anything.

358
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 >> Bet your glad she's back.

359
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000

360
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 We don't have much time.

361
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 >> But bet about her.

362
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Tell her your parents.

363
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 With your talent, I could use you in the act.

364
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 >> Really?

365
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 >> Of course.

366
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Kirolo, where you did that Alicuzam, you're a natural.

367
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 >> Really?

368
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 You made it on stage in your act?

369
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 >> Nightly and two shows on Saturday.

370
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 But quick, before a maze shows up into the coffin.

371
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 >> Hey, watch it.

372
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 That's my lucky foot.

373
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 >> Sorry.

374
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 You alright?

375
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 >> It's alright.

376
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 >> Alicuzam.

377
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Alicuzar gets a beer habit.

378

 Freel sent you from the skin of a remnant.

379
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 >> Who's there?

380
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Hey, it's you, a kid from the disappearing act last night.

381
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 What happened to you?

382
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Where did you go?

383
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 >> Well, I waited and then you told me to beat it.

384
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 >> I did.

385
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 I never said that.

386
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Ah, you found my magic kit, great.

387
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 >> Well, I tried a few of your tricks.

388
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 I hope you don't mind.

389
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 >> Well, that's fine.

390
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 As long as, hey, where's the rabbit?

391
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 You didn't let him out, did you?

392
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 He's very dangerous, very tricky.

393
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 He used to be an evil magician, but I changed him into a rabbit for everyone's good.

394
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 >> He said you were the evil one.

395
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 >> Yeah, he would say that.

396
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000

No, I wasn't mama honest. I

00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:57,760
Don't know why you believe in those
stories. There is no ghost in this house.

Now go to bed I.

And then what happened
what did the ghost do.

15
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,380
The ghost pulled Andrews head
off and hid it somewhere in the house

16
00:02:55,381 --> 00:03:00,060
And every night since then
Andrews ghost wanders these halls.

perhaps tonight the headless boy.

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,888
One of these days you
local kids will realize that the

24
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,920
spirits who haunt this house
do not appreciate pranks.

25
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,669

don't come back until you're

26
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,280
willing to show Hill
house the proper respect.

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,740

the look on that little girl's face?

29
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,313
We went too far that time.
She was really scared. That's the

30
00:03:57,325 --> 00:04:00,260
point Dwayne. The twin tears
of Wheeler Falls strike again.

31
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,662
Maybe we're getting
too old for this twin terror

32
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:08,901

just getting good. I know.

33
00:04:09, --> 00:04:11,000
Let's come back tomorrow night.

34
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,400
We can sneak away from the tour and
look for the head of the headless ghost.

35
00:04:18, --> 00:04:22,400
I don't know what all of a
sudden you're afraid of ghosts.

36
00:04:24, --> 00:04:28,660
You heard what Otto said the ghosts
don't appreciate you believe that I.

37
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,660
Didn't say that I just you what?

38
00:04:36, --> 00:04:40,414
Are you scared? No, it'll
be great tomorrow night.

00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:43,960
He'll house will definitely
be haunted by us.

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,020
The History of this house is
one of madness and despair.

41
00:04:57, --> 00:04:58,
Was over.

42
00:04:59, --> 00:05:06,780
 years ago that a sea captain
built this house for his lady love.

43
00:05:07, --> 00:05:10,
When he came back from
a sea voyage, he found

44
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:16,800
his beloved had left him for another man
The poor captain died of a broken heart

45
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:20,770
but his enraged spirit
lived on taking revenge

46
00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:24,590
upon anyone who dared
live in this house and

47
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,260
upon anyone who mocked.

48
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,
the ghosts within.

49
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,740
Well, I'm glad to see our regulars have
decided to behave themselves tonight.

50
00:05:38, --> 00:05:40,080
For their own sake.

51
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,380
Each of these portraits

52
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:53,800
represents some poor soul who tried to live
in this house and then died a horrible and

53
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:57,380
Grizzly death and now if you
will follow me up to the guest room

54
00:05:57,381 --> 00:06:00,640
You will hear the bloody story
of a young lad named Andrew.

55
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,340
The ghosts long icy fingers
Stretched towards the boys.

56
00:06:21, --> 00:06:24,230
The ghost pulled the boys head off.

57
00:06:29, --> 00:07:05,020
I think this place is off-limits who cares.

58
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,000
This must have been the sea captain study.

59
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,400
Oh Let's get out of here
not until we find the head.

60
00:07:28, --> 00:07:29,780
Is it here.

61
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Nope.

00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,
Oh, no, oh no.

What do we do quick in the closet.

72
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

80
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,340
Let's just get out of here.

81
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,
Do you want to see some real ghosts?

82
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,780
Who are you? My name is Seth.
I'm Stephanie and I'm did.

83
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,258
And this is Dwayne I
heard you guys talking last

84
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,700
night if you want to
see the headless ghost.

85
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,840
If the way for the house to close
up and all the tourists to go home.

86
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,760
That's when the real stuff happens.

87
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,320
And how do you know I sneaked in?

88
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,340
late one night.

89
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,260
Quick over here.

90
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,050
I.

91
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,
Know this way into the basement. Should we
sink in tonight? Yes, let's do it tonight.

92
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,994
Maybe tomorrow to be
better. Well, if the Dwayne

93
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:14,270
doesn't want to he doesn't
have to it's not everybody

94
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:18,
Can handle a real ghost
times I can handle it. I didn't say

95
00:10:18, --> 00:10:21,970
I couldn't handle it. So are
we on for tonight? Heck? Yeah.

96
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,950
Dwayne come on Dwayne.

97
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,410
It'd be a real adventure.

98
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,
Hill house awaits.

99
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,720
We don't want to wake the spirits yet.


00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,
Seeing this part of the house before


00:11:26, --> 00:11:32,910
Oh, it's not on the tour none
of these rooms are on the tour.


00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,250
Smith move.


00:11:47, --> 00:11:50,050
What's this it's called a dumbwaiter.


00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:55,
Goes all the way up to the attic it was
used to bring food up from the kitchen.


00:11:57, --> 00:11:59,390
See a long time ago.


00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,231
There was a boy who
lived in this room Hector.


00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:08,
Boy, he lost his head.
No a different boy a.


00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,370
very spoiled boy.


00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,
the love to eat ice cream.


00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,350
Strawberry ice cream.


00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,
Ice cream ice cream. He
always wanted ice cream.


00:12:20, --> 00:12:23,870
He kept the kitchen made
hopping with his demands.


00:12:25, --> 00:12:26,
ice cream.


00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,610
He just couldn't get enough ice cream.


00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:41,390
Well one day the dumbwaiter didn't come
all the way up boy reached and he reached.


00:12:42, --> 00:12:43,710
until finally.


00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,
He reached too far when the maid
found him the bottom of the shaft.


00:12:50, --> 00:12:53,850
It was hard to tell the difference
between the boy's face.


00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,050
And the strawberry ice cream.


00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,
Some say that the boy fell.


00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,830
others say.


00:13:05, --> 00:13:06,730
That he was pushed.


00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:08,825
by a ghost.


00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,050
That's just a story.


00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,
You said you were
gonna show us real ghosts.


00:13:14, --> 00:13:16,830
Do you think you're
really ready? Yes.


00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,610
Dwayne.


00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,050
You don't have to come.


00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
I'll come.


00:13:38, --> 00:13:43,400
Then we have to go one flight
up the captain's secret room.


00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,980
Come on Dwayne.


00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,031
I What's this for.


00:14:23, --> 00:14:29,
They say that the captain's ghost
paints a portrait of his latest victim.


00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,
It's getting late, maybe we
should be heading back. I'm


00:14:38, --> 00:14:42,
sorry can't let you leave.
What are you talking about?


00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
I.


00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,960
Lied to you My name isn't Seth.


00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,780
It's Andrew.


00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,920
It's been Andrew for over a hundred years.
You can't be Andrew.


00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,080
Andrew lost his head. This isn't my head.
I borrowed it. I have to return it.


00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,340
And so I'll need a new head
and guess what Dwayne.


00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,
I'm gonna take yours. I
Need your head Dwayne I.


00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
Need it.


00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,960
It won't hurt.


00:15:24, --> 00:15:25,940
Well, maybe just a little.


00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,900
Quick twist.


00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,280
Snap just like a chicken leg.


00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,
It's no joke I'm gonna
pull your head off. Wait.


00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,880
Maybe we could help you.


00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:54,940
Find your old head. Oh, it's no use for
years and years. I searched every room.


00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,880
every hallway.


00:15:57, --> 00:15:58,780
every closet.


00:16:01, --> 00:16:07,213
Well, I would take hers But it'll look kind
of funny my head's not that great either.


00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:10,760
I mean it gets allergies. It's
not that good at math and.


00:16:11, --> 00:16:16,440
It's hair never does what you wanted to it.
Nice try Dwayne, but it's no use.


00:16:17, --> 00:16:20,320
I'm gonna take your head.
That's all there is to it.


00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,600
Just hold still.


00:16:23, --> 00:16:24,
Hey.


00:16:26, --> 00:16:29,400
What were you expecting
a dish of ice cream.


00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,800
Okay, I don't have to take mine.


00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,950
Clumsy fool, it's a
head not a bowling ball.


00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,950
Oh.


00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,430
What are you looking at who me.


00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,078
Don't play innocent
with me girly girl, or you'll


00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,910
find out that my bite
is worse than my bark.


00:17:44, --> 00:17:46,
Wait a minute.


00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,920
If you're not Andrew, then who are you?
I will tell you who he is.


00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,040
He is a no-good kid who works
for me or at least he used to I.


00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,060
Have warned you about these pranks.
I shall deal with you later.


00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,245
There are many ways to
get into a room in the Hill


00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,980
House, but sometimes
there is no way to get out.


00:18:17, --> 00:18:21,960
Would you please leave us Dwayne I would
like to have a few words with Stephanie


00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:28,280
I don't look so scared Dwayne.
What's he gonna do lecture me?


00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,
You doing Otto.


00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,
Welcome aboard.


00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,630
Welcome aboard Stephanie.
I hope you like the story I told you.


00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,
About how I died you
You're the ice cream boy


00:19:03, --> 00:19:07,630
That's him. All right, and you
think he ever gives me a bite? Never


00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:13,990
I warned you to show
some respect for Hill House.


00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,
I suppose when you become a permanent
member of our little household you'll learn.


00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,820
You think she'll learn she'll learn.


00:19:41, --> 00:19:45,
She'll learn I didn't mean it.


00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,
Just another little dab around the mouth.


00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
Wayne.


00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,700
It's just the fixer-upper
we've been looking for.


00:20:51, --> 00:20:56,080
Do you understand they used to give
tours here we heard the place was haunted.


00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:03,420
Haunted right and I'm a ghost. Don't worry.
I'm sure you'll be very happy here.


00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
You.

1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:40,
Goosebumps.

2
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,010
You will beware. You're in for a scare.

3
00:01:15, --> 00:01:17,390
Worms are nature's perfect creatures.

4
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,930
They aerate the soil, recycle waste, and...

5
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:24,870
And they gross out girls when
you drop them down their backs.

6
00:01:25, --> 00:01:27,208
Come on, Danny. If we
want to win first prize in the

7
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,320
science fair, we've got
to be scientific about this.

8
00:01:29, --> 00:01:30,710
So, uh, what's your plan?

9
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,
We're going to prove that worms
can survive just about anything.

10
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,950
Heat, cold, stretching,
even cutting them in half.

11
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,830
Pretty harsh.

12
00:01:40, --> 00:01:42,
Are we such a baby?
Worms can't feel anything.

13
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,330
Reggie, get lost.

14
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,870
You don't own a basement.

15
00:01:47, --> 00:01:50,030
Can't you see we're on the
brink of a scientific breakthrough?

16
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,330
Well, excuse me, Dr. Wormenstein.

17
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:55,740
If you guys think your
stupid worm experiments

18
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:58,330
are going to beat our
project, you can forget it.

19
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,270
What are you going to do? Use
dolls to act out a story from the X-Files?

20
00:02:02, --> 00:02:05,890
If you must know, Beth and I
are doing the life cycle of a robin.

21
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,
We have a nest, and
eggshells, and everything.

22
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,330
Worms!

23
00:02:14, --> 00:02:15,830
Must have been something it ate.

24
00:02:16, --> 00:02:18,930
You wrecked it! I hate you!

25
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,730
I'll get you for this, Todd.
You'll be sorry.

26
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,270
Ooh, I'm so scared.

27
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,210
Ew! You're as slimy as
those worms you tortured.

28
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:33,211
All right.

29
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,760
Oh, man, when she let up that squeal,
I thought my ears were going to pop.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Worms are the best thing to use
if you want to gross someone out.

31
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:10,
I mean, you should have
heard Regina the time I

32
00:03:10, --> 00:03:12,680
put a handful of night
crawlers into the bathtub.

33
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,940
You'd hear a squeal
all the way across town.

34
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,740
Ah, sandwich. What have you got?

35
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,300
Last night's spaghetti. Want a tray?

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Sure.

37
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,060
You should see this experiment
I've got figured out for the worms.

38
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,440
It's like a racetrack, only the
different tracks have different surfaces.

39
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,340
You know, sandpaper, rocks, sticky stuff.

40
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Hey.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,760
We can call it... worms.

42
00:03:36, --> 00:03:37,
Nature survivors.

43
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,900
It tastes like something died in there.

44
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,340
Oh, gross.

45
00:03:48, --> 00:03:50,600
Is this supposed to be funny?
I didn't do it.

46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,760
Sure, that's why you wanted to swap?
You and your stupid jokes.

47
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,
Why would I? You're my best friend.

48
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,260
Not anymore.

49
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,820
Danny, I didn't do it.

50
00:03:59, --> 00:04:00,
Honest.

51
00:04:14, --> 00:04:15,650
Todd, are you in here?

52
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:26,680
No wonder I don't get in here more often.

53
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,940
It's gotten worse.

54
00:04:39, --> 00:04:41,600
Sorry, Mom. I thought you were Reggie.

55
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,
Lucky for her it was me.

56
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,
You two still at war?

57
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,360
She tried to poison me.

58
00:04:47, --> 00:04:49,340
Oh, she did not.

59
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,080
If worms were deadly,
you'd be long gone by now.

60
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:55,
Then how'd those worms get into my lunch?

61
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,880
Well, it wasn't me.

62
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,860
I like to see you getting your
protein, but that's going a bit far.

63
00:05:01, --> 00:05:02,
Very funny.

64
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:04,040
You know what's not funny?

65
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,
What you did to her robin.

66
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,880
She and Beth worked
really hard on that thing.

67
00:05:08,985 --> 00:05:10,600
It's not like I totally wrecked it.

68
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,
Not for lack of trying.

69
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,
And you're going to fix it, aren't you?

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,041
You've already put me
on trial and found me guilty.

71
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,000
You wouldn't let a judge treat
your client like that, would you?

72
00:05:20, --> 00:05:22,960
If you were my client, I'd
tell you to plead insanity.

73
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,700
Crazy about worms.

74
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,260
I just think they're cool, that's all.

75
00:05:27, --> 00:05:28,
I know.

76
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,880
But you should have some other interests.

77
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,
There's a whole big
world of really disgusting

78
00:05:35, --> 00:05:36,840
things out there just
waiting to be discovered.

79
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:39,305
Fix the bird.

80
00:05:41, --> 00:05:42,240
Or no science fair.

81
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
No way.

82
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,060
Try me.

83
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,900
The prosecution rests.

84
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,620
Now hit the sack, worm boy.

85
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,
It's after ten.

86
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,
What's going on?

87
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,290
Reggie snuck into my room
and put worms in my bed.

88
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,050
Todd, Beth is disgusting.

89
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:26,330
Don't tell me, tell Reggie.

90
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,750
She's not even here.

91
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,
She's on a sleepover at Beth's.

92
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,630
Then who?

93
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,
Todd, this whole worm thing
is completely out of control.

94
00:07:36, --> 00:07:39,370
I told you I didn't want
these worms in the house.

95
00:07:39, --> 00:07:43,790
But I... Todd, I'm not going to debate
the virtues of worms with you right now.

96
00:07:44, --> 00:07:45,950
It's nearly two a.m.

97
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,290
and I have a partner's
meeting in the morning.

98
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,090
I didn't do it.

99
00:07:52, --> 00:07:53,
Honest.


00:07:54, --> 00:07:57,310
Clean up the worms and go back to bed now.


00:08:34, --> 00:08:35,850
Do you want a sleepover tonight?


00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,850
We could watch videos.


00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,
No, thanks.


00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
We could order pizza.


00:08:41, --> 00:08:42,710
Double cheese, pineapple, pepperoni.


00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,370
And worms.


00:08:44, --> 00:08:46,230
I didn't do it. Why would I?


00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,
I'm your best friend, remember?


00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,790
Did Reggie confess?


00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,730
No, she's got Mom totally snowed.


00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,010
Last night she even came into
my room and put worms in my bed.


00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,770
Really? Gross.


00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,
She may think she's
getting away with something,


00:08:58, --> 00:09:00,306
but I'll make sure she's the
one who's going to squirm.


00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,090
What are you going to do?


00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,750
Let's just say I'll need more worms.


00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,370
Zillions of them.


00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,850
I like the sound of it so far.


00:09:06, --> 00:09:08,650
Tonight I'm going down
the lake to dig for fresh ones.


00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,210
Coming?


00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,
Nah, Mom wants me to shampoo the dog.


00:09:12, --> 00:09:14,310
But I'll ask her about
sleeping over tonight.


00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,810
See ya.


00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,830
So, did you get your dad
to print out our robin report?


00:09:21, --> 00:09:23,
He said he could do it when
he gets home from work.


00:09:23, --> 00:09:24,
Todd fixed the robin yet?


00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,446
Maybe your dad could have a look at it.


00:09:26, --> 00:09:27,
I can bring it over later.


00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
What do you want?


00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,
For starters, you can tell Mom the truth.


00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,730
Look, I told you.


00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,070
I wouldn't even touch
one of your stupid worms.


00:09:37, --> 00:09:39,080
Why would I put one in your spaghetti?


00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,
Ugh, my brother and his worms.


00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,350
I think I'm going to be sick.


00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,
And I suppose you don't know anything about
those worms in my bed last night either.


00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,890
I'm definitely going to be sick.


00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,970
And if you think you got
away with it, you didn't.


00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,
You're going to be very sorry.


00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,
Not as sorry as you are when me
and Beth cream you at the science fair.


00:09:57, --> 00:10:00,670
Oh yeah? My worms will
toast your stupid robin any day.


00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:02,030
You've got worms on the brain.


00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,350
Just ignore him, Beth.


00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,670
Well, I always do.


00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,
Worms on the brain?


00:10:07, --> 00:10:08,990
Worms on the brain!


00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,
Worms on the brain!


00:10:11, --> 00:10:13,090
Worms on the brain!


00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,030
Worms on the brain!


00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,990
Worms on the brain.


00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:18,930
Worms on the brain.


00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,790
We're all Persians.


00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,297
Great! A little rain will
bring it to the surface.


00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:06,600
Maybe I'll catch some
necrons. Nice, juicy ones.


00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,370
Ah! Someone!


00:12:14,371 --> 00:13:06,735
What is this place?
Hello? Anybody here?


00:13:06,747 --> 00:14:06,980
Where the heck am I?
How do I get out of here?


00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,
Todd, we will make you squirm.


00:14:54, --> 00:15:19,860
Help! Someone!


00:16:25, --> 00:16:29,277
The giant worm! It
grabbed me. Did you see


00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:33,290
it? Giant worm? It's
gone. It didn't get me.


00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,915
What's he babbling about?
No giant worm. I could


00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:40,270
kiss you. Don't you dare.
Todd, what are you up to?


00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,
Nothing. I'm telling
you, there's a giant


00:16:42, --> 00:16:44,
worm down there and
that bird scared it away.


00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,428
Stay away from my robin.
Come on, Beth. I can't believe


00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,910
he'd wreck his clothes
just to play that dumb trick.


00:16:52, --> 00:16:54,090
What can I tell you? He's nuts.


00:16:55, --> 00:17:01,750
Worms on the brain.
Worms on the brain. Worms on the brain.


00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,260
This house is now officially worm free.


00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,
Looks like you've done some redecorating.
I guess.


00:18:22, --> 00:18:25,240
How's it coming? Almost finished.


00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:30,
We're going to watch a video.
You're in charge of popcorn.


00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,980
Sure. I'll be right down.


00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,
Are you sure about this? Totally.


00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,960
You give up worms? That's like
me giving up double cheese nachos.


00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,062
So maybe I'm bored
with them. Ever think of


00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:13,
that? Well, at least let
me save some for bait.


00:19:13, --> 00:19:14,
We don't need any worms.


00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,
These minnows make great bait.


00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,
Whoa, that one got away.


00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,
Don't grip so hard.
Bring him down and push him through.


00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,700
Don't worry. It's a stupid little minnow.
They don't feel a thing.


00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,
So now what are you supposed
to do for the science fair?


00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,280
I don't care.
So long as it has nothing to do with worms.


00:19:43, --> 00:19:45,
How about we do something with fish?


00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,
Not a bad idea. When you think about it,
fish really are nature's perfect creatures.


00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,300
That's what you said about worms.


00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,
I know, but fish are way better.


00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,
They can live for millions of years.
I mean, they can breathe underwater.


00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,691
Survive under polar ice
caps or in tropical heat.


00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:03,720
I mean, they probably
don't even have to sleep.


00:20:04, --> 00:20:06,
How are we supposed to make
a science project out of fish?


00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,700
All we need is a few experiments. How long
can fish live in hot water or cold water?


00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,280
How long can a freshwater fish
survive in salt water? Stuff like that.


00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,440
Isn't that kind of cruel?
I mean, like, making them suffer like that?


00:20:17, --> 00:20:20,
Don't be such a baby.
We've got to be scientific about this.


00:20:20, --> 00:20:22,220
I'm telling you, fish can't feel anything.


00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,260
All right, I got one!


00:20:26, --> 00:20:27,960
Yeah, easy, easy.


00:20:28, --> 00:20:30,
Ah, nuts. Got away.


00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,980
Took my bait, too.


00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,740
I hope I catch one.
I can't wait to start my experiment.


00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,
So, uh, what are we going
to call this fish experiment?


00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,920
Fish. Nature's survivors.


00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,880
I'm going to have a bite
of your sandwich, okay?


00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:45,300
My sandwich?
I thought it was your sandwich.

208
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Oh!

209
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
John!

210
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,
Danny, help! They've got me! I'm marked!

211
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,780
Hey, guys, come on.

212
00:20:59, --> 00:21:01,680
Hey, I was just kidding.
I'll keep on fishing, I promise.

213
00:21:02, --> 00:21:03,920
I'm too small. You've got to throw me back.

214
00:21:04, --> 00:21:07,020
You guys look like nice fish.
Please let me go.

215
00:21:08, --> 00:21:09,
Oh, thanks.

216
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,800
What?

217
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:13,
You're going to make me swim back?

1
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,410
Welcome back to another video!

2
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:35,630
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

3
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:35,670
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

4
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:38,231
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

5
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,970
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

6
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:55,
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

7
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,270
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

8
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:56,650
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

9
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,370
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

10
00:01:14, --> 00:01:16,710
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

11
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,870
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

12
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,280
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

13
00:02:43, --> 00:02:45,280
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

14
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:45,660
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

15
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:45,900
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

16
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:48,
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

17
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,436
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

18
00:02:59, --> 00:03:01,
Today, we're going to be doing
something a little bit different.

19
00:03:01, --> 00:03:05,
Yes, my grandfather told me
this story when I was really little.

20
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,740
See, in my research, I found that
every town has scary stories and legends.

21
00:03:10, --> 00:03:12,600
In my research? Little Miss Perfect.

22
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,720
Eddie, do you have something
you'd like to say to the class?

23
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,420
Uh, no.

24
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
Then please be quiet.

25
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,800
Why do you think people
come up with stories like that?

26
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,860
People have a need to create monsters.

27
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,
It helps us believe that the real world
isn't as scary as the monsters we dream up.

28
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,940
She talks like a book.

29
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:32,360
But of course, monsters
only exist in our imagination.

30
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,420
That's not necessarily true.

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,685
There are scientists
that believe Bigfoot

32
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:38,600
really exists, and the
Loch Ness Monster, too.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,820
But do you have proof that monsters exist?

34
00:03:41, --> 00:03:43,240
Yeah, you're looking at one.
His name's Courtney.

35
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,940
Proof? Of course not, Miss Prince.

36
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,
See, if I had proof, we wouldn't
be having this little discussion.

37
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,016
You've got a point there, Courtney.

38
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
I know.

39
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,
A snake? Don't be such a chicken.

40
00:03:58, --> 00:03:59,
It's for her.

41
00:04:00, --> 00:04:02,260
A snake for a snake. Exactly.

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,
That's very thorough, Courtney.

43
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,860
I know. Thank you.

44
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,900
That's so excellent.

45
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,
You're right about that, Eddie.

46
00:04:11, --> 00:04:13,
That was an excellent report, Courtney.

47
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,711
And we're looking forward to hearing yours.

48
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,
If you can ever get it
out of your computer.

49
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,360
But it really is stuck in there.

50
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,000
If you want to download it to a
disk, I'm sure I can help you print it.

51
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,431
Maybe Courtney can help you, Eddie.

52
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,820
I can't wait until lunchtime.

53
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,220
This is going to be good.

54
00:04:38, --> 00:04:39,740
Shh. She'll know something's up.

55
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,080
Mr. Finley, how are you?

56
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:42,960
Very well, thank you for asking.

57
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,940
And your family?

58
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,260
How nice of you to ask. They're fine.

59
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
What a kiss-up.

60
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,
Well, you have a nice day, Courtney.

61
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
You too, Mr. Finley.

62
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
You're not eating?

63
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,
No, I left my lunch at home today.

64
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,380
I don't really get to lunch.

65
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,
Then please, have a little of mine.

66
00:05:01, --> 00:05:03,020
Oh, no. No, I couldn't.

67
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,640
Please, I insist.

68
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,981
My mom, she always packs too much, anyway.

69
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,
Well, thank you very much, Courtney.

70
00:05:11, --> 00:05:12,440
She's giving it to Finley.

71
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,840
Great, we'll get both of them.

72
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,000
And maybe if we're lucky, Mr. Finley
will think Courtney did it on purpose.

73
00:05:21, --> 00:05:22,
Yes?

74
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,660
I can't.

75
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,
No.

76
00:05:27, --> 00:05:28,
No.

77
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,340
But it's smoked salmon with cream cheese.

78
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,620
Smoked salmon?

79
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,920
Oh, I can't say no to that.

80
00:05:49, --> 00:05:50,
Courtney, get it off me!

81
00:05:51, --> 00:05:51,
It's okay, it's okay.

82
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,
It's just a corn snake.

83
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,330
I'm sorry, Mr. Finley.

84
00:05:57,331 --> 00:05:58,770
I had no idea.

85
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,
Someone must have put it in my bag.

86
00:06:05, --> 00:06:07,230
Hey, just take that away from me.

87
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,010
Please.

88
00:06:08, --> 00:06:09,
It's harmless, really.

89
00:06:10, --> 00:06:12,250
You're not scared?

90
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,010
No, I love all creatures.

91
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,210
Would you like to touch it?

92
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,
Well, I don't, you
know, I don't... No.

93
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,610
I understand your reluctance, Mr. Finley.

94
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,270
Most people are afraid of snakes.

95
00:06:25, --> 00:06:26,210
Great idea, Hat.

96
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,390
You're getting all tied
up there, aren't you?

97
00:06:49, --> 00:07:01,
Oh, this one's a beauty.

98
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,310
No thanks.

99
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,430
That's the thing about
computers these days.


00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,850
Anyone can figure them out.


00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,610
Oh, sorry.


00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,
I didn't see you.


00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,930
I'm very sorry.


00:07:13, --> 00:07:14,
What's your ID?


00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,
No way, I ain't doing it.


00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,
Chicken.


00:07:38, --> 00:07:39,660
I know you are, but when am I?


00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,996
That's so funny, I forgot to laugh.


00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,
You get it.


00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,660
No way.


00:07:43, --> 00:07:44,721
Are you scared of everything?


00:07:45, --> 00:07:46,
No.


00:07:46, --> 00:07:47,
Then prove it.


00:07:50, --> 00:07:51,626
Okay, you got something to put it in?


00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,
I don't want to do it.


00:08:03, --> 00:08:05,
Come on, man, it's just a bug.


00:08:05, --> 00:08:06,
It's a bug.


00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,270
I'm trying.


00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:34,
Courtney, you know you
don't need to do any extra work.


00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,250
You've already got an A+.


00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,
Yeah, but I was hoping I
could get something higher.


00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,220
There is no such thing.


00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,690
You sure? We're in science class.


00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,870
We can invent one.


00:08:43, --> 00:08:44,
I hate her.


00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,090
Courtney, I wish there
were more students like you.


00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,
And I wish there were
more teachers like you.


00:09:04, --> 00:09:05,
Quit tickling my leg.


00:09:05, --> 00:09:06,
Shh, I'm not.


00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,990
You're not.


00:09:12, --> 00:09:13,
You're not.


00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,250
It's okay, it's okay.


00:09:24, --> 00:09:25,270
Would you like a ride home?


00:09:26, --> 00:09:27,750
No, it's okay, I like to walk.


00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:29,790
It gives me time to
think about my classwork.


00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,720
Don't forget to shut the door
behind you when you're through.


00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,850
Oh my God.


00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,990
It's okay, it's okay.


00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,330
Don't get hurt, it scares them.


00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,590
Help!


00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,210
Help!


00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,250
Help!


00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,430
Don't move.


00:10:00, --> 00:10:01,
Hello.


00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:04,320
It's okay, tarantula, it's okay.


00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,
Tarantulas hardly ever bite.


00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,280
And even if they do, it doesn't hurt.


00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,660
Like the snake.


00:10:11, --> 00:10:12,600
It's a misunderstood creature.


00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,
Would you like to touch it?


00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,040
No, it's okay.


00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
We'll take a rain check.


00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Okay.


00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,
Here's today's Muddy Creek Observer.


00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,980
The legend of the mud monsters
was written by Courtney King.


00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,020
Courtney again?


00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,820
I think we should all give Courtney a hand.


00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,910
It's not every day we have
a famous writer in our midst.


00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,750
Well, I'm not exactly famous yet.


00:10:56, --> 00:10:57,
Well, you're published.


00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,330
That's the first step.


00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,010
Spare me.


00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,230
Eddie.


00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,870
As a published author, what
would you say the value of writing is?


00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,850
Well, when I was a child, I used
to be afraid of mud monsters.


00:11:11, --> 00:11:13,944
But as I started to do
my research, I realized


00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,970
that there was
nothing to be afraid of.


00:11:16, --> 00:11:18,055
I was basically afraid of the unknown.


00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,390
So I should say thank you, Miss Prince.


00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,710
Thank me? Why?


00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,
I guess writing this report
helped me confront my fears.


00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,050
And now I'm not scared of anything.


00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,930
Very good.


00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,930
Now I know how we can get Courtney.


00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,790
Look, all I'm saying is, if
you're not scared, prove it.


00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,430
How?


00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:46,
Meet Eddie and me at Muddy Creek.
After school, we dare you. Right, Eddie?


00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,790
Yeah.


00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,
You two don't ever give up, do you?


00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,230
See, I told you she was
afraid of mud monsters.


00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,830
No. I'll be there. I promise.


00:12:00, --> 00:12:01,
BELL RINGS.


00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,
Why do I have to be the mud monster?


00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,770
Because it was my idea.


00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,390
So how do I look?


00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,
Like, like someone covered in mud.


00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,090
I think she believes in them.


00:12:25, --> 00:12:27,
You know, deep down,
she will after tonight.


00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,750
It'll just hold still.


00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,740
That's better.


00:12:39, --> 00:12:40,
Hmm.


00:12:46, --> 00:12:47,
Whoa!


00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,030
Oh, man!


00:13:03, --> 00:13:04,
Eddie?


00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,250
You better hide.
She's going to be here any sec.


00:13:08, --> 00:13:10,387
Okay, when she shows up,
I'll bring her here and you jump


00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,860
out and tell her you're going
to turn her into a mud monster.


00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,940
I can't wait to see it.
Big, brave Courtney begging for her life.


00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Um...


00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,600
And, uh, put some more mud on, okay?


00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
Courtney!


00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,090
Courtney!


00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,
Courtney, where are you?


00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:05,930
Eddie!


00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,
I told you to stay where you were!


00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,220
Hey, Courtney!


00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,300
Courtney!

208
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,
SCREAMS.

209
00:16:01, --> 00:16:02,
MUSIC.

210
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,
Pat, it's just me, Eddie.

211
00:16:15, --> 00:16:17,940
Eddie, listen to me, there's
a real mud monster out there.

212
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,660
There's no such thing.

213
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,800
I'm not kidding! We gotta move!

214
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,
Look, there's no such thing.

215
00:16:24, --> 00:16:26,
Think about it. Monsters aren't real.

216
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,440
I saw Eddie.

217
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,020
Just imagine it. It was probably just
the fog of the swamp or something.

218
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,780
I'm scared.

219
00:16:42, --> 00:16:45,
Isn't it interesting how
people keep on trying

220
00:16:45, --> 00:16:48,260
something that has no
chance of succeeding?

221
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,750
Here we have two adolescents
of average or below intelligence,

222
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:57,360
trying to outwit an adolescent of
much higher than average intelligence.

223
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,
I'm not bragging, I'm
just stating the facts.

224
00:17:01, --> 00:17:05,
But what is really interesting is your
persistence, what keeps you going.

225
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,360
It reminds me of some lab rats I
once saw in some science experiment.

226
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,420
Lab rats?

227
00:17:11, --> 00:17:13,688
They keep on shocking
the poor little things, but

228
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,900
they keep on insisting
to have their food pellet.

229
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,000
Can you believe them?

230
00:17:17, --> 00:17:18,801
Kind of pathetic when you think about it.

231
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,060
Mud!

232
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,260
Mud!

233
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
A monster!

234
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh! A mud monster!

235
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,700
A mud monster is behind me, I see.

236
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
You are right.

237
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,840
Don't interrupt. I can feel your anger.

238
00:17:48, --> 00:17:48,740
But why?

239
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,260
That's what we need to look at.

240
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,980
Now, isn't that better?

241
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,700
Now, we have to talk about
your aggressive behavior.

242
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,700
You can't expect sympathy from people
if you're always attacking them, you know.

243
00:18:06, --> 00:18:09,
Well-adjusted monsters just
don't do those sorts of things.

244
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,260
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
inside this monster we all see,

245
00:18:14, --> 00:18:17,020
I think we have an
emotionally wounded creature.

246
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,
It wasn't until I admitted to
myself that there was nothing wrong

247
00:18:22, --> 00:18:25,280
with being perfect that I was
able to totally accept myself.

248
00:18:25, --> 00:18:28,250
You need to work on your
self-growth and definitely

249
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:30,
do something about
your impulsive behavior.

250
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,640
Hear me out.

251
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,
Hello there. Hello?

252
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,060
Are you even listening to me?

253
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,000
Courtney, when did you first realize
you were dealing with a monster?

254
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,
As I told the president earlier,
when he phoned to congratulate me,

255
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,820
I always suspected that there might be some
truth to the legend of the mud monster.

256
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,740
I think I'm going to be sick.

257
00:19:00, --> 00:19:02,
Only Courtney could talk
a mud monster to death.

258
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,
I also told him that being a hero
comes with lots of responsibility.

259
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,340
That's why saving the lives
of two frightened little boys,

260
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,
Pat and Eddie, were something I had to do.

261
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,
Oh, brother.

262
00:19:16, --> 00:19:19,700
I'll never forget the look of
absolute terror in their little faces.

263
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,040
Oh, darn the rain.

264
00:19:28, --> 00:19:30,
Shall we reconvene at City Hall?

265
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,
Some monster.

266
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,
Yeah, just a big dirt clot.

267
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,
I really don't get it.

268
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Let's just admit it.

269
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,000
We'll never beat Courtney.

270
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Yeah.

271
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,
Shouldn't we get out of the rain?

272
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
What for?

273
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,620
Yeah.

274
00:20:35, --> 00:20:36,
I've just got to tell you, Eddie.

275
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,780
Life just isn't fair.

276
00:20:39, --> 00:20:40,680
Oh, thanks, man.

1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:38,250
Welcome to our channel.

2
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,690
Goosebumps.

3
00:00:50, --> 00:00:52,250
You better beware.

4
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,950
You're in for a scare.

5
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:14,320
Come on, Mindy.
Stop throwing it like a wimp.

6
00:01:18, --> 00:01:20,
Cut it out, Joe. Quit throwing it so hard.

7
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Come on, throw it right.

8
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,820
Here, how's this?

9
00:01:25, --> 00:01:30,350
Joe, now you can go and get it.

10
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,590
I'm not going in there.

11
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,370
What if he comes out?

12
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,330
I'm sick of losing all our stuff.

13
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,850
You're crazy, Joe.

14
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,300
Now it's mine.

15
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:09,301
Mine.

16
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,900
And you stay out of my garden.

17
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,
Hey, kids, look what I found.

18
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,780
More lawn ornaments, Dad?

19
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,280
Yeah, lawn gnomes.

20
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,340
I went by Lawn Lovely this morning.

21
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,600
They were just sitting there.

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,
I got them for practically nothing.

23
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,
Hey, Dad, that maniac
just took my baseball.

24
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,740
He just took it.

25
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,
Oh, well, was it in his yard?

26
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:51,020
Well, yeah, but... Well, Joe,
what do you want me to do?

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,240
Go over there and start a war?

28
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,836
Come on, let's take a
look at these little guys.

29
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,860
All right.

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,
Whoa, man, these things are weird-looking.

31
00:03:11, --> 00:03:14,070
Oh, wow, real scary.

32
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,250
Come on, Joe, stop forcing around, huh?

33
00:03:19, --> 00:03:21,950
So, are these things terrific or what?

34
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,630
I don't know.

35
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,210
They're kind of evil-looking.

36
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,
Evil?

37
00:03:26, --> 00:03:27,590
I think they're cute.

38
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,210
Yeah, I think so, too.

39
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,
And with these guys in the backyard,

40
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,810
we are a cinch to win the
summer garden contest.

41
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,210
Am I right?

42
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,
Yeah, and at Christmas we
can dress them up as elves.

43
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,890
Santa's elves?

44
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,990
Dracula's elves, maybe.

45
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,726
So, what do you think, kids?

46
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,050
Here? Huh?

47
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,830
Hey, Burton.

48
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,
You didn't tell me your
relatives were coming to visit.

49
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,750
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

50
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,
If the Major wants to
be a jerk, just let him.

51
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,270
I was pretty sure I'd win the garden
contest this summer, but now I'm positive.

52
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,870
These are the most
ridiculous-looking things I've ever seen.

53
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,
They're a disgrace to
the whole neighborhood.

54
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,710
When are you going to wise
up and get rid of all this junk?

55
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,600
It's our garden.

56
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,400
Yeah, not everyone wants
their flowers to stand at attention.

57
00:04:32, --> 00:04:33,
Kids, come on.

58
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,840
The Major is entitled to his opinion.

59
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,
I don't need your permission.

60
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,740
The contest judges will
tell you which garden is best.

61
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,940
Well, I'll take my chances.

62
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,420
When they see my impeccable flower beds,

63
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,960
my immaculate lawn, my flawless melons,

64
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,
that summer garden award is
marching straight home to me.

65
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,240
We'll see about that.

66
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,780
What was that, Joe?

67
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,
Nothing, sir.
You may go back to your petunias, sir.

68
00:05:02, --> 00:05:03,
Joe.

69
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,
That's okay, Burton.

70
00:05:04, --> 00:05:08,680
I just hope Joe here isn't planning
to do anything to my garden.

71
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,
A sneak attack, maybe.

72
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,400
At night, maybe.

73
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
What?

74
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,
You're way off base there, McCall.

75
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,600
Joe has been brought up to
respect other people's property.

76
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,761
Is that why he comes tramping
through my rose bushes?

77
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,
Let me say this loud and clear.

78
00:05:25, --> 00:05:27,700
If anything happens to my garden,

79
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,340
I'll be looking for him.

80
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Oh.

81
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
Ruined.

82
00:06:32, --> 00:06:33,360
They're totally ruined.

83
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Take it easy, Major.

84
00:06:35, --> 00:06:35,620
Take it easy?

85
00:06:36, --> 00:06:37,
Look at this!

86
00:06:38, --> 00:06:39,
Oh, boy.

87
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,
I warned him.

88
00:06:42, --> 00:06:43,
What's up?

89
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,760
Well, Joe, apparently somebody
smashed the Major's melons last night.

90
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,960
I came out to water my
columbines before sunup,

91
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
and look what I found.

92
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,060
Maybe it was raccoons.

93
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,880
Oh, nice try.

94
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,600
Now, raccoons are smart,

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,780
but they don't throw things against walls,

96
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,040
and I never saw one who could do this.

97
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Whoa.

98
00:07:05, --> 00:07:07,820
I warned you to stay out of my garden.

99
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,600
But I didn't go in the garden.


00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,
Burton, it's going to take more than
30 tricks for you to win this contest.


00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,400
I didn't do it, Dad.


00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
Honest.


00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,940
Okay, Joe.


00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,380
Try not to let the Major get to you, okay?


00:07:30, --> 00:07:31,660
And, uh...


00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,291
Try to stay out of his way.


00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Okay?


00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
Attaboy.


00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Please?


00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,350
Oh, there's my juvenile delinquent brother.


00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,970
I'm telling you, Mindy,
I didn't do anything.


00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,250
Yeah, right.


00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,050
Want to play ring toss?


00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,410
The gnome's pointy heads
will make perfect targets.


00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,910
How about your pointy head?


00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,670
You are so immature.


00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,690
Perfect.


00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,650
I'm telling you, Mindy, I
didn't smash his stupid melons.


00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:10,651
Then who did?


00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,410
I don't know, but if I
did, I'd shake his hand.


00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,850
Nice one.


00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,370
Is that what your father calls punishment?


00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,
Playing games with
those ugly pieces of junk?


00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,350
Take it easy, Joe.


00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,210
You just try coming in my yard again.


00:08:27, --> 00:08:29,250
I'll be waiting next time, son.


00:08:29, --> 00:08:30,930
Yes, sir, you can bet that.


00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,670
I know he's a jerk, but you better
listen to Dad and stay out of his way.


00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,930
Black ink?


00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,370
Melon seeds?


00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:07,
My garden.


00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,080
What have you done?


00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,880
But I didn't, sir.
It was the gnomes. It was...


00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,890
My lilies.


00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,630
My azaleas.


00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,710
My eagle.


00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,
I didn't do anything, sir.
It was the gnomes. They...


00:11:37, --> 00:11:41,090
What kind of fool do you take me for?
You're gonna pay for this.


00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,
What are these things doing in my yard?


00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,670
What is going on over there?


00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,350
Dad!


00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,390
Joe, what are you doing here?


00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,650
See for yourself.
He's been destroying my garden.


00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,
You can't be serious.


00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,010
You can't deny it this time.
I caught him red-handed.


00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,090
Joe?


00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,
I didn't do it, Dad. Honest.


00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,810
It was the gnomes.


00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,830
Stop right there.


00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,711
No, really. I heard the noise, and I came
out, and they were... He's a liar, too.


00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,350
I know it's hard to believe.


00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,
You are gonna fix Major McCall's garden.


00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,410
But, Dad... Until it is perfect.


00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,750
Do you understand?


00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,090
Now, get back in the house.


00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,690
I'm very sorry, Major.


00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
I'll just get my gnomes.


00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,780
Move it, soldier!


00:12:59, --> 00:13:01,
You're gonna replant this
entire garden by the weekend.


00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,420
All right? Over to the Pentagon.


00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,620
Sir.


00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,700
Nice, straight lines.


00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,
Reminds me of the time... Forget it.


00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,340
Got it? Good.


00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,920
Okay, that's enough of a break.


00:13:15, --> 00:13:16,720
Paul, let's move over to the corner bed.


00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
On the double!


00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,070
Something doesn't smell so good.


00:13:28, --> 00:13:30,390
I'm too tired to smell it anymore.


00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,
You deserve it for making up
that lame story about the gnomes.


00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,070
I didn't make it up. It's true.


00:13:36, --> 00:13:36,910
Maybe.


00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:40,690
See? If you ask nicely, the gnomes
will finish your yard work for you.


00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,370
And then you can kick back with me.


00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,930
After you take a bath for about a year.


00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,290
You laugh, but I'll prove it to you.


00:13:48, --> 00:13:49,750
I won't hold my breath.


00:13:59, --> 00:14:10,830
Great, no tape.


00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,380
It's a sour.


00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,
They're not calling. They're missing.


00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,300
They're not going fishing. No way.


00:14:40, --> 00:14:41,
What's missing?


00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,620
Nothing's missing.
Go back to sleep. It's just a dream.


00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,
No, it isn't. I can show you.


00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What do you know?


00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,400
I know when something is a
dream, they'll go back to sleep.


00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:51,800
Big day tomorrow. Big day.


00:14:53, --> 00:14:54,
Mindy, Mindy, wake up!


00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,900
What are you doing in my room?


00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,380
Come on, the gnomes are gone.
You have to come.


00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,080
You're gonna owe me big time.


00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,880
What did you do to them?


00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,
I didn't do anything. They come to life.


00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,720
Yeah, right. I forgot. They come to life.


00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,820
And then what did they do?


00:15:11, --> 00:15:12,
You'll see.


00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,820
Who's that?


00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,900
I don't know.


00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,260
I think it came from the back.


00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Turn that off.


00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,000
Maybe we should go back.


00:15:29, --> 00:15:30,
No, no. Come on.


00:15:42, --> 00:15:44,220
It went off!


00:16:03, --> 00:16:07,
Enjoy your drink.


00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,860
Are you okay?


00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:11,620
So far.


00:16:12, --> 00:16:15,040
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

208
00:16:16, --> 00:16:17,240
Give me that.

209
00:16:28, --> 00:16:30,320
What do they want?

210
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,400
Squish them like bugs.

211
00:16:39, --> 00:16:42,860
That's stupid.
Let's squish them like pretzels.

212
00:16:43, --> 00:16:43,
No.

213
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,
Put a spell on them.

214
00:16:45, --> 00:16:46,920
A magic spell.

215
00:16:47, --> 00:16:48,
No.

216
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,060
Squish them.

217
00:16:52, --> 00:16:55,060
I know. We can squish them like bugs.

218
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,240
That's what I said.

219
00:16:57,241 --> 00:16:59,
Why are you doing this?

220
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,640
Don't you know anything about gnomes?

221
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,380
It's what we do.

222
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,240
It's in our nature.

223
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,920
We make mischief.

224
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,020
Anywhere, anytime, and to anyone.

225
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,
Like you.

226
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,860
Like you.

227
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,
That's it.

228
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,400
The light freezes them.

229
00:17:32, --> 00:17:34,660
The light! Get the light!

230
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,960
Hold it right there or I'll turn
you into Mount Rushmore.

231
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,
We're free. The light freezes them.

232
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,
There are non-gnomes by day.

233
00:17:51, --> 00:17:53,920
But in the dark, they're just plain gnomes.

234
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:54,921
Not plain.

235
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,980
Me lots.

236
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,
Come on.

237
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
They're going to get us.

238
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,620
Oh, no.

239
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,860
What are we going to do?

240
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:23,
What are you going to do, poor guy?

241
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Get ready.

242
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,620
You'll never make it.

243
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,980
Get them.

244
00:18:29, --> 00:18:30,
Mindy, run.

245
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,380
Come on.

246
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Are you okay?

247
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,240
Let's get out of here.

248
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,
Don't you kids run away from me.

249
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:05,920
I've had it with this junk.

250
00:19:06, --> 00:19:08,340
I'm going to get rid
of it once and for all.

251
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:11,440
Starting with you.

252
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,240
What are we looking at over here?

253
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Oh, oh.

254
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,660
Oh, no.

255
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,390
I don't think I've ever seen one of those.

256
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
What is that?

257
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,010
It was a most difficult decision, Mr. Burt.

258
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,
We love your inventiveness.

259
00:20:05, --> 00:20:09,
The way you mix the natural
world with whimsy and fantasy.

260
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,850
We've never seen another garden like it.

261
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,330
Oh, well, thank you very much.

262
00:20:14, --> 00:20:15,810
I knew you could do it, dear.

263
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,750
Well, I'd just like to say that I'm deeply
honored to accept the grand prize.

264
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,
Well, I'm sure you would be if you had won.

265
00:20:24, --> 00:20:28,
But I thought you... Oh, we were about
to give you the grand prize, all right.

266
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,
But then we saw...

267
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,
Well, it was so, so jarring.

268
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,250
So out of place.

269
00:20:35, --> 00:20:37,
So, so ugly.

270
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,870
Frankly, we were shocked.

271
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,030
Are you talking about the lawn gnomes?

272
00:20:42, --> 00:20:44,890
Oh, no, we loved the lawn gnomes.

273
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:46,330
Cute little fellows.

274
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,910
Adorable.

275
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,
Well, then what are you talking about?

276
00:20:53, --> 00:20:56,030
That hideous lawn ornament.

277
00:20:56, --> 00:20:57,
That.

1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:17,920
FUNKY MUSIC BEAT ENDS
FUNKY MUSIC CARS ZOOMING.

2
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,720
FUNKY MUSIC DOG BARKING.

3
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,860
FUNKY MUSIC.

4
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:54,980
GHOSTBOUNCE FUNKY MUSIC
You will beware, you're in for a scare.

5
00:01:05, --> 00:01:06,
Terry!

6
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,730
Where'd you go, Terry?

7
00:01:12, --> 00:01:13,
Terry?

8
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,070
Terry!

9
00:01:22, --> 00:01:23,960
Oh man, you and your dumb hobbies.

10
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,
Wax rubbers. Who makes wax rubbers?

11
00:01:26, --> 00:01:29,060
I do, because I'm interested in things.

12
00:01:29, --> 00:01:30,720
Let's go down to the beach.

13
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,420
We finally get to visit Brad and Agatha,

14
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:35,895
and all you want to do is
rub gravestones all day.

15
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,680
It's cool. See, Jerry?

16
00:01:38, --> 00:01:40,660
It's a death's head, an old Puritan symbol.

17
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,
Creepy, huh?

18
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,340
Right. Let's go to the beach.

19
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,620
Hey, check out the name.

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Harrison Sadler.

21
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,060
Sadler?

22
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,440
I know, look.

23
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,680
He died in 2.

24
00:01:52, --> 00:01:53,800
One of the first guys to come to America,

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,
and he's got our last name.

26
00:01:55, --> 00:01:56,
Oh.

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,020
Check out the epitaph.

28
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,
Though his bones are but dust,

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,760
his spirit lives on forever.

30
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,040
Terry, don't you want to go to the beach?

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,600
I love it that everything
around here is so old.

32
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,240
Best one ever!

33
00:02:30, --> 00:02:32,996
You've got to be pretty demented
if you think that was funny.

34
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,220
We've been watching you guys.

35
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:35,640
We could see you this morning,

36
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,220
heading out for the graveyard,

37
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,600
so we thought we'd give you a little scare.

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Little scare?

39
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,370
Come on, Terry, let's go.

40
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,920
Hey, we're sorry.

41
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,820
We are. We're really sorry.

42
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,060
It was just a joke.

43
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,660
A pretty complicated joke.

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
I guess it was.

45
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,980
My name's Sam Sadler.

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
This is my sister Louisa.

47
00:02:52, --> 00:02:54,020
Sadler? That's our last name.

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,800
Really?

49
00:02:55, --> 00:02:57,876
Yeah. I'm Terry Sadler,
and this is my brother, Jerry.

50
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,000
We're staying with Brad and Agatha,
our fourth cousins, twice remodeled.

51
00:03:01, --> 00:03:03,680
Removed, Jerry. Twice removed.

52
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,260
Whatever that means.

53
00:03:05, --> 00:03:07,
It means they're distant relatives.

54
00:03:07, --> 00:03:08,
They're Sadlers, too.

55
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,220
There's lots of Sadlers around here.

56
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,960
No kidding. Even dead ones.

57
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,600
Harrison Sadler is dead,

58
00:03:15, --> 00:03:17,
but he still walks the night.

59
00:03:18, --> 00:03:20,040
They're just trying to scare us again.

60
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,660
Nice try.

61
00:03:23, --> 00:03:24,
Oh, come on.

62
00:03:24, --> 00:03:27,
You don't really believe in ghosts, do you?

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,220
If you go near the cave down at the beach,

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,420
you will, too.

65
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:31,421
That's enough, Sam.

66
00:03:31, --> 00:03:31,900
The cave?

67
00:03:32, --> 00:03:33,040
Come on. We need to go.

68
00:03:33, --> 00:03:34,
We'll see you around.

69
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,300
Agatha, give Jerry a little more of that.

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,660
Oh, I sure will, Brad.

71
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,040
Everything tastes so much better
cooked on that old wood burner.

72
00:03:51, --> 00:03:52,
They brought in the power,

73
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,620
but we haven't bothered hooking it up.

74
00:03:55, --> 00:03:57,300
Um, I don't think I could eat all this.

75
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,340
Really?

76
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,
Well, your parents didn't
say you were such little eaters.

77
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
Oh, but it's good.

78
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,300
It's really good.

79
00:04:05, --> 00:04:10,980
Oh, it's so nice having young folk around
the place that appreciate our way of life.

80
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,
It's so nice your folks brought you
up here to be with your own cousins.

81
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:18,
Sure is better than spending the
summer in a sweaty apartment.

82
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,301
A dad told us all kinds of stories
about being here when he was a kid.

83
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,691
We always wanted to
meet you guys in person.

84
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,
Well, your dad always
cared about keeping

85
00:04:28, --> 00:04:29,
the family together,
always made the effort.

86
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,400
We met some other Saddlers today.

87
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Kids.

88
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
A Sam and Louisa.

89
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,060
Mm-hmm.

90
00:04:38, --> 00:04:39,
Nice kids.

91
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,
Are they our relatives, too?

92
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Could be.

93
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,620
Very, very distant, if they are.

94
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,060
They went on about some ghost in a cave.

95
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,
I never heard of it.

96
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,220
Well, I've got some reading to do.

97
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:58,380
Oh, I'll help.

98
00:05:27, --> 00:05:29,080
Some kinds of seaweed you can actually eat.

99
00:05:29, --> 00:05:30,
It's full of iodine.


00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
It's full of bugs.


00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,260
Let's go see if we can find that cave.


00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,800
There are no bugs in it.


00:05:35, --> 00:05:37,820
I wish I had a book on all
the different types of seaweed.


00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,640
Fine, I'll look for the cave myself then.


00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
What's wrong?


00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,980
A perfect skeleton.


00:05:56, --> 00:05:56,720
Of what?


00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:58,340
A raccoon, maybe.


00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,260
Too small for a raccoon.


00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,760
Do you guys always keep up on everyone?


00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,680
Sorry.


00:06:04, --> 00:06:06,
Well, if it's not a
raccoon, then what is it?


00:06:06, --> 00:06:06,780
Just a dog.


00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,640
A dog?


00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,020
What happened to it?


00:06:09, --> 00:06:09,860
It got eaten.


00:06:10, --> 00:06:11,
Sam!


00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,400
Oh, come on.


00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,040
I mean, the bones were picked clean.


00:06:17, --> 00:06:19,
What kind of animal would
do something like this?


00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,
I guess if you're going to be
around here, you should know.


00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,660
It wasn't an animal that
picked those bones clean.


00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,420
It was the ghost.


00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,380
The ghost of Harrison Sadler.


00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Oh, come on.


00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,040
It killed and ate it because
dogs can tell if someone's a ghost.


00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,440
Dogs always bark to warn about ghosts.


00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,940
Oh, give me a break.


00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
Let's go.


00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
Oh, wait a second.


00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,980
Have you ever seen it?


00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,
Do you see that opening in those rocks?


00:06:54, --> 00:06:56,020
The ghost lives up there.


00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,
Some people say for over 300 years.


00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
Have you ever seen him?


00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,060
No one has.


00:07:03, --> 00:07:05,380
If you've never seen him,
how do you know he's up there?


00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,840
We've seen the skeletons.


00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,220
And the flickering light
in the mouth of the cave.


00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,800
It's probably just some
guy with a flashlight.


00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,
What?


00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,960
You saw the light, didn't you?


00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm not sure.


00:07:19, --> 00:07:22,020
This is just another one
of your dumb jokes, isn't it?


00:07:22, --> 00:07:22,980
Think what you want.


00:07:23, --> 00:07:23,840
Come on, Louisa.


00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,
I told you they were nonbelievers.


00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,290
Some nice beef stew.


00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,270
Um, I can eat more than that, Agatha.


00:07:42, --> 00:07:44,430
I just don't know how to feed you kids.


00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,690
First of all, you're not hungry.


00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,070
Now you are.


00:07:50, --> 00:07:52,
So what did you kids do today?


00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,210
We saw those Sadler kids again.


00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,
They said something about
a ghost who lives in this cave.


00:07:58, --> 00:08:01,270
They said he kills and eats dogs
and makes this light go off and on.


00:08:02, --> 00:08:04,730
Yeah, Jerry thinks he saw a ghost.


00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,850
I did not.


00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,370
I didn't see a ghost.


00:08:09, --> 00:08:10,
Just a light.


00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,090
Have you ever hear of
Aurora Borealis, Jerry?


00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,750
Yeah.


00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,390
It happens certain times
of the year or something.


00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,
Electric gets in the air and the
whole sky lights up in streamers.


00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,970
Well, it was the middle of the day
and... Just stay clear of Beech's cave.


00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,050
Do you hear me?


00:08:30, --> 00:08:33,350
I don't want you kids coming
home with any broken bones.


00:09:02, --> 00:09:03,030
Shh.


00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,230
It's me.


00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,
What are you doing?


00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,730
Listen, want to check out that cave?


00:09:08, --> 00:09:09,210
Are you nuts?


00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,430
It's the middle of the night.


00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,970
I know, but I can't sleep.


00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,
I keep thinking about that light I saw.


00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,810
Come on, Terry.


00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,810
Where's your sense of adventure?


00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:21,
I don't know.


00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,030
Where's your sense of night and day?


00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,430
You hear that?


00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,050
Yeah.


00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,
You think the ghost got it?


00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,890
I don't believe in ghosts.


00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,890
Well, neither do I.


00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,
But you know something's going on.


00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:38,
Come on.


00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,990
You saw Brad and Agatha.


00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,810
There's something about
that cave that they're hiding.


00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,010
Don't you want to find out?


00:09:44, --> 00:09:47,210
Yeah, but I don't know if we should.


00:09:47, --> 00:09:48,210
Oh, come on.


00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:50,
I'm kind of scared.


00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,
Me too.


00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,610
That's why it's fun.


00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,010
Be careful.


00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,030
Jerry, what if there really is a ghost?


00:10:00, --> 00:10:02,
Nah, it's something else.


00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,790
It's got to be.


00:10:05, --> 00:10:06,
Look.


00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,
That's not Aurora Borealis.


00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,990
Aurora Borealis.


00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,970
Whatever.


00:10:11, --> 00:10:12,
That's not it.


00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,590
Come on.


00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,790
Did you see that?


00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,970
Yes.


00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Oh, man.

208
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,310
This is amazing.

209
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,
It's taking us somewhere.

210
00:10:29, --> 00:10:30,
Listen.

211
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,430
You hear that?

212
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,
I think so.

213
00:11:08, --> 00:11:09,
Jerry!

214
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:19,
I don't think we should be here.

215
00:11:19, --> 00:11:20,600
You're right, you shouldn't.

216
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,
You're right, you shouldn't.

217
00:11:27, --> 00:11:30,220
You are both in serious trouble.

218
00:11:32, --> 00:11:34,800
It's dangerous to get involved with ghosts.

219
00:11:35, --> 00:11:36,
We didn't mean any harm.

220
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,360
No.

221
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,400
You're trying to trap me, aren't you?

222
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,620
Admit it.

223
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,020
We were just looking around.

224
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,800
Honest.

225
00:11:45, --> 00:11:46,
Silence!

226
00:11:49, --> 00:11:51,820
You think I'm a ghost, don't you?

227
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,820
I'm not.

228
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:55,040
I'm not a ghost.

229
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,960
My name is Harrison Sadler.

230
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,
I journeyed here from
England a number of years ago.

231
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,300
350 years ago.

232
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,420
I saw your gravestone.

233
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,680
Ancestors, not mine.

234
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,
I'm going to tell you a story, and
I want you to listen very carefully.

235
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:28,
In the year 1, a group of pilgrims sailed
from England to begin a new life here.

236
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:34,
But when they arrived, they faced
the most horrible winter imaginable.

237
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,940
No proper shelter.

238
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,620
Not enough food.

239
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,
There was no time to
prepare for any of that.

240
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,700
So cold.

241
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,
So hungry.

242
00:12:46, --> 00:12:49,380
Their blood froze in their veins.

243
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,800
One by one, they perished.

244
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,
Their deaths were so
awful, so painful, that

245
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:59,740
some refused to go to
their final resting place.

246
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,980
And so they lingered on.

247
00:13:02, --> 00:13:03,
Like you?

248
00:13:03, --> 00:13:04,
I told you.

249
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,040
I study ghosts.

250
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,740
I'm not a ghost.

251
00:13:09, --> 00:13:11,260
But your two young friends are.

252
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,340
Sam and Louisa?

253
00:13:12, --> 00:13:14,
Dead for three centuries.

254
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,680
I've studied them.

255
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,060
I've seen their evil.

256
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,300
You're the ghost.

257
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,380
Shut up in this dark old cave.

258
00:13:20, --> 00:13:21,
This sanctuary.

259
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,
They know I'm watching.

260
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,
But here, I'm safe.

261
00:13:26, --> 00:13:27,400
But I dare not leave.

262
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,620
No!

263
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,000
Sam and Louisa are just kids.

264
00:13:30, --> 00:13:31,
Kids like us.

265
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
They're not evil.

266
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,940
What are you going to do?

267
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
Let you go.

268
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:38,740
Why?

269
00:13:39, --> 00:13:41,080
Because you won't listen to me.

270
00:13:41, --> 00:13:42,840
He's going to eat us, Jerry.

271
00:13:42,841 --> 00:13:47,360
Go to the graveyard, to
the northeastern corner.

272
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,
You'll find your answer there.

273
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,780
To the graveyard.

274
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Now!

275
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,
Terry, slow down!

276
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,020
I don't know what to believe.

277
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Oh man, me neither.

278
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,420
Do you think he's a ghost?

279
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,396
He said Sam and Louisa were the ghosts.

280
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,420
But maybe he's lying.

281
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,700
Look, we gotta go to the graveyard.

282
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
I don't want to.

283
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,830
We gotta check it out.

284
00:14:11, --> 00:14:12,
The northeastern corner.

285
00:14:12, --> 00:14:13,660
That's what he said, right?

286
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,
Hey!

287
00:14:29, --> 00:14:30,750
The ocean's behind us.

288
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,
So, it's this way.

289
00:14:37, --> 00:14:38,
What was that?

290
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,810
I don't know.

291
00:14:54, --> 00:14:55,380
Louisa Sadler.

292
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,
Samuel Sadler.

293
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,940
Louisa and Sam.

294
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,
This is getting weirder over time.

295
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
Hey!

296
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,700
I'm glad you guys are okay.

297
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:08,360
We've been looking for you.

298
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,980
What are you doing here?

299
00:15:10, --> 00:15:11,
Are you alright?

300
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,320
We saw him.

301
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,420
Who?

302
00:15:13, --> 00:15:14,
The ghost.

303
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Oh no.

304
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
In the cave.

305
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
He really lives in there.

306
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,240
We've been here all our
lives and never seen him.

307
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
We did.

308
00:15:25, --> 00:15:26,340
Did he see you?

309
00:15:27, --> 00:15:28,
Yeah.

310
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,760
That's not good.

311
00:15:34, --> 00:15:35,
How did you get away?

312
00:15:35, --> 00:15:36,760
He let us go.

313
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
He said he's not a ghost.

314
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,
He told us to come here.

315
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
To look for something.

316
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,320
To look for what?

317
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,960
Your gravestones.

318
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,620
That ghost is clever.

319
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,
Making you think we're the ghost.

320
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,940
And you believe it.

321
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,880
You do.

322
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,280
I can tell by your faces.

323
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,300
If you're not ghosts, then
where did these come from?

324
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,820
Our ancestors.

325
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,
We just got named after them.

326
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,
That's all.

327
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,820
Now we're gonna show you something.

328
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,780
This is why we were looking for you.

329
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:07,720
Let me show you what the ghost of
Harrison Sadler is planning for you.

330
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
What is it?

331
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,380
You need to see it.

332
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,060
We need you to believe us.

333
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:16,960
Believe what?

334
00:16:17, --> 00:16:18,
Here it is.

335
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
See for yourself.

336
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,740
Jerry Sadler?

337
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,380
And Terry Sadler?

338
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,660
Our graves?

339
00:16:30, --> 00:16:32,
Freshly placed gravestones.

340
00:16:32, --> 00:16:33,
For you and your sister.

341
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,840
This is what the ghost
didn't want you to see.

342
00:16:36, --> 00:16:36,840
What does he want?

343
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,
What do you think?

344
00:16:38, --> 00:16:40,380
To eat you and bury your bones.

345
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Right here.

346
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,420
He saw you, Jerry.

347
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,
He'll come in a cave and find you.

348
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,820
No, he won't.

349
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
Yes, he will.

350
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,600
He won't stop till he gets you.

351
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,320
Your lives are in danger.

352
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,
So what do you think we should do?

353
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Get rid of the ghost.

354
00:16:54, --> 00:16:56,060
Stop his evil once and for all.

355
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,620
How are we supposed to do that?

356
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,840
Seal him up in his cave with rocks.

357
00:17:00, --> 00:17:00,
Rocks?

358
00:17:00, --> 00:17:01,980
But he's a ghost.

359
00:17:02, --> 00:17:03,
Can he float through that stuff?

360
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,940
The legend says the cave is a sanctuary.

361
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,720
If something evil gets
trapped inside, it can't get out.

362
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,
So that's what you have to do.

363
00:17:12, --> 00:17:13,
Trap the ghost.

364
00:17:13, --> 00:17:14,
Remember, Jerry?

365
00:17:14, --> 00:17:16,
That's what he thought
you were trying to do.

366
00:17:16, --> 00:17:16,740
Trap him.

367
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,020
You're right!

368
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,380
You have to attack him
before he attacks you.

369
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,300
But if he's evil, why
haven't you done it already?

370
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
We live here.

371
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,360
If we mess up, the ghost
won't stop at killing us.

372
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,
He'll haunt our house, our
family, get revenge forever.

373
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,760
You saw your graves.

374
00:17:37, --> 00:17:38,860
You want to live, don't you?

375
00:17:48, --> 00:17:49,
We'll keep watch.

376
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,660
No, you'll come with us.

377
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
I can't, Jerry.

378
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,300
I'm scared.

379
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:55,020
Here.

380
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,
Just use it as a lever.

381
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,020
That's it.

382
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
Do it.

383
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,840
Just a little more.

384
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,700
Well, well, well.

385
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,660
Here we all are.

386
00:18:27, --> 00:18:30,360
You've done well bringing the ghosts to me.

387
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,380
Ghosts?

388
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:31,940
Us?

389
00:18:32, --> 00:18:33,
You're the ghost!

390
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,
Jerry, the rocks.

391
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,920
You've terrified people long enough.

392
00:18:37, --> 00:18:38,
Liar!

393
00:18:43, --> 00:18:44,760
Get away!

394
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,260
Dogs!

395
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,720
Remember, Louisa?

396
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,440
You said it yourself.

397
00:18:51, --> 00:18:53,
Dogs recognize ghosts.

398
00:18:53, --> 00:18:54,
Dogs?

399
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,980
More ghosts.

400
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,640
Bring them to me.

401
00:19:00, --> 00:19:02,420
We never had a chance to live.

402
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,940
The first winter.

403
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,440
It wasn't fair.

404
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,
We never had a life at all.

405
00:19:08, --> 00:19:09,960
We all died in the cold.

406
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,440
Hungry.

407
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,340
We were so hungry.

408
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,900
Stay with us, cousins.

409
00:19:18, --> 00:19:19,
Join us.

410
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,920
We dug such nice graves for you.

411
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,020
Stay with us!

412
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Please!

413
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,410
Jerry, next time you see me
sleeping, don't wake me up.

414
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,050
They were always popping up out of nowhere.

415
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,750
Freaking us out.

416
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,610
But Louisa seemed so nice.

417
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,
That's what's so scary.

418
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,910
That's quite the story, kids.

419
00:20:04, --> 00:20:05,830
We didn't know where you'd gone.

420
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,
I'd say you've had quite the fright.

421
00:20:08, --> 00:20:09,
Quite the fright.

422
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,
But it's all over now and best forgotten.

423
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,930
Harrison's out of his dog.

424
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,730
He must have gone out of the cave.

425
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,590
Easy, boy, easy.

426
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,690
Bad dog, giving away
our little secret like that.

427
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,410
Maybe he's not such a bad dog, Brad.

428
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,010
Maybe he's quite a good dog.

429
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,910
Maybe you're right.

430
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,650
It's a little early for breakfast.

431
00:21:00, --> 00:21:03,650
Terry, Jerry, why don't
you kids go and set the

432
00:21:03,651 --> 00:21:05,850
table while Agatha
gets busy in the kitchen.

433
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,610
And don't say you're not hungry.

1
00:00:03, --> 00:00:34,
My Intro For My 20th Birthday.

2
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,700
I can't wait until tomorrow.

3
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,320
Aren't you excited, Walker?

4
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,780
I guess.

5
00:01:14, --> 00:01:15,
Halloween's okay.

6
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,360
Okay?

7
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,640
It's the best day of the year.

8
00:01:19, --> 00:01:21,
It's the one time you
get to be someone else.

9
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,820
So, what are you going as?

10
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,020
On Halloween?

11
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,440
I haven't really thought about it.

12
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,
I mean, look, I don't even know
if my parents will let me go out.

13
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,380
Well, hey, we could go
to the school carnival.

14
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,
They have games and everything.

15
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,660
That'd be fun.

16
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,020
I can't believe you're doing this.

17
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:50,040
Aren't you nervous about going out?

18
00:01:50, --> 00:01:51,
No!

19
00:01:51, --> 00:01:52,
Not even a little?

20
00:01:53, --> 00:01:55,740
Walker, that was miles from here.

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,400
They don't even know if anything
bad happened to those people.

22
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,380
Look, you know how much I love Halloween.

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Besides, who would want to kidnap us?

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,880
Yeah, good point.

25
00:02:11, --> 00:02:13,
So, what are you going as?

26
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,880
A superhero.

27
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,740
I've got the cape, a mask, and everything.

28
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,980
Why don't you go as a ninja?

29
00:02:25, --> 00:02:26,860
It looks stupid.

30
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,640
Come on.

31
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
How about a werewolf?

32
00:02:29, --> 00:02:30,
That's already been done.

33
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,920
What was that?

34
00:02:34, --> 00:02:35,
Hello?

35
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,920
Who's there?

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,
I'm hearing things.

37
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Ah!

38
00:02:45, --> 00:02:45,880
Shane!

39
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,400
Shanna!

40
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,940
You look like you're about
to jump out of your skit.

41
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,
You're wondering who's behind you, huh?

42
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,600
What are you guys doing here?

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,920
We thought it'd be cool, you know, to
come back and visit the old neighborhood.

44
00:02:56, --> 00:02:58,
We're only going to be here for a few days.

45
00:02:59, --> 00:03:00,
This is Walker, by the way.

46
00:03:01, --> 00:03:02,
Hey, I'm Walker.

47
00:03:03, --> 00:03:03,740
I know.

48
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,940
She just said that.

49
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,420
Walker's great.

50
00:03:11, --> 00:03:12,908
Shane and Shanna
used to be my best friends,

51
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,620
but they moved away
a couple of years ago.

52
00:03:17, --> 00:03:19,820
We weren't even sure if
you still lived here anymore.

53
00:03:20, --> 00:03:22,
But there you were,
walking down the street.

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,060
This is so cool.

55
00:03:25, --> 00:03:27,
You guys have to come
trick-or-treating with us.

56
00:03:29, --> 00:03:30,
Perfect.

57
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Did you hear that?

58
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,340
What?

59
00:03:39, --> 00:03:41,
I don't hear anything.

60
00:03:44, --> 00:03:45,900
I guess it was just the wind.

61
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,420
Yeah, you're probably right.

62
00:03:48, --> 00:03:49,
Ah!

63
00:03:49, --> 00:03:50,
Ah!

64
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Ah!

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,
She falls for it every time.

66
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,260
You are the world's biggest sucker, Drew.

67
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,
I'm getting sick of you two.

68
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,700
Oh, I'm scared.

69
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,780
Lee, save me.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,
Not me.

71
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,940
I'm scared of creeps.

72
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,040
Same old Tabitha and Lee.

73
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,040
Shane and Shanna, what
are you two doing back here?

74
00:04:16, --> 00:04:18,920
We didn't come to see you, that's for sure.

75
00:04:19, --> 00:04:20,
My heart is breaking.

76
00:04:20, --> 00:04:21,
So is mine.

77
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:22,875
See you later, suckers.

78
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Goodbye.

79
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,440
Those two are still
torturing you, huh, Drew?

80
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,210
It's getting worse.

81
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,700
Last year they snuck
into my Halloween party

82
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,
and pretended they were burglars.

83
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,220
It wasn't a funny joke.

84
00:04:40, --> 00:04:41,
It was a sick joke.

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,881
We thought it was for real.

86
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,081
Would you like to get back at them?

87
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,
Do dogs have fleas?

88
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,020
My dog doesn't.

89
00:04:50,955 --> 00:04:52,380
It's just an expression, Walker.

90
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,220
I got an idea how to get
back at Tabitha and Lee.

91
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,000
All you have to do is invite them
to go trick-or-treating with you.

92
00:04:59, --> 00:05:00,860
Shane and I will do the rest.

93
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
What's the idea?

94
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,340
You'll see.

95
00:05:06, --> 00:05:08,960
You want us to go
trick-or-treating with you?

96
00:05:09, --> 00:05:11,680
Well, you guys are so good
at pulling tricks on people.

97
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,951
We thought you could teach us something.

98
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,
Sure.

99
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,880
Lee and I will be wearing
space warrior costumes.


00:05:17, --> 00:05:17,440
Cool.


00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,940
So we'll meet you at 7
o'clock tomorrow night


00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,920
at the entrance to the
Willows neighborhood.


00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
See you then.


00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,750
It's all set.


00:05:29, --> 00:05:29,880
And guess what?


00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:32,300
They don't suspect a thing.


00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,380
Oh, great.


00:05:35, --> 00:05:36,740
I'm not sure what it is.


00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,680
Those two are up to something.


00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,220
It's too bad your friends Shane
and Shauna never showed up.


00:05:46, --> 00:05:48,
Guys, let's go to one more house.


00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Come on.


00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,280
I don't like the looks of this place.


00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,640
What's wrong, chicken?


00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,380
No one's here.


00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Let's go.


00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
My goodness.


00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,280
What wonderful costumes.


00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,980
Please come in.


00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,660
My husband would love to see your costumes.


00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Don't be afraid.


00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
My husband's being
sick and he can't get up.


00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,
But he'd be so happy to see your costumes.


00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,620
Oh, yes.


00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,320
That's it.


00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,
Go right up the stairs.


00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,
That's it.


00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,240
Go right up the stairs.


00:06:38, --> 00:06:41,040
Go right up and turn to the right.


00:06:41, --> 00:06:42,
Turn to the right.


00:06:44, --> 00:06:45,
That's it.


00:06:45, --> 00:06:47,240
My husband will be thrilled.


00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,
He loves children.


00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,000
Go right on.


00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,980
Go right in.


00:06:52, --> 00:06:52,840
Go on.


00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Go on.


00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Go on right in.


00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,440
Go on.


00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Go on.


00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,
Let us out.


00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,000
Let us out.


00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,240
Let us out.


00:07:01, --> 00:07:02,
Let us out.


00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Let us out.


00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,060
Let us out.


00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,
Let us out.


00:07:06, --> 00:07:06,900
Let us out.


00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:07,860
Let us out.


00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:08,020
Let us out.


00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:08,
Let us out.


00:07:08, --> 00:07:08,320
Let us out.


00:07:09, --> 00:07:10,
Let us out.


00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,340
Let us out.


00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,000
Let us out.


00:07:13, --> 00:07:14,
Let us out.


00:07:15, --> 00:07:15,800
Let us out.


00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,
Let us out.


00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,340
Let us out.


00:07:22, --> 00:07:23,660
Let us out.


00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,000
Let us out.


00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:27,001
I've done so much.


00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,320
There's no way I can
stay right here forever.


00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,
No.


00:07:33, --> 00:07:33,420
No.


00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No.


00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
No.


00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:37,920
No.


00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:38,260
No.


00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
No.


00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,320
No.


00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:41,321
No.


00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,
No.


00:07:43, --> 00:07:46,
It was just a really bad dream.


00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,850
Thank you.


00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,070
You're very welcome.


00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,950
I love your costumes.


00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:06,770
Look at that.


00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,050
Have fun trick or treating.


00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,010
Thank you.


00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:09,350
Bye, guys.


00:08:09, --> 00:08:10,
See you later.


00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,390
Hey, Super Drew.


00:08:17, --> 00:08:18,250
Getting ready to go out.


00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,290
I'm waiting for Walker.


00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:19,850
He's late.


00:08:20, --> 00:08:22,070
Drew, honey, I'm sorry.


00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,750
But I don't think I want
you going out tonight.


00:08:25, --> 00:08:25,630
What?


00:08:26, --> 00:08:27,
Why not?


00:08:27, --> 00:08:28,921
Well, I was just watching the news.


00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,910
And they still haven't
found those four people


00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,246
who disappeared the
last couple of days.


00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:32,970
And I'm worried.


00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,010
I have to go out.


00:08:34, --> 00:08:35,
It's Halloween.


00:08:35, --> 00:08:37,370
I've been looking forward to this.


00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,990
Dad.


00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,050
Honey, it's not like
children are disappearing.


00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,790
I mean, these were adults.


00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,650
That's right.


00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:46,290
Things like this happen all the time.


00:08:46, --> 00:08:47,270
Every day.


00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,
Plus, it wasn't even in this town.


00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,410
It was in the next town over.


00:08:50, --> 00:08:51,730
That's miles from here.


00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,
We can't keep Drew in a cage.

208
00:08:54, --> 00:08:56,
Now, she knows how to avoid bad situations.

209
00:08:56, --> 00:08:56,
Right, Drew?

210
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,810
Of course I do.

211
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,850
I'm not a baby.

212
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,930
Anyway, Mom, I'll be in a group.

213
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,210
Yeah, they'll be fine.

214
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:04,710
Just as long as you stay together.

215
00:09:05, --> 00:09:06,
Is that clear?

216
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,210
Hey.

217
00:09:11, --> 00:09:12,
Hi.

218
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,790
Walker, what are you supposed to be?

219
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,050
Beetle is 2?

220
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,
What?

221
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,
No, I'm a dark and stormy night.

222
00:09:23, --> 00:09:24,
Well, I see the dark.

223
00:09:24, --> 00:09:25,
But where's the stormy?

224
00:09:30, --> 00:09:30,950
Hmm.

225
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,010
Now I don't have to take a shower.

226
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,990
I'll see you guys later.

227
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,850
Stay together.

228
00:09:38, --> 00:09:39,
Yes, Mom.

229
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,990
Don't talk to strangers.

230
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:41,730
I know.

231
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,810
But call if there's any problem.

232
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,430
Everything's going to be fine.

233
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:47,
She promises to be extra careful.

234
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,630
Right, Drew?

235
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,
I do.

236
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,010
Please, don't worry.

237
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:52,030
I'll try.

238
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,730
You two kids have fun.

239
00:09:55, --> 00:09:55,710
Bye.

240
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:56,390
Bye.

241
00:09:56, --> 00:09:57,
See you.

242
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,990
There's Tabitha and Lee.

243
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,
Yeah, but where are your friends?

244
00:10:09, --> 00:10:10,390
Where's Shane and Shauna?

245
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,890
I don't know.

246
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,280
Here they come.

247
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,310
I can't believe we're trick
or treating with these guys.

248
00:10:20, --> 00:10:23,040
Look, I know they're planning
something to try and scare us.

249
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
But...

250
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,310
Four people still missing.

251
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,710
Whatever it is they're planning,
we'll have to freak them out first.

252
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,010
It'll be fun.

253
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,350
Now I get it.

254
00:10:43, --> 00:10:44,
Duh.

255
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,370
Well, if it isn't Mighty Mouse.

256
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,590
She's Super Drew.

257
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,010
Super Drag is more like it.

258
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,220
Are you two ready to get some candy?

259
00:10:54, --> 00:10:57,
Uh... Why don't we
wait a few minutes?

260
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,310
What for?

261
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,430
Uh...

262
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,010
Well...

263
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,250
Hey.

264
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,210
Did you hear about all the people
that have been disappearing?

265
00:11:09, --> 00:11:09,930
Yeah.

266
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,710
One minute they're here,
and the next minute, vanished.

267
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,650
Without a trace.

268
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,830
Maybe whatever's getting those
people is watching us right now.

269
00:11:19, --> 00:11:20,630
Maybe we're next.

270
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,
I hope nothing terrible's happened.

271
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,930
To who?

272
00:11:25, --> 00:11:26,850
Are you expecting someone?

273
00:11:27, --> 00:11:28,971
Uh... No.

274
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,370
Well, come on.

275
00:11:30, --> 00:11:31,
Let's go.

276
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,890
It's not like Shane and
Shauna to flake out like this.

277
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,610
Maybe something bad did happen to them.

278
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,730
What if my dream was a prediction?

279
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:58,430
Like somehow I knew Shane
and Shauna would be in trouble.

280
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,610
Don't say that, Drew.

281
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,210
It freaks me out.

282
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:00,990
I know, man.

283
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,266
We're going to be in candy heaven.

284
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,410
Let's see what we've got.

285
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,
Not bad costumes, though.

286
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,960
Is that Shane and Shauna?

287
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,
I don't think so.

288
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
You don't?

289
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,840
Oh, scary pumpkins.

290
00:12:28, --> 00:12:30,340
Speak to us.

291
00:12:30, --> 00:12:35,320
If you want to trick or treat, follow us.

292
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,620
We know a new neighborhood.

293
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,740
A new neighborhood.

294
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,000
A better place.

295
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,
A better place.

296
00:12:43, --> 00:12:44,
A better place.

297
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,900
Your friends are too funny.

298
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,320
I'm telling you, it's not Shane or Shauna.

299
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,
I don't think these things are human.

300
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
Of course not.

301
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,
They're your friends.

302
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,280
Hey, this is kind of fun.

303
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:58,
We'll go with you.

304
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,320
Come on.

305
00:12:59, --> 00:13:01,
Show us this better place.

306
00:13:07, --> 00:13:08,
Shane?

307
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,
Now, through the woods, move!

308
00:13:17, --> 00:13:18,
Come on!

309
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,590
A better place.

310
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,290
A better place.

311
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,
I wish they'd stop doing that.

312
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,370
I think it's funny.

313
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,306
Hey, Lee, which one do you think
is Shane and which one is Shauna?

314
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:31,770
I don't know.

315
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:34,210
It's kind of hard to tell a girl
pumpkin from a guy pumpkin.

316
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,
Don't keep moving.

317
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,870
Don't talk!

318
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,350
Shauna?

319
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:39,990
Is it you?

320
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,010
A better place.

321
00:13:41, --> 00:13:42,
A better place.

322
00:13:42, --> 00:13:43,
Move!

323
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,650
Move!

324
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,
This is a better place.

325
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,030
Look at all these houses.

326
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,890
Just look at them.

327
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,810
Come on, Drew!

328
00:14:03, --> 00:14:04,730
Hey, wait up!

329
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:39,320
Trick or treat!

330
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,710
I'm almost out.

331
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,850
But... But what?

332
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,370
Where is everybody?

333
00:15:18, --> 00:15:19,810
We're the only kids here.

334
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,430
That's what's so great about it.

335
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:23,
Check out all this candy.

336
00:15:23, --> 00:15:25,
It's going to take us a
year to eat all this stuff.

337
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,770
Tabitha, what time is it?

338
00:15:28, --> 00:15:29,050
It's getting late.

339
00:15:29, --> 00:15:29,650
We should get back.

340
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,730
Come on, guys.

341
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,430
Lots more houses!

342
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,990
What?

343
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,870
Lots more houses.

344
00:15:37, --> 00:15:38,646
What are you talking about?

345
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,
We're done trick or treating.

346
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,
We're leaving.

347
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,370
What's your problem?

348
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,590
We have to leave.

349
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,670
You cannot leave.

350
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,090
What do you mean we can't leave?

351
00:15:46, --> 00:15:47,690
More houses.

352
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,390
You must trick or treat.

353
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:51,810
Forever!

354
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,710
Listen, Shane and Shawna,

355
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,
I know you two like this little game,

356
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,
but you're not scaring us.

357
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,
Yeah, take off those stupid pumpkin heads.

358
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,370
They look fake anyway.

359
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,770
Yeah, your little Halloween joke is over.

360
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,690
More houses!

361
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,610
Lots more houses!

362
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,590
Treat forever!

363
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,410
We'll be!

364
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,730
Who are you?

365
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,010
What do you want?

366
00:16:24, --> 00:16:26,390
We want you to trick or treat forever!

367
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,710
Forever!

368
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,690
Houses!

369
00:16:30, --> 00:16:31,790
Treat forever!

370
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,590
Houses!

371
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,
Please let us stop.

372
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,820
I'm tired.

373
00:16:45, --> 00:16:47,340
No time to rest.

374
00:16:47, --> 00:16:48,
More houses!

375
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,960
I can't.

376
00:16:52, --> 00:16:53,800
We're so tired.

377
00:16:54, --> 00:16:55,300
Our bags are full.

378
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,620
We can't carry anymore.

379
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,860
Please let us go.

380
00:17:02, --> 00:17:03,840
Now it's empty!

381
00:17:04, --> 00:17:04,
Go!

382
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:10,370
Trick or treat forever!

383
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,210
Forever!

384
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:13,
You.

385
00:17:14, --> 00:17:15,
You're the ones.

386
00:17:16, --> 00:17:17,
You took them.

387
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,070
You kidnapped the four missing people.

388
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,770
Run!

389
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:45,810
Run!

390
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:46,
Hurry, get up!

391
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,650
I can't.

392
00:17:51, --> 00:17:52,
Where are they?

393
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,730
Where did they go?

394
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,850
Where are they?

395
00:18:00, --> 00:18:01,
Run!

396
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,060
You seem like such an obedient little girl.

397
00:18:13, --> 00:18:15,440
Make them one of us!

398
00:18:32, --> 00:18:33,780
You scared them pretty good.

399
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,040
It was you!

400
00:18:46, --> 00:18:49,040
I mean, at first I thought it was you,

401
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,350
but then I didn't.

402
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Oh, man.

403
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,
Those disguises were great.

404
00:18:54, --> 00:18:55,
But how?

405
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,
I mean, the way you just
changed and the way that beam

406
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
shot out of your head.

407
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,230
Your claw.

408
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,940
Okay, you guys.

409
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,
How'd you do that?

410
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,720
Well, there are advantages
to being an alien.

411
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,
An alien?

412
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Yeah.

413
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,
Before they moved away, Shane and Shauna

414
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,765
used to be my best friends.

415
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,240
They lived next door to me.

416
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,840
How come you never told me?

417
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,690
Would you have believed me?

418
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
I...

419
00:19:24, --> 00:19:25,
I don't know.

420
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:27,
Thanks, you guys.

421
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,041
Thanks for helping me
get back at Tabitha and Lee.

422
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,360
I hope I didn't scare them too much.

423
00:19:34, --> 00:19:37,001
Of course, I hope I didn't
scare them too little, either.

424
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,620
That was a blast!

425
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,341
You know, I think we're getting to
like Halloween as much as you do.

426
00:19:43, --> 00:19:44,980
Hey, it's the one time a year

427
00:19:45, --> 00:19:46,340
you get to be someone else.

428
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,930
Nice meeting you, Walker.

429
00:19:57, --> 00:19:58,
You, too.

430
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,230
We'll see you next year.

431
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,370
Thanks again.

432
00:20:06, --> 00:20:07,
Shane! Shauna!

433
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,260
Wait!

434
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,280
Do you guys want some
candy for the trip back?

435
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,
No, thanks.

436
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,800
It's not part of our diet.

437
00:20:14, --> 00:20:16,
But if you know where
some nice plump adults are,

438
00:20:16, --> 00:20:17,
we'll eat those.

439
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,820
You mean...

440
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,920
you eat humans?

441
00:20:22, --> 00:20:23,
Only when we're hungry.

442
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,
We just finished a
four-course meal earlier tonight.

443
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,000
Four-course meal?

444
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,220
The four missing people!

445
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,
Oh, by the way,
we're pretty full,

446
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,
but I wouldn't eat all that candy.

447
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,
It might fatten you up.

448
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,
And we will be back next year,

449
00:20:41, --> 00:20:42,
two feet again.


00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
Happy Halloween.


00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
you.

1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,430
Whoa. Hello. I'm R.L. Stine.

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,310
I write the Goosebumps books.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,990
The evil of the Haunted Mask lives
on in our story, The Haunted Mask 2.

4
00:00:15, --> 00:00:19,
This is the basement of the store
where the Haunted Mask was made.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,910
It looks as if the mask
maker left in a very big hurry.

6
00:00:24, --> 00:00:26,950
Wonder why? You'll soon find out.

7
00:00:27, --> 00:00:30,
Viewers, beware. You're in for a scare.

8
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:43,380
That party was awesome.

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,820
I think our costumes looked really good.
Our moms did a really good job.

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,800
Your costume was the
hit of the party, Curly Beth.

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,360
Everyone loves a two-headed girl.

12
00:00:50, --> 00:00:52,700
Are you going to wear it
tomorrow for trick-or-treat?

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,
I don't want to take a
chance on breaking it.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
What time is it anyway?

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,
It's after ten. We better hurry.
My mom's going to have a fit.

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,620
So is mine. She thinks something
fucking terrible is going to happen to me.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,660
Wait a minute. What's wrong?

18
00:01:08, --> 00:01:09,
What?

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
What?

20
00:01:14, --> 00:01:16,
Oh, man.

21
00:01:17, --> 00:01:18,
Gotcha.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,300
Well, well, well. Chuck and Steve.
Way to go, Curly.

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,660
How'd you know it was us, Curly Beth?

24
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,860
I don't know. I just got that
old Steve and Chuck feeling.

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,600
You should have seen your faces.
You guys were like...

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,
You were so much more
fun last year, Curly Beth.

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,740
I know. You were so much more scarable.

28
00:01:36, --> 00:01:37,280
That was last year.

29
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:40,805
Hey, whatever happened to that
Halloween mask you had last year?

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,
Yeah, that thing was amazing.

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,
Oh, that was terrifying.

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,700
I got rid of it.

33
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,260
How come? It was so cool.

34
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,900
It wasn't cool. It was evil. Really evil.

35
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,300
It wouldn't come off.
It became part of my face.

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,800
Ask Sabrina. She was there.

37
00:01:58, --> 00:01:59,980
Well, the mask definitely
wouldn't come off.

38
00:02:00, --> 00:02:01,320
Well, so it got stuck.

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,366
I don't want to talk about it.

40
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,830
Oh, come on, Curly Beth.
Just tell me where you got the mask.

41
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,
Forget it. Now will you tell me?

42
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,320
Give it back. Tell me where you got it.

43
00:02:11, --> 00:02:13,240
My mom made that sculpture.
It's very important to me.

44
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,600
Here, Steve. Steve, quit being a jerk.

45
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:18,660
You better not break that.
Don't give it to her.

46
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,420
When are you guys going to grow up?

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Give it back.

48
00:02:23, --> 00:02:25,440
Just tell me where you got it, Curly Beth.

49
00:02:25, --> 00:02:26,900
I want to be scary tomorrow night.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,600
He's sick of being a pirate for Halloween.

51
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:30,
Just tell me, Curly Beth. No.

52
00:02:30, --> 00:02:31,
Steve.

53
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,220
Thanks, Sabrina.

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,240
Yeah, thanks, Sabrina.

55
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,716
I guess you're just going to
have to be a jolly old pirate.

56
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,740
Come on, Curly. Let's go.

57
00:02:41, --> 00:02:42,
Yeah.

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,020
Well, maybe you could be a scary pirate.

59
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
Shut up.

60
00:02:49, --> 00:02:50,751
What did you do with that mask, anyway?

61
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,260
I buried it.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,320
In a place where no one will ever find it.

63
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:53,
I must hurry.

64
00:04:18, --> 00:04:19,770
Who's there?

65
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,210
It's just as I feared, isn't it?

66
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,950
Yes.

67
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,
Halloween has brought you back.

68
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,710
Yes.

69
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,090
I will stop you.

70
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,990
No.

71
00:04:46, --> 00:05:22,780
Wait until tonight.

72
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,980
Yeah, that's true.

73
00:05:24, --> 00:05:25,680
We're going to get this great start.

74
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,930
Hey, man.

75
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,210
Where were you?

76
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:33,870
Hey, Chuck.

77
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,431
I was looking for you after class.

78
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,710
Well, here I am.

79
00:05:37, --> 00:05:38,
What's wrong with you?

80
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,970
I'm bummed. Tonight's Halloween.

81
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,330
Duh.

82
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,810
Duh yourself.

83
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,850
This might be our last chance
to do something really scary.

84
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,370
Next year, we're going to
be too old for Halloween.

85
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:50,630
It's okay by me.

86
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,910
Well, it's not with me.
Life's passing us by, man.

87
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,010
It's just passing us by.

88
00:05:54, --> 00:05:55,791
There's stuff we've got to try.

89
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,970
The years go by, and before you know it,

90
00:05:58, --> 00:06:00,030
you're a drooling, disgusting old man.

91
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:01,285
I drool sometimes.

92
00:06:01, --> 00:06:02,891
Yeah, you're a disgusting young man.

93
00:06:03, --> 00:06:05,
No, cheer up.
We still get to go trick-or-treating.

94
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,370
That's great. Maybe we can get
our mommies to go with us, too.

95
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,050
I want to scare somebody.

96
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,230
Did you see that?

97
00:06:15, --> 00:06:15,910
Yeah.

98
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,890
Didn't it kind of remind you of
the mask Carly Beth had last year?

99
00:06:19, --> 00:06:20,870
Yeah. Hey, mister!


00:06:21, --> 00:06:22,310
Where'd you get that mask?


00:06:27, --> 00:06:32,
All I know is where you got your mask.


00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,840
Oh, where'd he go?


00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,
I don't know. He was right here.


00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,376
He pointed over there when I
asked him where he got his mask.


00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,
He pointed over there. Come on, let's go.


00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,060
It's just a bunch of old stores.


00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,
Yo, check it out.


00:06:52, --> 00:06:53,
Novelty shop.


00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,
Magic. Masks.


00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,240
You think that's what
that guy wanted us to see?


00:07:00, --> 00:07:01,
I'm not sure.


00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,420
I just have this creepy feeling.


00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:18,640
It came from around there.


00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,860
Come on.


00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,820
What is it, Steve?


00:07:26, --> 00:07:27,620
It's a back door to the store.


00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,
And it's open!


00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,020
Well, look, they're closed for business.


00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,980
I gotta get home and get ready for tonight.


00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,720
You gotta get in your pirate stuff.


00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,600
Forget that stupid pirate junk.


00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,260
Let's go in here.


00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,320
Maybe we can find some cool stuff.


00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,440
I don't like it, Steve.


00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,980
Oh, what do you mean?


00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
The door was open, wasn't it?


00:07:53, --> 00:07:54,660
Something just doesn't feel right.


00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:55,661
Let's get out of here.


00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,400
Come on, let's check out the basement.


00:07:58, --> 00:07:59,
Are you coming?


00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,060
No.


00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Chicken.


00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Junk.


00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,380
Cool.


00:08:59, --> 00:09:00,
Now this is scary.


00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,690
This is gonna look adorable on Steve.


00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,770
Don't you think so?


00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,990
Is that you, honey?


00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,830
Um, yeah, yeah, Ma. I'll be right there.


00:09:44, --> 00:09:45,
Yes.


00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,390
Yes.


00:10:00, --> 00:10:04,
Tonight, terror will stalk the streets.


00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,750
This is gonna rule.


00:10:07, --> 00:10:08,
Steve?


00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,
Yeah, I'll be right out, Mom.


00:10:19, --> 00:10:20,
Who's in here with you?


00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:21,800
Huh?


00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,220
I heard someone.


00:10:23, --> 00:10:25,
Yeah, well, you know
you're supposed to knock first.


00:10:26, --> 00:10:27,
I did.


00:10:27, --> 00:10:29,
Well, you're supposed
to wait until I say come in.


00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,270
Don't I have any rights around here?


00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,700
Are you sure you're alone?


00:10:35, --> 00:10:35,900
No, Mom.


00:10:36, --> 00:10:38,
I'm hiding the three
stooges inside my closet.


00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,310
Of course I'm alone.


00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,900
I don't need your sarcasm.


00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,640
I'm sorry, Mom.
I just need a couple minutes alone.


00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:44,841
I'll be right down, all right?


00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,
Anyway, I just came up
to show you your costume.


00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,
Remember how Chuck had a
parrot on his shoulder last year?


00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,960
Well, you're gonna have the same thing.


00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,700
Sheesh, Mom.


00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,680
This is great. I really appreciate it.


00:10:58, --> 00:11:01,321
Um, just give me a couple
minutes and I'll be right down, okay?


00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Okay.


00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's great.


00:11:04, --> 00:11:05,900
Wow. Pirate.


00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Oh, yes.


00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,020
Now this is way too cool.


00:11:18, --> 00:11:18,880
Steve?


00:11:19, --> 00:11:20,340
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming, Mom.


00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Oh, yes.


00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
Yeah?


00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Mom?


00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Mom, where are you?


00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,980
Here you go.


00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,680
It's all ready.


00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,
Oh, thanks, Mom. I'm late.
I have to get to Sabrina's.


00:12:04, --> 00:12:06,280
Do you have that mask from last year?


00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,660
Can I borrow it? I want to be a killer bee.


00:12:09, --> 00:12:10,
I thought you got rid of that mask.


00:12:10, --> 00:12:11,
I didn't like it.


00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,
I did get rid of it, and you're
lucky you only put it on once.


00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,620
Why?


00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,250
Because if you put it on
three times, it doesn't come off.


00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,840
Where do you get these ideas?


00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,810
Oh, I just... I guess I have
a bit of an imagination.


00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,640
It's great.


00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,320
I'll see you later, Mom.


00:12:30, --> 00:12:32,
Okay. Have a good time, sweetheart.


00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,700
I will.


00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Okay, bye.


00:12:38, --> 00:12:39,
Oh, be careful!


00:12:48, --> 00:12:49,
Go over there.


00:12:49, --> 00:12:50,
Okay.


00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,910
Do the duck walk, Curly Beth.


00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,320
It's going to be such a great Halloween.


00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,700
You know, Curly Beth,


00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,261
last year, when all that stuff
happened to you with the mask... Yeah?


00:13:02, --> 00:13:05,
I know you don't like talking about it, but
I just wanted to say, whatever happened,


00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,315
I'm just glad you're happy
and we're out here having fun.


00:13:09, --> 00:13:10,
I'm glad, too, Sabrina.


00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,020
Hey, look at Chuck.


00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,
I don't know this, uh, Chuck.


00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,
Is he, uh, one of
the Tataglia family?


00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,240
What?

208
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:24,
What?
I can't understand a word you're saying.

209
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,
What are you supposed to be?

210
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
A tough guy.

211
00:13:28,745 --> 00:13:29,745
Mafia. You know.

212
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
What?

213
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
A gangster.

214
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,030
Like in the movies.

215
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,
Oh. Where's Steve?

216
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,860
I'm going to get him.

217
00:13:41, --> 00:13:43,605
Did you find a good costume?
Is he still going to be a pirate?

218
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,860
I don't know.
We found this old party store.

219
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,340
Party store?

220
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,840
Where? On 10th Street?

221
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,
Um, yeah,

222
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,940
I think so. Just over the train tracks.

223
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,820
Did Steve go in?

224
00:13:55, --> 00:13:56,
It was out of business.

225
00:13:57, --> 00:13:58,400
So he didn't go in, right?

226
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
No, he didn't.

227
00:14:01, --> 00:14:02,760
Why do you care, anyway?

228
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
No reason.

229
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
Steve?

230
00:14:19, --> 00:14:20,
Come on, let's see how you look, honey.

231
00:14:20, --> 00:14:22,760
Um, yeah, I'll be right out, Mom.

232
00:14:33, --> 00:14:33,900
Why aren't you in your costume?

233
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:36,960
Um, I'm going to get
changed over at Chuck's.

234
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,800
Sparky?

235
00:14:39, --> 00:14:40,
What's the matter with you?

236
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,900
What have you got in there?

237
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,
Nothing. Just my costume.

238
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Sparky!

239
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,340
I swear, Mom, that dog is getting
more and more psycho every day.

240
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Sparky!

241
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,870
Oh, my!

242
00:14:58,035 --> 00:14:59,035
Come on, guys.

243
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,270
Thank you.

244
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,090
We'll see you later, Mom.

245
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:04,
Try to be home by midnight, Steve.

246
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,270
Good night.

247
00:15:06, --> 00:15:07,
Thank you.

248
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,750
Hey, over here.

249
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,900
Who's there?

250
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,700
Come here, young fellow.

251
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:58,701
No.

252
00:16:11, --> 00:16:12,
Who are you?

253
00:16:12, --> 00:16:14,
Don't be afraid, young fellow.

254
00:16:15, --> 00:16:16,
Come closer.

255
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,670
Is that you, Steve?

256
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,690
There's no Steve.

257
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,
I know it's you, Steve.

258
00:16:22, --> 00:16:23,810
I can tell from your clothes.

259
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,
They used to be his clothes.

260
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,
Before I took them.

261
00:16:27, --> 00:16:27,930
Took them?

262
00:16:28, --> 00:16:30,890
That's what I said, sonny boy!

263
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,430
No, Chuck, wait!

264
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,850
Chuck, wait!

265
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,770
Oh, man!

266
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,850
Oh, man, you were so scared.

267
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,910
You were shaking.

268
00:16:41, --> 00:16:42,
It's just a mask.

269
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,
Where'd you get it?

270
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,670
Come here, come here.

271
00:16:46, --> 00:16:47,700
Promise you won't tell anyone?

272
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,
You took it from that store?

273
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:52,605
The place was out of business.

274
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,910
Let me see it.

275
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:56,290
Can't tell anyone, okay?

276
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,730
You promise?

277
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,790
Yes, okay.

278
00:17:00, --> 00:17:01,070
Isn't it the greatest?

279
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:05,270
I'm gonna put some serious
fear into some people tonight.

280
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,
So let me see it.

281
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,851
This is gonna be a
Halloween to remember.

282
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,
Let me see it.

283
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
You wanna see it?

284
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,070
Oh, it feels like skin.

285
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,
Dry old skin.

286
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,410
I know.

287
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,950
Those spiders look so real.

288
00:17:36, --> 00:17:37,
Isn't it the greatest?

289
00:17:37, --> 00:17:38,
The greatest.

290
00:17:39, --> 00:17:41,250
How are you doing that voice?

291
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,990
What voice?

292
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,930
It's my own voice, you jerk.

293
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,250
Ooh.

294
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,310
Watch this.

295
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,430
Oh, thank you!

296
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,970
Hey, hey, give it to me!

297
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,090
Make me!

298
00:18:04, --> 00:18:06,
Just get out of here!

299
00:18:07, --> 00:18:08,
Ah!

300
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,630
Ah!

301
00:18:15, --> 00:18:16,250
Steve, are you nuts?

302
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,330
Shut your mouth.

303
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,610
What's wrong with you?

304
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,590
I just feel so tired.

305
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,806
We're just getting started.

306
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,
I just feel so tired all of a sudden.

307
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,970
I just need energy.

308
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,270
Energy is what I need.

309
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
I hate mints.

310
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,700
All right, would you quit doing that voice?

311
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,900
Listen, man, if you're
gonna be flipping out

312
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:44,901
like this, I don't think I
wanna be around, okay?

313
00:18:47, --> 00:18:49,260
What are you talking about?

314
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,081
We're gonna terrorize
the neighborhood!

315
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Ah!

316
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
Ah!

317
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,
This is our night!

318
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,080
I just need some energy, that's all!

319
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,880
You're disgusting!

320
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
You know,

321
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,961
I'm getting sick of you.

322
00:19:11, --> 00:19:14,881
You're a weak, stupid boy.

323
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,720
What's wrong with you?

324
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,960
Would you take off that mask, please?

325
00:19:19, --> 00:19:20,260
Steve, please!

326
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,000
Why don't you go home?

327
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,400
I don't wanna see your crybaby face.

328
00:19:24, --> 00:19:25,
What's happening to you?

329
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,320
Maybe I'm evil. Does that scare you?

330
00:19:28, --> 00:19:31,940
No. Yes. I don't know.
Just cut it out, Steve.

331
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,020
Oh, shut your mouth.

332
00:19:33, --> 00:19:35,
Leave me alone. You're nothing to me.

333
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860
Oh.

334
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,940
Forget you, then.

335
00:19:46, --> 00:19:47,
Let's go outside.

336
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,260
Ah!

337
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Ah!

338
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,360
Let's go over there.

339
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,820
Trick or treat!

340
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Here we go.

341
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,770
One for the duck.

342
00:20:06, --> 00:20:09,060
And one for the cat.

343
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Uh, tiger.

344
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,
Oh. Uh, tiger.

345
00:20:13, --> 00:20:14,
Thank you. Bye.

346
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
Bye.

347
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,
Feel the weight of this bed.

348
00:20:22, --> 00:20:24,320
We are cleaning up tonight.
Let's see what we've got.

349
00:20:24, --> 00:20:25,
Okay.

350
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,660
You guys!

351
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,440
Hey, Jack. Where's Steve?

352
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,360
There's something wrong with him.

353
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,840
We know that. No, I mean really wrong.

354
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,440
What are you talking about?

355
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,660
He's just acting like a jerk.

356
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:39,736
Maybe he's just bummed
because he has to be a pirate again.

357
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,700
He's not a pirate. He found this mask.

358
00:20:42, --> 00:20:43,900
This really creepy mask.

359
00:20:44, --> 00:20:45,
A mask?

360
00:20:45, --> 00:20:46,
Where did he get it?

361
00:20:58, --> 00:20:59,930
At the party store?

362
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,590
Did he get it at the party store?

363
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,006
I thought you said it was out of business.

364
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,066
Yeah, Chuck.
I thought you said it was out of business.

365
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,090
Well?

366
00:21:14, --> 00:21:15,
It was out of business.

367
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,770
Well, then how did he get it?

368
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,270
I promise.

369
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,
This is important. You better tell us.

370
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,
I can't catch my breath.

371
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,831
He, um... He... He what?

372
00:21:31, --> 00:21:32,750
He snuck in the back door.

373
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,250
Was the owner there? The shopkeeper?

374
00:21:34, --> 00:21:36,050
I don't know. I don't think so.

375
00:21:36, --> 00:21:37,870
It was so real.

376
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,
It was like skin.

377
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,270
What happened when he put it on?

378
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,
Um, first he was really
happy because he was,

379
00:21:50, --> 00:21:51,
you know, really
scary and he liked that.

380
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,920
And then he got really, really tired.

381
00:21:53, --> 00:21:54,
It was freaky.

382
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,630
We've got to find him, Chuck.

383
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,770
Steve is in trouble. Major trouble.

384
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,870
I'm so thirsty.

385
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,070
Look at that old man.

386
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,870
I need water.

387
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,050
I can't hear you. What did you say?

388
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,610
I need water. Please.

389
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,
He's got spiders on his head.

390
00:22:23, --> 00:22:24,730
No way, too.

391
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,
Steve.

392
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:15,270
Hey, you there.

393
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,
You there, stop.

394
00:23:18, --> 00:23:19,890
Please.

395
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,910
Hey, look at this guy.

396
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,770
Please.

397
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,
What do you want?

398
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,210
My mask.

399
00:23:33, --> 00:23:35,330
Help me take it off.

400
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,610
Let's go. He's just a little drunk.

401
00:23:40, --> 00:23:41,930
My mask.

402
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,810
Take it off, please.

403
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,010
Oh, you smell, mister.

404
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,910
Take it off.

405
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,730
Okay.

406
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,870
I'll try.

407
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,990
Hold still.

408
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,890
I don't see any bottom to this mask.

409
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,
Underneath my shirt.

410
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,
there should be a line.

411
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,730
There has to be a line.

412
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,330
I don't know what you're talking about.

413
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,070
There is no line.

414
00:24:12, --> 00:24:14,370
It's just a mask.

415
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,810
That's not a mask, mister.

416
00:24:16, --> 00:24:17,
That's your face.

417
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,930
No.

418
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,350
Please don't.

419
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,230
Did you guys find him?

420
00:24:30, --> 00:24:30,930
Nope.

421
00:24:31, --> 00:24:34,
I looked all over Maple
and up and down Davenport.

422
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,
I've got an idea.

423
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:36,930
Come on.

424
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,290
Where are you going?

425
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,680
I'm not going to argue with you.

426
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,740
You've got plenty of candy, two more
houses and then we're going to go home.

427
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,620
But Mom, you promised.

428
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,
It's getting late and it's
way past your bedtime.

429
00:24:52, --> 00:24:53,440
But you promised.

430
00:24:53, --> 00:24:55,420
Please, help me.

431
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Help me.

432
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,420
You should be ashamed of yourself.

433
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,620
No, wait. No line.

434
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,680
Can't get it off. No line.

435
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Please help me.

436
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,910
What happened?

437
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,690
I told you it was out of business.

438
00:25:22, --> 00:25:23,
Ugh.

439
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,
Why do you think Steve
would come back here?

440
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,
Because that's what I did.

441
00:25:39, --> 00:25:42,301
When the mask wouldn't come off, I came
here and the owner of the store helped me.

442
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,760
How did the store owner help you?

443
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,815
He told me to find a symbol of love.

444
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
I don't get it.

445
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:51,056
You know that plaster of Paris head of
me you were throwing around last night?

446
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Yeah.

447
00:25:52, --> 00:25:54,
Well, my mom made that
for me because she loves me.

448
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,800
Yeah, so?

449
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,640
So that's a symbol of love.


00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,820
The symbol of love that
defeated the evil of the mask.


00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
The haunted mask.


00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,
I don't know, Carly Beth.


00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,320
This is getting too weird for me.


00:26:09, --> 00:26:10,
Hello?


00:26:11, --> 00:26:11,620
Hello?


00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
There's no one in there.


00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,
Wait a minute. What's that?


00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
What's what?


00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,
I thought I saw something.
A shadow or something.


00:26:20, --> 00:26:21,400
I don't see anything.


00:26:23, --> 00:26:24,340
But I feel something.


00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
Do you feel it?


00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,
No.


00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740
What?


00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Something cold.


00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,
Maybe we should go, Carly Beth.


00:26:36, --> 00:26:38,300
We can't. He said the back door was open.


00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:38,880
Show it to me.


00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Do we have to?


00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,
Is anyone there?


00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,020
See, I told you. No one's here.


00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,020
I've got to make sure.


00:27:23, --> 00:27:25,
I've just got to make sure.


00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,310
Hello?


00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,870
Is anybody here?


00:27:47, --> 00:27:48,950
Nobody's here, Carly Beth.


00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,330
Steve's not here, okay?


00:27:54, --> 00:27:55,680
Where's the shopkeeper?


00:28:01, --> 00:28:03,060
Come on, Carly. Let's just go.


00:28:04, --> 00:28:05,
Carly?


00:28:15, --> 00:28:16,
You scared me.


00:28:19, --> 00:28:20,
Maybe Steve's okay.


00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,940
Yeah. Maybe Chuck's right, Carly Beth.


00:28:23, --> 00:28:25,880
Maybe he just took
off that stupid mask.


00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,420
He just took it off, and now he's at home.


00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,361
Listen, we'll go by his
house, see if he's there.


00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:32,665
I'll bet you that's where he is.


00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,060
I can just see him now.


00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,840
Sitting on his bed, kicking
back, counting his candy.


00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
I sure hope so.


00:28:55, --> 00:28:56,
Journey into.


00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,630
an old man.


00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,690
It can't be.


00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,
It has to be a dream.


00:29:02, --> 00:29:04,370
It's got to be a dream.


00:29:04, --> 00:29:06,630
I'm home. I've got to get home.


00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,750
Please, sir.


00:29:12, --> 00:29:14,
Please help me.


00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,
Your face.


00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,280
So old.


00:29:27, --> 00:29:28,680
So hideous.


00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:30,
So perfect.


00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,680
Who are you?


00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,
I am the evil that controls you.


00:29:37, --> 00:29:40,760
You are under my
power now, old man.


00:29:41, --> 00:29:42,700
I'm not an old man.


00:29:43, --> 00:29:44,
I'm a kid.


00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,
You were.


00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,001
Until you chose the mask.


00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,841
Now the mask and you are one.


00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,
You're an old man.


00:29:56, --> 00:29:59,700
A feeble, helpless old man.


00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,060
No, it can't be.


00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
It will be.


00:30:04, --> 00:30:05,740
You will do as I say.


00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,
Bring it to me.


00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,620
Bring what?


00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,300
The head of Carly Beth.


00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,600
Her head?


00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,760
The symbol of love.


00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,000
It lies in the mantle in her
warm and lighted house.


00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,
You mean that statue thing?


00:30:23, --> 00:30:24,
Yes.


00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,
Bring it to me.


00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:33,
If you ever want to see your young
face again, I will wait in the cemetery.


00:30:33, --> 00:30:39,300
I will wait amidst the
gravestones by the


00:30:39,301 --> 00:30:40,301
stroke of midnight and
not one second later.


00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
Do you understand?


00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,
Yes. Louder.


00:30:46, --> 00:30:47,
Yes.


00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Now go!


00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:55,920
Bring me the head of
Carly Beth or the mask


00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,420
stays on and you will
remain a feeble old man.


00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
forever.


00:31:03, --> 00:31:05,080
Well, it's 11.25 now.


00:31:05, --> 00:31:06,
He said he'd be home by midnight.


00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,
Did you try Chuck's?
I think they're together.


00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,440
No, but it's not important.


00:31:11, --> 00:31:12,900
We just wanted to stop and say hi.


00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,990
If you do see him, would you send him home?


00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,320
We will. Thanks, Mrs. Boswell.


00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,
Do you want some candy?
I have plenty left over.


00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,300
Uh, no.


00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,
That's okay. Good night. Good night.


00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Where is he?


00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,
We've got to find him. Maybe we
should call the police. The police can't


00:31:29, --> 00:31:32,780
help, Chuck. All the police
in the world can't help.


00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,640
These masks are alive.


00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:37,605
They take you over.


00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,
You're scaring me. You don't really
believe that stuff, do you? I told you.


00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,700
It happened to me.


00:31:45, --> 00:31:46,900
And I think it's happened to Steve.


00:32:03, --> 00:32:04,
Please.


00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,420
I need help.


00:32:06, --> 00:32:07,
Who are you?


00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,910
Are you hurt?


00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,
Do you need an ambulance? No, no.


00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,770
Just a glass of water.


00:32:16, --> 00:32:17,
Please.


00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,050
Well,


00:32:20, --> 00:32:22,250
I'll be right back.


00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,
Here. I hope this will help.


00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Hello?


00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Hello?


00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Strange.


00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,920
Gotta get going.


00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,
Gotta get going.


00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,840
Steve!


00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Steve!


00:33:57, --> 00:33:58,
Wait.


00:33:59, --> 00:34:00,900
Did you hear something?


00:34:02, --> 00:34:03,980
I guess not.


00:34:06, --> 00:34:07,
Steve!


00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,820
Steve!


00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,880
It's getting late.


00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,
I'm supposed to call my mom
from your house by midnight.


00:34:17, --> 00:34:20,441
This is about the only
place we haven't looked.


00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,420
Remember, Carly Beth,

where you scared me and Steve last year?

I remember.

Come on.

No.

Did you bring it?

Yes.

Don't show it.

Destroy it.

If I do, will you make me better?

If you don't,

I'll make you worse.

Your eyes will turn to pus.

Your tongue will
crawl in the dirt.

I'll make your bones soft like cheese.

Now smash it.

Smash the head.

But it is destroyed.

Carly Beth's mine.

Now smash it.

No.

No.

Then I'll bury you with spiders.

Can you feel it?

Please, please no.

Crawling over your tongue.

Creeping beneath your skin.

Okay.

I'll obey you.

I'll do anything you say.

You're groveling.

Good.

I like that in a boy.

Smash the head.

Please,

help me.

No more spiders, anyone.

-Smash it.

Now.

that which protects her is gone.

Steve.

Let's not keep her waiting.

Steve.

Maybe we should go.

One minute to midnight.

Steve.

What's wrong,

Carly Beth?

This is where I bury it.

That's where you buried the mask?

It's escaped. The mask is alive.

Carly Beth.

Carly Beth, calm down.

It's gone. It's just a hole.
It's gone. There's nothing there.

What is she talking about?

Carly Beth, please calm down.

Dear Carly Beth.

It's time to finish
what we started.

last Halloween.

Hold her.

Steve.

Steve, let her go.

The old man will do as I say.

I buried you.

I was released.

by the power of Halloween.

Now, your eyes will
see through mine.

So,

you will wear my face.

forever.

Oh my gosh, Steve.

Are you okay?

Remove that mask, young man.

Remove it now.

Hey.

Hey.

Is that all it is?

It's just a mask?

It's just a mask.

How?

When you tried to
protect Carly Beth,

when you threw yourself
in front of the haunted mask,

that.

was a symbol of love.

Boy, this is a little too deep for me. A
wading pool's too deep for you, Chuck.

We looked for you.

We thought you could help.

I was trapped within the mask.

This boy freed me.

and saved you.

Well, I didn't want her to get hurt.

It didn't seem fair, you know?

Halloween brought
the evil to life.

Your actions.

put it to rest.

Let us hope.

it stays that way.

Carly Beth,

your mom is coming to
pick up both you and Sabrina.

Thanks, Mrs. Boswell.

And Chuck, your dad
said you can sleep over.

Great.

How come you're so quiet?

What's wrong? Nothing.

I'm fine.

Do you want one?

I guess Halloween isn't such a big
deal for you anymore, huh? Yeah, I guess

I'm getting too old. Here, give me that.

Yeah, here. Well,

I'm making some hot chocolate.

You, uh,

think what I'm thinking?

Let's do it.

I hope you enjoyed that story.

That Steve is a good kid.

He brought me some of
his trick-or-treat goodies.

Mmm.

Cream filling.

My favorite.

Good night, everyone.

Good night.
