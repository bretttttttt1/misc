1
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,516
Don't worry. It's just a wolf album.
Come on, we're almost done with it.

2
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,832
- Caleb, mine!
- Carry on!

3
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,251
Start! Start!

4
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,667
No, Benjamin, we have to end this.

5
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,211
Come help me bury this.

6
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,515
What if someone digs it up?

7
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,556
God bless him with mercy.

8
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,715
- Hi, Alan.
- Hello, Miss Magruder.

9
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,431
- PopoÅ‚udnie, Alanie.
- Hi, Frank.

10
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,066
- All yours, Alan.
-Good, Bill.

11
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,915
Dorwij go!

12
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,716
Prepare to die, Parrish!

13
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,765
Hey, Parrish, what's the rush?

14
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,440
He is going to his father's factory!

15
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,363
He is going to dad now.

16
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,787
Hi Parrish! Run to daddy.

17
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,045
We will wait.

18
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,938
Hi Karl.

19
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,776
Hey, Alan, my man. i have
show you something. Come here.

20
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,191
I am working on it now
almost a year.

21
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,655
And I have a promise
and your father...

22
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,072
...to show him.
Come and take it.

23
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,167
So what do you think?
Do you think he will like it?

24
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,582
What's this?

25
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:09,171
What's this? This is the future. If I can get it
Wilt Chamberlain, I'm feeling...

26
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,711
...there will be a couple of them
in every closet in America.

27
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,926
It will be the height of fashion.

28
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,051
What's wrong?

29
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,934
- Nic.
- Alan!

30
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,520
Thank you, Bob. What are you doing here?

31
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,903
I told you, this factory is not like that
stadium. It is dangerous.

32
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,696
Dad, can I give you a ride home?

33
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,406
Ah, Alanie.

34
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,444
Is Billy Jessup hiring you too?

35
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,282
Son, you will
face it sooner or later.

36
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:46,253
Listen, if you're afraid of something,
you have to stand up and face it.

37
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,879
Now run, son.

38
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,422
Charles, you know better
than letting the child play here.

39
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,257
I'm sorry sir.

40
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,881
Oh what is that
kina so ki nuna min

41
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,890
Just a moment, sir.

42
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,018
What the hell...?

43
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,234
Get a fire extinguisher.
Bring it here.

44
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,032
What's this?

45
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,497
Who did it?

46
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,706
Shi ke nan?

47
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,003
I did it, sir.

48
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:50,480
Being a Persian doesn't mean
you can spend time with my girlfriend.

49
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,444
We are just friends.

50
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,108
Don't do it again.

51
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,361
Dorwij go!

52
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,154
- Let's go.
-Ok, let's bake together!

53
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,120
Targanie!

54
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,459
Cleanliness.

55
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,971
Alana?

56
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,595
Are you at home?

57
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:20,311
Oh, Alan, not again. Hurry up.

58
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,198
hard work, determination,
Looking happy...

59
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,826
...characters that they exemplify
The ghost of Brantford...

60
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,740
...from our ancestors
they were the first to live in this city.

61
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:37,161
Despite the harshness of our original nature
and our country's granite...

62
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,954
...we have...

63
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,170
- He is rich.
- I know everything in the morning.

64
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,460
You will find out everything tonight.

65
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,676
- That's right. let's go.
-Sam, we need to talk to Alan.

66
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,856
To, just muna right.

67
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,140
It's good.

68
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,528
I told your father what you told me
in the afternoon that it's not just Billy Jessup.

69
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,987
- Look, if I had known that, I wouldn't have...
- It's okay, dad.

70
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,117
But I'm proud of you.

71
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,079
You face them
even though you are outnumbered.

72
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:18,039
And because you treated him like a man
Your mother and I have decided...

73
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,375
... that you are ready to go
to a boys' school in Cliffside.

74
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,041
- So.
- Greetings.

75
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,757
You don't want me to stay here anymore?

76
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,388
Alana.

77
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,718
That's always the plan
that you are going to Cliffside.

78
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,104
I mean, the Parrishes are gone
to Cliffside from the 18th century.

79
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,265
Even your uncle Skylar was there.

80
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,150
Look at this. Parrish Hall?

81
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,902
This is the main dormitory.

82
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,445
This is good. The children are here on my behalf
because I'm Parrish.

83
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,114
Wait until I'm alive
in a building named after me.

84
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,625
It is my father's name.

85
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,081
It's good. Why don't you stay there?

86
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:05,249
I did. I wouldn't be who I am today
if not for the years I spent there.

87
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,635
Maybe I don't want to be who you are.

88
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,636
Maybe I don't even want to
become a church.

89
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,930
You won't be.
You don't have to start doing this.

90
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,140
- Sam--
- Take your shirt.

91
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,776
Then I guess I'm not ready for Cliffside.

92
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,565
We'll take you there next Sunday!
And I don't want to hear another word!

93
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,948
You won't!

94
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,986
I will never talk to you again!

95
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,326
- Sam...
-A'A.

96
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,836
- Sam.
- to you?

97
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,292
There is nothing. Just --

98
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,403
What are you doing here?

99
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,989
I brought your bike.

100
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,825
It is not necessary.

101
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,081
I'm driving
here Billy bought it himself.

102
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,334
I told Billy to stop being picky.

103
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:28,044
You should not waste your breath.
We need to talk about this sometime.

104
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,341
What is that?

105
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,012
- Did you hear that too?
- Of course I heard.

106
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,510
Hurry up. nailed it
This is really a factory game.

107
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,519
Gra?

108
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,533
"Jumanji.

109
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:04,209
Game for applicants
a way to leave your world behind.

110
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,004
You roll dice to move your tiles.
Two has a twist.

111
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,211
The first player to reach the end wins."
Do you want to play?

112
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,053
I stopped playing board games
five years ago.

113
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,220
Sara!

114
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,399
It must be magnetized or something.

115
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,813
Alan, look.

116
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,653
"They wake up at night, you better run."

117
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:40,237
These winged creatures are not very sweet.

118
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,748
What is that?

119
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,087
I don't know.

120
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,083
- Put it down, Alan.
- Good.

121
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,849
Oh a'a.

122
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,601
The game thinks I quit.

123
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,763
What do you mean by "mind game"?

124
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,772
"Wait in the forest...

125
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,234
...until the dice show five or eight.

126
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,660
"You have to wait in the forest"?
What does it mean?

127
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,549
Sara!

128
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,215
Mirgine dice!

129
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,180
Sara!

130
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,007
I thought it was just a bed and breakfast
what this city needs.

131
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,928
Well, it's really hard to pass it by without paying attention.
Especially full of furniture.

132
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,311
Oh boy.

133
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,098
I kept forgetting
how big this place is.

134
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,814
Judy, Peter, come look at this.

135
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,025
I will have a party
the in.

136
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,524
And the bar here in the living room.

137
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,159
This is amazing.

138
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,074
I am sure you and your children
they will be very happy here.

139
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,039
Shi ke nan...

140
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,704
It actually belonged to my brother who died.

141
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,715
He and his wife passed away
just last winter.

142
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,554
Is it something or what?

143
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,890
Yes indeed.

144
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,075
So what do you think young man?
Is it enough for you?

145
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:39,132
Peter did not say a word
since it happened.

146
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,627
Oh look.

147
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,922
I repented. How bad.

148
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,345
He is fine

149
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,141
We barely knew our parents.
They are always absent.

150
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,523
Skiing in St. Moritz,
hazard w Monte Carlo...

151
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,356
...travel in the darkest Africa.

152
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,443
We don't even know if they love us.

153
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,029
But when the sheikh's boat sank...

154
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,945
...they managed to write to us
nice goodbye letter...

155
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:13,241
...who was found floating
A bottle of champagne in the trash.

156
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,208
I'm sorry.

157
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,971
They were devoted parents.
It's a car accident in Canada.

158
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,303
- So you will send me these deposit documents?
-First thing tomorrow.

159
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,085
I have to call the key
That's why.

160
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,175
Peter, please take your toys.

161
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,897
Peter, take this box to the attic.

162
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,776
Then we can all eat ice cream.
Ina Bourbon.

163
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,800
What? What's this?

164
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,387
Zan is a Motel 6.

165
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,768
To, don Allah.

166
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,338
I didn't see any guano.

167
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,010
He said like this.

168
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:35,092
It is an African bat. A boy said
saw them in the 60s...

169
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,603
...but we don't have bats
as in New England.

170
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:39,933
That's what he saw.

171
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:44,442
Well, whatever it is, it's gone.

172
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:49,318
The bat is not something I have to worry about
in this house anyway.

173
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,107
What do you care?

174
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,071
To, da kaina...

175
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,864
...I don't want to stay at home
where someone was killed.

176
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,291
- Was he killed?
-So.

177
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,498
Little Alan Parrish.
I'm saying his father did it.

178
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:09,084
There are 1,001 places he can hide
body in this house.

179
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,341
Especially when he starts cutting it.

180
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,547
Hi sama!

181
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,059
Kids, you don't want to be late
on the first day of school.

182
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,523
- No sign of a bat, madam.
- Do you hear?

183
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,653
There is nothing to fear
in this house.

184
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,178
I can't believe I have to see it
his director after the first day.

185
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,933
What do I do?

186
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,438
Now let's try to relax
and they finished dinner.

187
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,020
Talk about something else.

188
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,523
We found out why you did it
this house is very cheap.

189
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,815
Twenty-six years ago, a boy named
Alan Parrish used to live here.

190
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,443
One day he just disappeared.

191
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,537
Because his parents cut him off
in small pieces and hidden in the walls.

192
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,542
OK, that's it. I'm sick and tired
you lie girl. You have less.

193
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,633
Well, I have nowhere to go
in this stupid town like that.

194
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,762
But just for your information,
it's not a lie.

195
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,462
Heard something from the past?

196
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,173
Do you miss mom and dad?

197
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,226
A'A.

198
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,761
Liar.

199
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,432
If you don't cut it.
they will refer you to a psychiatrist.

200
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,274
Where do you think they are going?
send if you don't start talking?

201
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,915
If they stop me at the permit office, I will call you.

202
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,630
The school bus should be here
every minute.

203
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,305
Do you still have the keys to the house?

204
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,384
are you listening to me?

205
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,265
Hello?

206
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:09,980
Hello?

207
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,391
what?

208
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,523
Maybe I should wait with you
har bas din yazo.

209
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,860
Did your parents use them?
put you on the bus?

210
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,199
A'A? A'A.

211
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,031
Are you sure?

212
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,162
I can drop you off.

213
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:29,246
No, don't worry about us.
The bus will be here in a moment.

214
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,250
Well. Please be good today.

215
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,174
You hear.

216
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,516
Ji me?

217
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,534
Where did he come from?

218
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,852
Let's bring it here.

219
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,250
M. They are stuck.

220
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,337
"Jumanji, he plays with them
who want to get...

221
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,463
...a way to leave the world behind.

222
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,341
Roll the dice to move your tile.
Two has a twist.

223
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,594
The first player to reach the end wins."

224
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,769
It must be microchips or something.

225
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,603
you come first.

226
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,568
It's good.

227
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,357
Trouble.

228
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,632
"Bite changes can cause itching,
it makes you sneeze, it makes you shiver."

229
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,917
A'A!

230
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,504
"It won't be an easy goal.

231
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,264
The monkeys slow down the pace.

232
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,349
What's this?

233
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,063
I bet the monkeys came
from playing.

234
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,224
Mosquitoes too.

235
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,900
I didn't see that part.

236
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,156
"Dancers, be careful."

237
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:43,421
"Fascists, beware, don't start."
unless you have to finish.

238
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,673
Interesting results
sport...

239
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:49,426
... will disappear only when the player does so
enough for Jumanji to call his name."

240
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,758
- The monkeys are gone.
- Good.

241
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,922
- Put it down.
- Wait!

242
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,592
When we finish the game everything will disappear.

243
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,056
Gara mu yi shi
or aunt Nora will win.

244
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:03,474
We should pass quickly.
I mean, it's not about any technology.

245
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,361
No, you threw twice.

246
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,237
You get another turn.

247
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,943
Roll over

248
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,279
Five.

249
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:20,833
â€œHis hands are sharp.
He likes your taste.

250
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:25,337
Your team better hurry.

251
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,048
I don't like that sound.

252
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,010
Judy, someone is here.

253
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:56,653
This is not true, Peter. It is a hallucination.

254
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,495
Run, Peter!

255
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,006
I am back.

256
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,018
My bike.

257
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,650
Did anyone roll a five or eight?

258
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,903
Ya yi.

259
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,906
Good luck! Good luck! Good luck!

260
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,791
Goodbye goodby goodby!

261
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,997
Goodbye.

262
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,129
I'm sorry if I scared you.
I'm sorry if I scared you.

263
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,334
Goodbye.

264
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,999
I am back!

265
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,509
Mother! Father!

266
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,839
I'm home!

267
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,428
I am back!

268
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,687
It's me! It's me, Alan, mom and dad!

269
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,646
I'm home! I am back!

270
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,189
Are you my sister?

271
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,229
A'A.

272
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,194
I'm Judy and this is Peter.

273
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,859
Where is mom? Is dad in the factory?

274
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,574
the...

275
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,701
...Alan Parrish?

276
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,868
Yes. Who are you?

277
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,877
We live here now.

278
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,043
Where are my mom and dad?

279
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,041
We don't know.

280
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,299
This house has been empty for years.

281
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,302
Everyone thought you were dead.

282
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,647
I'm sorry.

283
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,069
-- He said they were about 2 feet tall.
Red fur, long tail.

284
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,985
- Give me this information again.
- Fur Fur with a long tail.

285
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:22,092
Get out of my car, please.
and he went to the street.

286
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,093
- What year is it?
- It's new.

287
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:32,512
- No. What year are we in?
-1995, tuna?

288
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,645
- Ninety five...
- Do you have an ID?

289
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,933
Let me guess,
It's in your second Tarzan costume, right?

290
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,943
- Twenty-six years old.
- are you from there?

291
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,649
I was

292
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,314
But I'm in Jumanji.

293
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,200
Indonesia He was in the Peace Corps.

294
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,753
- Carl Bentley, the only man.
-Is this person related to you?

295
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,791
- Yes, sir, this is our uncle.
-Does he always do this?

296
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,801
Well, yes, he is a vegetarian.

297
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,011
Get out of here!

298
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,638
Monkeys. Monkeys.

299
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,311
Are you okay upstairs?

300
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,524
He was injured in the head
a few months ago.

301
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,996
Do not move!

302
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,578
Thief! Hello!

303
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,667
- Stop! stand!
- Don't move, don't move.

304
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,173
Hey, wait a minute!
Where are you going?

305
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,755
To find my parents!

306
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,425
Hurry up.

307
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,619
Yes!

308
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,927
My father made shoes here.

309
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,514
They are the best shoes
a New England.

310
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,182
Hello!

311
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,114
I'm sorry.

312
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,111
A simple girl.

313
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,785
You know what happened
to the shoe factory?

314
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:48,332
Yes, it happened.
Like everything else in this city.

315
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,169
It is very cold.
How about coffee?

316
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,514
Why would they close Parrish Shoes?

317
00:36:56,256 --> 00:37:00,727
When his son ran away, Sam said
whatever happened to him.

318
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,853
His time, his money...

319
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,514
Beat.

320
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,151
After some time, he stopped coming to work.

321
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,520
He stopped paying attention.

322
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:15,905
I don't think anyone loves their child
more than Sam.

323
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,946
In.

324
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,534
You will freeze there.

325
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,839
Goodbye.
Are the churches still there?

326
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,835
- I see them from time to time.
- So?

327
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,595
They are on Adams Street.

328
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,820
Our parents also died.

329
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,455
They were in the Middle East
compromise when--

330
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,252
Our father worked in advertising.

331
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,218
I bet you miss him, eh?

332
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,387
Ne ma.

333
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,643
It's going there again.

334
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:29,604
Look, I know you're worried and all,
but let's finish the game.

335
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,985
We? Why do you need me?

336
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,113
Well, just in case
other scary things are coming out.

337
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,899
Besides, there is a lion in my aunt's room.

338
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,909
Brother Ringling?

339
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,699
She will come home soon.

340
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,582
Won't she be surprised?
I hope you are not allergic to cats.

341
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,508
Larry, we need wheels.
Help me.

342
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,643
Did we hit her that hard?
-No, it looks like a strange bite.

343
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:19,825
- Yes, this is another one, okay.
-Jesus, over 50. What the hell is going on?

344
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,867
- Take it easy now. Relief.
- Hey, look.

345
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,120
- Shin ba Miss Thomas ba?
- Who is that?

346
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,407
- Real estate agent.
- silence.

347
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,995
To listen.

348
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,746
Do you hear?

349
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,627
Ji me?

350
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,796
Get in the car.

351
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:43,382
Well, think. what came out
playing in front of me?

352
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,927
There is a lion
a bunch of monkeys and...

353
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,595
Ku!

354
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:55,228
Nothing, nothing.
It's just a bug, but we're safe here.

355
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,145
Look? We are fine

356
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,198
As long as we stay down
it can't be that far, okay?

357
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,908
Don't worry. We are fine

358
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,199
Well. He can't get us in here.
It cannot pass through the glass.

359
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,535
we are fine.

360
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,373
Can one of you drive?

361
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,504
No? Well, that's not a problem.

362
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,879
My father allowed me
back the car and cross the road.

363
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,592
Once.

364
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,348
So what's going on?

365
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,179
- Fasten your seat belt.
- Let's go then!

366
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,349
Wait a minute. What? Wait

367
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,443
Alan, up!

368
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,671
Sliced â€‹â€‹cake.

369
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,882
So.

370
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,436
Alana.

371
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,985
Keep that away from me!

372
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,239
When will you help us play?

373
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,121
We have to hurry.
Our aunt will return home later.

374
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:34,455
Well, fine. You can let her know
that she is the former owner of this house.

375
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:39,589
I hope you understand that when my parents are not here.
this house is mine.

376
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,840
Oh, my goodness.

377
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,756
No more banana leaves.

378
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,969
So.

379
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:58,353
What do you think about these monkeys
will they do for the environment?

380
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,728
Hello?

381
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,554
What happened?
Do you shave with a piece of glass?

382
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,099
What happened?
Clampetts getting a sale?

383
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,809
Do you want to cook?
I have never shaved.

384
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:43,816
Where are you going?

385
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:48,905
Or maybe Peter and I were joking
and you just watch

386
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,489
Na gode, na gan shi.

387
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,660
So if you don't help us
with the ke yi?

388
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,292
I don't know.
I almost picked up where I left off.

389
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:01,500
I wonder if Mrs. It's Niedermeyer
he is still teaching sixth grade.

390
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,846
Come on, Judy, it won't help us.
He was scared.

391
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,765
With what?

392
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,853
You are afraid. It's okay to be afraid.

393
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,855
Let's go set it up in the living room.

394
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,702
You have no idea
what are you going through?

395
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,205
Whatever it is, we will deal with it
themselves. We don't need your help.

396
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,038
I don't think so.

397
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:43,625
You think of monkeys
Are mosquitoes and lions bad?

398
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,756
This is the beginning.

399
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,174
I saw things only you saw
in your dreams.

400
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,219
Things you can't imagine.

401
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,434
Things you can't see.

402
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,764
There are things
who hunts you at night.

403
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:05,231
Then something screamed.
Then you hear them eating.

404
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,943
And you hope for God
that it is not a dessert.

405
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,649
Fear?

406
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,945
You don't even know what fear is.

407
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:18,081
You won't last five minutes without me.

408
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,366
So---...

409
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,998
...will you help us?

410
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,294
I will watch...

411
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,463
...but I wasn't afraid.

412
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:46,359
Peter, that's great.

413
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:50,943
Turn is psychology.
My father used to show me that all the time.

414
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,195
Prepare?

415
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,117
So.

416
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,495
Alan, are you ready?

417
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,655
There is no "perfect".

418
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,715
I will try again.

419
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,222
Alan, it doesn't work.

420
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,654
Oh a'a.

421
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,155
It's not your time.

422
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:36,818
Yes, I started jumping. Then Peter twice
because he got two.

423
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,236
Now it's mine too.

424
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:43,158
Aa, duba.
Two of these parts are yours, right?

425
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,667
Who are the other parts?

426
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,957
The elephant is mine.

427
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:56,342
You play the game
I started in 1969.

428
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,057
I have to play.

429
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,222
It's not mine.

430
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,016
That is who?

431
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,360
Sara Whittle.

432
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,124
She stayed there.

433
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,711
This place gives me goosebumps.

434
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,096
We had fun on the porch.

435
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,895
I know she still won't stay here.

436
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,603
She may have married Billy Jessup
and living in a caravan.

437
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,267
- Hurry up.
-Let us at least ask.

438
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:55,564
- Maybe she knows where Sarah went.
- Of course she will know. She is intelligent.

439
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,323
Good talk.

440
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,403
I remember the living room was much bigger.

441
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,117
Hello?

442
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,917
- Can you help us?
- Do you have a meeting?

443
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:12,251
- No, we are trying to find someone.
"Madam Serena can't see anyone right now."

444
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,586
Well, maybe you can help us.

445
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,757
What's this?

446
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,139
We are looking for someone
who lived here.

447
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,801
No, I have lived here all my life.

448
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,345
To, to dole ne ku san Sara Whittle.

449
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,311
What do you want from Sarah Whittle?

450
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,484
Sara?

451
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,734
No, I don't use that name anymore.

452
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,779
Sarah Whittle?

453
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,035
Do you want to cook?

454
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:53,792
Twenty-six years ago you played a game
with a little boy in the street.

455
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,126
He plays the drums.

456
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,014
How do you know that?

457
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,557
I am Sarah's little boy.

458
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,307
Alana?

459
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,491
you killed her.

460
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,449
Bar say
and the doctor will call you back...

461
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,990
...at the closest opportunity.

462
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:33,836
Dr. Boorstein, this is Sarah Whittle. To listen,
if you can please call me as soon as possible.

463
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,838
I think I have to have it
My dose is checked.

464
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,672
This is the event we talked about
that didn't really happen?

465
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,088
Oh boy.
Got another episode today...

466
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,848
...and a little boy
he really didn't go away.

467
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,850
I live in his living room
drinking lemon

468
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,479
If you can call me, I really will
interested in your translation.

469
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,265
Thank you very much.

470
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,185
- He will call me again.
- We are waiting...

471
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,904
- Allah! Aaa ba aaa!
-Sara. Sarah.

472
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,235
- A'a, a'a, a'a.
- He is fine. Sarah. Please.

473
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:06,278
I have spent over 2,000 hours in therapy
I convinced myself that there is no such thing.

474
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:09,072
What happened to you was terrible
I created this thing...

475
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,536
Sarah, that was awful. That was terrible.

476
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,121
It's terrible, really.

477
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,712
But it is true. Truth.

478
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:21,047
No, no, that's not true, Alan. your father
he killed you and cut you down.

479
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,506
Sarah, so.

480
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,888
Did my father do this?

481
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,517
My father could hardly hug me...

482
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,599
...except that I will be cut into pieces.

483
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:38,059
Twenty-six years ago
we started playing a little.

484
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,522
And now...

485
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:44,156
...we will all sit down
and we will finish it.

486
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,192
And guess what.

487
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,031
Your turn.

488
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,750
A'A.

489
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,668
In.

490
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,914
Play the game, Sara.

491
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,921
- Yes, no.
- Sadness.

492
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:08,840
Just give me a cube and you can
go home You don't have to play.

493
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,758
Thank you, Alan.

494
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,641
Oh my God! How do you do this?

495
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,940
It's the law of the jungle, Sarah.
You will get used to it.

496
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:22,194
When I think of all the energy I spent
think of yourself as a bright spirit--

497
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,946
Go ahead, read on.

498
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,612
"They grow faster than bamboo.

499
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,615
The school, za su zo maka."

500
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,535
Great.

501
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,506
Oh my God. Tell me this is not happening.

502
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:46,044
Yes, that's right. Stay away from the wall.
Do not touch anything.

503
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,301
No fast movement.

504
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,014
- They are beautiful.
- Yes, they are good.

505
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,309
Don't touch the blue ones.
They are shooting at poisoned chariots.

506
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:05,692
And definitely stay away from nails.
Big yellow.

507
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,398
How big is yellow?

508
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,370
Piotr!

509
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,372
I found you! Grab his hand!

510
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,659
Take it away from me! Take it away from me!

511
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,380
Oh God na!

512
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,641
- Hold the child.
- Do I have it? Be right back.

513
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,350
Oh God na.

514
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,516
I'm sorry, Angus.

515
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:47,901
Harvest time!

516
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,664
Are you all right?

517
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,245
Piotr.

518
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,545
Oh God na!

519
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:12,263
My car. Oh my car.

520
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:13,547
Carl, come in, please.

521
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,134
Please come in, Carl.
Has anyone seen Carl?

522
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,430
I can't believe it.
Start, start, please. Yes!

523
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,896
- Karl? Zo in Carl.
- Carl nan.

524
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:27,688
Where the hell have you been?
We have an animal control environment.

525
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,196
Enter Stan and Willy.

526
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:33,576
I'm going to old Parrish
to investigate a suspicious figure.

527
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,662
I should be a firefighter.

528
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,750
So.

529
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,210
Sara!

530
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,756
Take your hand off me!

531
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,763
- The game is not over yet, Sarah.
- That, nawa no.

532
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,765
Now you are not in the forest.

533
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,224
Stand! You don't do that to people.

534
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,106
It's good.

535
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,786
Anyone fancy an iced tea?
I will make tea.

536
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,954
Alan, please, when I play the final game
this game ruined my life.

537
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,174
- Did he ruin your life?
-So.

538
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:36,134
â€œWait in the forest
until it shows five or eight on the dice."

539
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,308
I'm a little girl, Alan.

540
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,510
you disappeared.

541
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:47,483
And a group of bats surrounded me
like this kore will titi.

542
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:49,481
I was scared.

543
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,646
I'm sorry, Alan.

544
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,482
No one believed me. I am alone.

545
00:53:55,649 --> 00:54:00,496
Sarah, I am also 26 years old.

546
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,832
Ne ma.

547
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:08,917
It's okay, Sara. We are also afraid.

548
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,382
But when we end the game
everything will disappear.

549
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,132
What if I get stuck in the game?

550
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,921
You won't do it.

551
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,720
Because I won't stop playing.

552
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,351
Neither did I.

553
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,637
Ni ma.

554
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,987
Hi Sarah.

555
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,363
Don't God?

556
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,041
I knew it was going to be a bad day.

557
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,128
Hey, come on, we'll be fine.

558
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,381
We just have to hold on to ourselves.

559
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,085
And fight all.

560
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:19,067
"The hunter from the darkest wilderness...

561
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,283
...makes you feel like a kid."

562
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,076
What's this?

563
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,708
Van Pelta.

564
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:38,090
You coward!
Come back and face me like a man.

565
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,600
Bai isa ba, Sonny Jim.

566
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,019
It's coming, ready or not.

567
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,790
Hai ka!

568
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,667
drop the weapon
and raise your hands up!

569
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,328
Shit, I don't agree.

570
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,339
So even if Alan gets out of this situation...

571
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,920
...that will happen
frequently.

572
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:04,840
When you carry suppressed anger
it attracts negative energy...

573
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:08,930
...and things happen, like the end
in the forest. It is not a coincidence.

574
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,344
There are no accidents.

575
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,602
That is who?

576
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,270
- Turn me over.
- Really? Great.

577
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,185
You should have told us
there is a man who hunts people.

578
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,196
Well, I don't know, okay?
It's just a throw away.

579
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:24,279
Is that why you don't want to play?

580
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,157
Don't you want to play anymore?

581
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,370
Mr Mun Fara-Something 26 years old -
before and now-we-have-to-finish-it?

582
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,419
What is happening to this person?

583
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:41,084
He is a hunter. It kills things. Well
he does. Now he wants to kill me.

584
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,592
- Why are you?
Yasa ni?

585
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:46,722
I don't know. you will think
it will be a waste of his time.

586
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,757
Maybe he needs something for his wall.

587
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:50,392
- Persia.
- Your turn.

588
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,554
Have you ever talked to him
about your difference?

589
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:59,022
- Are you crazy? The man has a gun...
-Don't call me crazy, Alan! Whenever.

590
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:03,155
Then everyone called me crazy
I said you were drawn into the game.

591
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,571
- Maybe I should stop.
-So.

592
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,656
I am the girl who saw you killed.

593
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,242
Do you think someone has appeared?
On my birthday?

594
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:14,659
- Hello, I have already shot. I will turn.
-Billy wanene?

595
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:18,917
Who are you, owl? Come, madam
Serena, dig deep into your consciousness.

596
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,752
- Here, just roll.
- Find memory...

597
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,632
...your ex-boyfriend Billy.

598
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:26,796
- The boy who stole your bike?
-The big boy who took you to the movies.

599
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:31,308
"Don't be fooled, it's not thunder.
Staying there would be wrong."

600
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,139
- No, you are not big. NOT--
- Yes you are.

601
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,851
- I know it's you, but who am I?
- Yes you are. I don't have to take risks.

602
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,607
Do you hear it?

603
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,133
go

604
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,761
A firgice!

605
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,547
- Hurry up.
-Gra!

606
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:17,971
Don't look back!

607
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,255
Not this game!

608
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,054
Why don't you catch the game, Peter?

609
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,893
Just let it go, honey. Yes Libra.

610
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,683
- Where are you going?
- He will fetch water!

611
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,442
Well, let's go. Hurry up.

612
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:08,022
- Hello?
- This is Aunt Nora. Where have you been?

613
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:11,237
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
You have the wrong number.

614
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,283
Jira ni!

615
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,884
- What can I do for you?
- I will fill it.

616
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,429
You know they stopped
they did in 1903.

617
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:44,225
Cholera. Then I will need it
replacement weapon.

618
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,813
Well, there is a waiting period.

619
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:50,068
And you have to fulfill them.

620
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,197
Or I can fill them.

621
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,952
Luiza.

622
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,412
Now someone asked
you don't get it here.

623
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,502
You're not a postman, are you?

624
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,931
Alanie!

625
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:20,427
Natsu.

626
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,440
It's good.

627
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,283
Here, boy.

628
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,329
A'A!

629
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,458
- Piotr!
- Piotr!

630
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,616
- Peter, are you okay?
- It was good!

631
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,244
I can't believe you did.
It was very cold.

632
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:04,873
- I'm cold. Oh my God.
- It was good.

633
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,371
Alana.

634
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,871
It's a good job.
Come and give me the game. let's go.

635
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,815
Oh a'a.

636
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,731
Be natural.

637
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,732
Hello!

638
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,947
Hide the game.

639
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:48,913
I don't agree with that.
Whenever there is a problem, I bump into you.

640
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,662
YES? I don't know
what are you talking about.

641
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,752
- That's it. I agree with you.
- I'm not going anywhere.

642
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,924
Just --

643
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,797
Shi ke nan.

644
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,756
wait a minute. You can't take it, it's...

645
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,516
- Her fiancÃ©.
- Wait. You said it was your uncle.

646
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,763
Well. I will be back soon.

647
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,442
Outbreak

648
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,272
Remember what you said
you will never leave your friends.

649
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:21,157
- We will finish the game later. Well?
- Later?

650
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:23,660
Van Pelta. Van Pelta.

651
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,863
I advise you to go home now.

652
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,452
It's good.

653
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:36,130
Now how do we do that?
finish the game?

654
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,042
We can't.
We couldn't have done this without him.

655
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,301
Judith!

656
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:42,637
what?

657
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,178
What happened?

658
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:49,470
I thought I could finish the game by myself.
I am doing only 10 seats.

659
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:52,306
"The law of Jumanji has been broken...

660
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,691
...you will slip
even more than your brand."

661
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,519
Have you tried to cheat?

662
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:00,814
No, I tried to roll the dice
so they landed at 12.

663
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,199
Oh, okay, baby.
Well, that would be cheating.

664
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,662
Peter, your hand! Look at your hands!

665
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:38,443
Come in, that's Willy.
They cleaned Larry's things.

666
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,322
I can't stop them.
Get the National Guard here now.

667
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,108
Well. What about it?
I know you know.

668
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:49,037
Yes. But you won't
Believe me even when I tell you, Carl.

669
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:52,574
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
How do you know my name is Carl?

670
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,538
I know more than that.

671
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,625
I know you are working
on the press line at Parrish Shoes.

672
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,085
They called you Sole Man.

673
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,421
Sole Man, yes, that's right.

674
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:05,679
I was there too, man
until old Parrish kicked me out.

675
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,010
- Ya kore ka?
- Yes, boy.

676
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:11,598
And I have something, I can turn around
the whole city around.

677
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:14,057
- Your shoes.
- Na al'ada.

678
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,397
Listen to Carl?

679
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,234
I know it doesn't make much sense
after 26 years...

680
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,236
...but I'm sorry.

681
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,738
I'm sorry.

682
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:26,821
Sorry for what?

683
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,572
Yes, Alan.

684
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,249
Thanks. Hurry up.

685
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,455
What's going on?

686
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:39,997
Well, it seems there is a sale, honey.

687
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,845
You just saw three monkeys
on a bike, right?

688
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,597
- Right.
- Beautiful girl. Hurry up.

689
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:54,261
Maybe we can get him out on bail
with a check.

690
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,020
Goodbye.

691
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,932
Tell me this coward
If he wants to--

692
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,405
Child!

693
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,284
Get out of my way!

694
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,656
hi boy! What you up to?

695
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:02,670
- Give it to me, boy!
-A'A!

696
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,089
Hello!

697
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,171
- Piotr!
-Help me!

698
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,843
Take me!

699
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,677
- Shi ke nan.
-Oh my God, Peter. Hurry up.

700
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:26,520
Shi ke nan.

701
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,375
- There is.
- Wait here.

702
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,889
I found you girl.

703
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:56,762
A'A.

704
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,473
When Alan heard your troubles,
Zai zo.

705
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:03,266
He didn't even know I was here.
It won't work. Your plan is broken.

706
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,732
-Don't move or I'll blow your brains out!
- Good.

707
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,647
- Good.
-Call the police!

708
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,736
- That should be enough.
- Oh, by God.

709
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,244
Price confirmation!

710
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,963
If you let me go, I can keep it all.

711
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,300
It's like the Twilight Zone
but it is true.

712
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:33,219
Please, you have to help me with this.

713
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:36,052
I know I will regret it.

714
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:39,184
Well. Just hold on.

715
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,096
- Good.
- To, na sake ku.

716
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,606
What do we do now? Hello

717
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,438
- You will stay here.
- My keys!

718
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,102
It is for your own benefit. Stay there.

719
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:52,568
- My slap buttons. Wait!
- It's something I did!

720
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,732
- It could!
- You will thank me one day.

721
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,116
Shigo, Carl, ja kodi.

722
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,529
The hostage situation in Sir Sav-a-lot.
A woman and two children.

723
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:03,121
Looks like a criminal with a weapon
in the helmet you reported.

724
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:05,455
Karl? Zo in Carl.

725
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,541
- Lorraine? Import.
What is Sir Sav-a-lot?

726
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,456
- It's a deficit.
- Move.

727
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:13,252
- Wait, wait, wait. Slowly, slowly.
-Well. All right, all right.

728
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:15,136
Don't worry, I've done it before.

729
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:16,967
Once.

730
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,784
Ina Sir Sav-a-lot?

731
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,790
- Monroe and Elm.
- Cocin Episcopal.

732
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,202
Not a church anymore.
It's a fast burger.

733
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:51,168
Or at least it was. I don't know
what is left of it. People are going crazy.

734
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,207
Judith!

735
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:05,678
We have company.

736
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:08,598
No. Everything is fine. He is a traffic policeman.
He will support us.

737
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,407
- Here's the game.
-Hurry up. Get out of here.

738
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,869
Rats.

739
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:34,609
- Kashe siren. A can! Shi ke nan.
-Ok guys.

740
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:44,452
Woman, stop winking.
I can shoot you at any time.

741
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,827
So why don't you do it?

742
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:48,615
You didn't roll the dice, Alan did.

743
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,954
Yes, it is. Press the brake.

744
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:54,337
- Hit the brakes!
- I hit them. I'm hitting the brakes!

745
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:57,715
- Hit the brakes!
-Brake! I'm hitting the brakes!

746
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,296
He should be here any minute.

747
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,773
Sara!

748
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,325
- Is everything okay?
-So.

749
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,696
- Where is Peter?
-I'm here.

750
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,574
Great.

751
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:39,549
So remember, there are seasons
it will never be out of your control.

752
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,509
Three tape ends.

753
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:47,048
Uncommon updates
takes place in Brantford, New Hampshire.

754
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:50,058
There are ninety eight people
hospital and symptoms...

755
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:53,938
...starting with an indescribable fever
and rashes until violent.

756
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,724
Local resources are limited
to the point.

757
01:13:56,891 --> 01:14:02,864
And state health officials are asking now
People with these symptoms should call 911.

758
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,827
I have it.

759
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:54,407
Alan, talk to him. Please?

760
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,826
What? We don't have time for this, okay?

761
01:14:56,993 --> 01:15:00,088
I know, but it's a baby
and tried to help.

762
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:02,748
- All right, come on.
- Goodbye.

763
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,088
Judith, zo.

764
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,589
I warned you about this, Peter.

765
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:12,767
No, you want to play this game.

766
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:18,022
What are you crying about? you don't cry
Well? Keep digging.

767
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,274
Go ahead, head up.

768
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,694
Crying didn't help
someone do something, okay?

769
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:28,199
You have a problem,
you face him like a man.

770
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,787
Hello. Hello-

771
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:42,005
I'm sorry. He was buried twenty-six years
in the deepest, darkest forest...

772
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,006
...but still I became my father.

773
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:48,170
He's fine. Come here, I'm sorry.
Hey, it's okay.

774
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:51,172
Do you remember what you said?
It's okay to be afraid.

775
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,466
Not him.

776
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,559
What's this?

777
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,399
It's good.

778
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,321
Prepare?

779
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:18,784
Don't worry, we will change you
back to your old self in no time.

780
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:21,372
Because this is where we will enter
and together...

781
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:24,209
...we will stay,
we will finish this game.

782
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,793
It doesn't matter...

783
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:27,333
...Co.

784
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:42,265
I immediately felt at home.

785
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,598
Lorraine, this is Carl.

786
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:18,304
I think I know who is behind this.

787
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,391
Zan is Parrish.
Give me support.

788
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,565
Lorraine;

789
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:30,980
Wait Wait!

790
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,569
Now what?

791
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:33,903
stand!

792
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,239
Wait! stand!

793
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,785
Is there a problem sir?

794
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:43,584
- Oh, can I give you a ride home?
- Where do you live?

795
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,461
Jefferson Street. The old Parrish house.

796
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,248
Do you have children? Boy and girl?

797
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:51,088
- Oh my God. What happened?
-Enter.

798
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,298
I will explain everything on the way.

799
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,292
Sadness! Take it!

800
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:27,453
We have to get to this house.

801
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,469
- Aren't we going to play somewhere else?
-A'A.

802
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:38,882
I grew up in this.
It's something that scares me.

803
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:44,353
- Well, now it's mine.
- Sarah, if you roll a 12, you win.

804
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:49,065
OK, ready? be right back

805
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,273
He is fine

806
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:00,161
"Every quarter of the month.
it will rain...

807
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:01,912
...in your lagoon."

808
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:03,823
Summer.

809
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,366
Well, at least we're in it.

810
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,669
So, sure.

811
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:34,194
Well, a little rain never hurt anyone.

812
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:35,946
Yes, but too much can kill you.

813
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,528
Hurry up.

814
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,194
This way!

815
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,122
- What should we do now?
We are reaching a higher level.

816
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:52,380
- Good.
-Hurry up! stay together!

817
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:53,881
Peter, go!

818
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:09,726
Are you okay, Peter?

819
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,484
- Judith!
- Alan?

820
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:14,894
- to you?
- What's this?

821
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:19,732
To swim! To go! To go!

822
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,164
- It could!
- Judy! To swim! To go! movement!

823
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,668
To continue!

824
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:34,626
Stay on the table!

825
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:37,382
Peter! Feet out of the water!

826
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:42,467
A kan chandelier!

827
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:46,016
Stay with Piotr!

828
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:52,936
Hi Sarah.

829
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,152
Piotr!

830
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:08,952
Dakata, Sarah!

831
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:13,794
Are you all right? Are you all right?

832
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:30,052
When --?

833
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,643
- It could!
- Alan!

834
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,318
Judith? Bitrus!

835
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:45,030
Don Allah malam, ki koma
and let me hold it, please.

836
01:21:45,192 --> 01:21:48,162
Maybe it's nothing.
Maybe they left the TV on loud.

837
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,073
Bitrus? Judith?

838
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:56,045
I've always wanted to do this.
Can you go back please?

839
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:18,525
- Alan, give me your hand!
- Alan!

840
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:24,194
- Take my hand!
- I have it.

841
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:28,702
Alanie!

842
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,046
Take the game.

843
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:49,465
Here. There you go.

844
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:57,106
- Are you okay?
-So.

845
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:05,238
Alan, you wrestled me with an alligator.

846
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:09,901
Another crocodile.

847
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:14,452
Are alligators in
that little edge on the back leg.

848
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:16,580
Hurry up.

849
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:21,546
My mistake.

850
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,175
He is fine

851
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,276
Hurry up.

852
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:51,030
Well, now it's mine.

853
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,116
I have it.

854
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:56,449
Colonel Mustard in the library
and a lock.

855
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,373
Tips.

856
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,042
It's good.

857
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:15,351
"Be careful of the ground you stand on."

858
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:18,388
The ground is faster than sand."

859
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,483
- Alan! Shi ke nan.
-Help me!

860
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:26,145
- Help me.
-Well. Well. Keep calm.

861
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:27,984
don't fight. Keep calm.

862
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,318
-Na nutsu.

863
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,534
- Take it!
-Shi ke nan. Ja!

864
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:36,413
Well. I have it. Avert!

865
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,831
Keep calm!

866
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:43,541
Hurry up!

867
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:47,003
Oh my God! Well.

868
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:51,337
i found you --

869
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:54,257
Stop giving me broken things!

870
01:24:56,675 --> 01:24:58,268
"There's a lesson..."

871
01:24:58,427 --> 01:24:59,895
Shi ke nan.

872
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:04,524
"There is a lesson for you to learn."

873
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:06,564
Oh, I found you.

874
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:12,198
"Sometimes you turn around and turn around."

875
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,945
- Oh, did I hurt you?
-No.

876
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,739
about her.

877
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:24,044
Goodbye Judith. Goodbye.
He was quick to think.

878
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:26,876
Sarah and I love it
to get off the floor.

879
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,882
Then it's your turn, Peter.

880
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,793
It's good.

881
01:25:37,716 --> 01:25:39,593
I think I lost you again.

882
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,979
Thank you for being with me this time.

883
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:50,229
"Do you need help? Just wait.

884
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:54,241
We help you. Each of us has eight."

885
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,910
What's this? What's this?

886
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:07,125
- Nic.
- You will not go... for anything.

887
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:14,174
Peter, my father holds an axe
in the wood. Go get it!

888
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:17,010
- Good.
- Rushe! Go go go go!

889
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,606
Sara!

890
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:01,467
Judith?

891
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:03,640
Piotr?

892
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:05,853
BA--

893
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:12,360
Ba...

894
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,155
- Piotr!
- Judy! After you, take it!

895
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:29,207
Aunt Nora, it's me. Peter.

896
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:38,007
I'm sorry. I can't talk now.
I will explain later.

897
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,672
- Sara.
- to you?

898
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:42,512
Your turn.
You can finish if you roll a seven.

899
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:45,427
- I can't roll.
-Put the cube in your mouth.

900
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:48,518
Judith! bring the game. Emergency!

901
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:55,107
Judith!

902
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:04,245
Are you okay?

903
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,532
I'm fine. Help them.

904
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,204
Hi Judith. Hurry up.

905
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,498
- Judy!
- Judy.

906
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,050
Ka ba ni dan lido.

907
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:29,062
â€œYou're almost there, and there's a lot at stake.

908
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,394
But now the ground is starting to shake."

909
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:33,058
Judith!

910
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,778
- Oh God na!
-What? What?

911
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,074
I hope mom and dad are here.

912
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:47,079
Ne ma.

913
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:01,177
Her only chance is to complete the game!

914
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,134
Your turn!

915
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:04,764
Oh God na!

916
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,272
Get the game! The game!

917
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:22,190
No, I won't let you go!

918
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:32,204
Alanie!

919
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:52,433
Do not move.

920
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:58,143
Tashi

921
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:04,987
What's in your hand?

922
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:08,653
Save it.

923
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:20,916
End of story, Sonny Jim.

924
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:23,710
Game over. start running.

925
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,176
A'A.

926
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:30,384
Aren't you afraid?

927
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:32,434
I was terrified.

928
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,225
But my father told me...

929
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:38,896
...you should face everyday
What are you afraid of?

930
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:47,860
Yaro nagari.
You are finally acting like a man.

931
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:50,704
Any last words?

932
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:03,045
Jumanji.

933
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:07,049
To Jumanji.

934
01:31:09,547 --> 01:31:11,265
No, Alanie, no!

935
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,822
Co--?

936
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:42,140
I forgot my explanation.

937
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:48,738
Dad, I'm glad you're back.

938
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:51,524
I only left for five minutes.

939
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:56,162
It seems to be longer.

940
01:32:57,655 --> 01:33:00,704
Hey, I thought you told me
You will never speak to me again.

941
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:08,501
Whatever I said, father, I'm sorry.

942
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:13,346
Listen, Alan...

943
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,591
I was angry.

944
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,851
I'm sorry too, son.

945
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:27,561
See, you don't have to go to Cliffside
if you don't want.

946
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:34,067
Let's talk about it tomorrow. Man to man.

947
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:38,864
What about the father to his son?

948
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,662
Great.

949
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:46,542
Hey, I have to go now.
I am an honored guest.

950
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:49,875
Tata?

951
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:58,224
Ya riga at 196--
I mean, today at the factory...

952
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:00,556
...it's not Carl Bentley's fault.

953
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,771
I put the shoe on the conveyor belt.

954
01:34:06,182 --> 01:34:08,560
I'm glad you told me son.

955
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:10,900
Gratitude.

956
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:13,364
Bye, Father.

957
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:15,567
Hello and welcome.

958
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:29,081
- Clear Smoke! Judith and Peter!
- Alan.

959
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:31,591
They are not here.

960
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:35,091
It was 1969.

961
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:37,847
They're not even there yet.

962
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:10,334
I started to forget
how to be great.

963
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:14,300
It doesn't matter
as long as we don't forget each other.

964
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,177
I'm Judy and Peter.

965
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:20,348
Alan, there is something
I want to.

966
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:25,061
And I better do it
before I feel like a child a lot.

967
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:48,501
Maybe they don't teach driver training
in sixth grade, right?

968
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:05,051
Happy Kirsimeti.

969
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,933
Do you like any of them?

970
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:17,360
No, father. He is a new coach.
It's doing amazing.

971
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:20,696
- No, it's not a bra, it's a shoe.
- Honey, they are here.

972
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:24,408
Listen dad, I have to go. Happy Christmas.
We'll pick you up tomorrow, okay?

973
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:27,870
You will be the best Christmas present of all.
Wallahi wallahi! Wallahi wallahi.

974
01: 36:28,032 --> 01:36:31,377
- Are they here? let's go.
-I, zo. Shi ke nan.

975
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:32,913
- Hi.
- Lisa, hello.

976
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:34,881
I'm sorry.

977
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:37,041
Jim! I'm glad you did.

978
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,087
- Thank you. This is my wife Martha.
- Hi Marta. This is Sarah.

979
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:42,301
- Hi Sarah.
- Where are the children?

980
01:36:43,298 --> 01:36:45,141
Oh God, there they are.

981
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:47,806
How do you know'?

982
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:51,355
Think. Guess what, of course.
They are your children.

983
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:53,562
You are truly our children.

984
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,899
Judith and Peter.
Children, say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Parrish.

985
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:58,404
Nice to meet you.

986
01:36:58,563 --> 01:37:00,406
Nice to meet you.

987
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:04,323
You are as we remember you.

988
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:09,161
I feel like we know a lot about them.

989
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:11,079
because you know--

990
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:14,416
- Tell Alan a lot about them.
-Yes, and I told her.

991
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:17,837
- I will get presents.
- Of course, honey.

992
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:19,751
Well, we love children.

993
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:22,591
- Happy Kirsimeti.
- Cold.

994
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:26,799
So when can you start?

995
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:31,472
We thought about going skiing
vacation in the Canadian Rockies.

996
01:37:31,637 --> 01:37:33,014
"NO!
"NO!

997
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:36,358
I'm sorry.

998
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:38,732
We... just...

999
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:41,990
You must interact with this ad
on a new line, pronto.

1000
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:45,777
No problem. you know,
Maybe I can start next week.

1001
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:50,915
It will be good. Let me introduce you
other people you will work with.

1002
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:55,750
Come to our house, it is your house.
ls. Whenever you want.

1003
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:08,008
What is this noise?
