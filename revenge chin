Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith
As the Clone Wars draw to a close, Darth Sidious emerges ready to execute the final piece of his plan to rule the galaxy.
Sidious is ready to send his new apprentice, Darth Vader, into action and kill the remaining Jedi.
However, Vader struggled to choose the dark side and save his wife, or remain loyal to the Jedi Order.
 
Lock him up, R2.
Master, General Grievous' ship is right ahead—
The one crawling with vulture robots
I saw. It will be easy.
- Weird, did you get that? - Got it, Red Leader.
Mark my location. Form your squad behind me.
We are following you, General Kenobi.
Set S-foils as attack positions.
This is where the fun begins.
Let them pass between us.
They are all around me. get them out of my-

- They outdid us. - Here they come.
OK, R4.
No, no, no, no—no, nothing special.
Surge all powerplants, R2. Stand next to the thrust reverser.
We got them, R2.
Flying is for robots.
- I was hit. Anakin? - I see them. buzz robot.
R4, be careful. you have one-
Honey.
They are turning off all controls.

In the name of

I can't see anything. My cockpit is fogging up.

Master, I will not leave you.
Get him, R2.

R2, hit the center eye of the buzzing robot.
- Yes, you found him! - Great, R2.
The general's command ship is ahead.
Well, did you notice that the shield is still there?
I'm sorry, Master.
I have a bad feeling about this.
they are there. catch them.
R2, find the speaker.
The Prime Minister's signal came from there——
The viewing platform at the top of the minaret.
I sense Count Dooku.
I sense a trap. next move?
Start the trap.
R2, go back. I need you to stay on board.

What's the matter, Captain?
Two Jedi Knights landed on the main hangar. We are following them.
Just as Count Dooku expected.

Put down your weapons. I say let them go.
Roger. Roger, Roger.
Roger, Roger.
Those were the Jedi, yes.
Did you hit the stop button? no, is it?
- No - Well, there's more than one way to get out of here.
We don't want to go out.
We want to act. R2, activate elevator 31174.
Come in, R2. what is that?
R2, have you received it?
R2, activate elevator number...
31174。
go back to work. That's nothing.
Activate elevator 31174.
R2, we-
Always on the move.
R2, open the communication link.
R2, can you hear me?
R2？
Wow!
R2！R2！
stop. stop. R2, we need to go up.
Hands up, Jedi Knight.
R2, have you received it?
R2, did you hear that? R2, we need to go up, not down.
Hey you!
I'm feeling better now.
You stupid little astrobot.
It's you.
my eyes! my eyes!
What was that doing just now? Well, R2 has-
No loose wire jokes. Did I say something?
He is trying. I didn't say anything.
headmaster. Are you all right?
Count Dooku.
Let's do it together this time. I'm about to say that.
receive help. You are no match for him. He is the Sith Lord.
Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
Your sword please.
We don't want to mess things up in front of the prime minister.
You can't escape this time, Dooku.
I've been looking forward to this.
I have doubled my strength since we last met, Count.
OK Double the pride, double the fall.
get-
I feel the fear deep within you, Skywalker.
You have hatred. You have anger.
But you don't use them.
Very good, Anakin. OK
kill him.
Kill him now.
I shouldn't.
do it.
You are doing well, Anakin.
He is too dangerous to live.
Yes, but he is an unarmed prisoner.
I shouldn't have done that. This is not the way of the Jedi.
This is very natural. He cut off your arm, and you want revenge.
It's not the first time, Anakin.
Remember when you told me about your mother and the Sandman?
Now we have to get out before more security robots arrive.
Anakin, time is running out.
We must get off this ship before it's too late.
- He seems to be fine. - Leave him, or we'll never make it.
His fate will be the same as ours.
Ready to attack!
All batteries, fire! fire!
The elevator is broken.
R2, start elevator 3224.
- Reverse stabilizer. - Reverse stabilizer.
magnetization! magnetization!
Ignite the emergency booster engine.
We're leveling, sir.
simple. We have a situation here.
What did I miss? hold on.
- what is that? - oops.
R2. R2, close the elevator.
It's too late. Jump!
Let's see if we can find something still flyable in the hangar.
R2, come down.
R2, have you received it?
General, we've found the Jedi.
They're in hallway 328. Activate the ray shield.
Ray shield.
Wait a moment. How did this happen?
We are smarter than that. Obviously not.
I say patience. patience?
Yes. R2 will come later,
And then... he'll unleash the ray shield.
look? no problem.
Do not move.
Do you have a "B" plan?
Yes. negotiator.
General Kenobi. We have been waiting for you.
excuse me.
It's not much of a rescue. You're welcome.
and-
Anakin Skywalker.
I would have thought that someone as famous as you would be... a little older.
General Grievous. You are shorter than I thought.
Jedi scum.
We have work to do, Anakin. Try not to upset him.
Your lightsaber would be a great addition to my collection.
Not this time. And this time, you can't escape.
R2。
Smash them all!
Let them suffer!
Come. Now!
Stay at your station! Wow!
catch him! catch him!
running!
Just ignore them. Keep the spaceship on track. Yes, sir.
You lost, General Kenobi.
leave here! running!
It's time to abandon ship.
All escape pods are activated.
serious. Can you drive a cruiser like this?
You mean, do I know how to land the rest of this thing? Excellent?
Well, in this case, I'd say the ability to drive this thing is irrelevant.
fasten your seatbelt.
Open all hatches. Extend all flaps and trailing fins.
We lost something.
Don't worry. We're still flying half the ship.
Now we're really picking up the pace.
Eight plus sixty.
We are in the atmosphere. grab that. Let's keep it level.
stable.
Easy, R2.
5000. Fire left and right.
- we'll take you in- receive
- Runway, straight ahead. - It's too hot for us.
Another happy landing.
- Are you coming, master? - No, I'm not brave enough for politics.
I have to report to the council.
Also, someone needs to be the poster boy.
hold on. The whole operation is your idea.
Let's not forget, Anakin, that you saved me from the buzzbots.
You killed Count Dooku and saved the Chancellor,
Behind my back unconscious.
All because of your training.
Anakin, let's be fair. Today you are a hero,
You deserve a good day with politicians.
OK But you owe me one, not the 10th time to save your skin.
Ninth time. That sale on Cato Neimoidia doesn't count.
Briefing meeting.
Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?
Yes. Thank you for your two Jedi.
They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous escaped again.
General Grievous will, as always, run and hide. He is a coward.
But with the death of Count Dooku, he became the leader of the droid army.
I guarantee you that as long as Grievous is alive, the Senate will vote to continue the war.
Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our top priority.
watch it. excuse me.
Come on, R2. The Republic has nothing but praise for you.
Thank you, Senator Organa.
Well, it can't be that bad.
Now I agree with you.
In fact, I can make adjustments myself.
But the fighting will continue until General Grievous becomes a spare.
Well, I'll do my best in the Senate.
excuse me. certainly.
Anakin.
I miss you, Padmé.
Rumor has it that you were killed.
I am fine.
It feels like we've been apart forever.
If the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped, it might have been.
I don't think they're going to bring us back from the Rim siege.
wait. not here. Yes, here.
I- I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.
Anakin, don't say that.
Are you all right? You are shaking.
How is this going?
A wonderful thing happened.
Annie, I'm pregnant.
That is-
Well, won - great.
What are we going to do?
We have nothing to worry about now. OK?
This is a happy moment.
The happiest moment of my life.
♪♪
Yes, Lord Sidious?
General Grievous,
I suggest you transfer the Separatist leader to Mustafar.
It will be done, my lord.
The war is coming to an end, General.
But without Count Dooku—
His death was a necessary loss.
Soon I'll have a new apprentice—
A younger and stronger.
Annie, I want our baby to go back to Naboo's house.
We can go to lake country that no one knows,
Where we can be safe.
I can go to tidy up the baby's room earlier.
I know the perfect place. Right next to the garden.
you are so Beautiful.
Just because I love it so much.
No.
No, it's because I love you so much.
So love blinded you?
Well, that's not exactly what I meant.
But it might be true.
Anakin, help me!
What's bothering you?
there is nothing.
I remember when I gave this to you.
How long will it take us to be honest with each other?
It's a dream.
bad?
Like the ones I used to do to my mother,
Just before she died.
and?
This is about you.
tell me.
It was just a dream.
You die in childbirth.
Where is the baby?
I have no idea.
It was just a dream.
I will not let this be true.
This baby will change our lives.
I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate.
If the committee finds you're the father, you'll be expelled—
I- I know. I know.
Do you think Obi-Wan can help us?
We don't need his help.
Our children are a blessing.
Premonition? premonition.
You have these visions -
They are painful, very painful.
die.
Are you talking about yourself, or someone you know?
someone.
close to you?
Yes.
Anakin, be careful when sensing the future.
Fear of loss is the path to the dark side.
I will not let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
Death is a natural part of life.
Rejoice in those around you transformed into the Force.
Mourn them, don't. Miss them, don't.
Attachment leads to jealousy.
That is the shadow of greed.
Master Yoda, what should I do?
Train yourself to let go...
Everything you are afraid of losing.
You missed the coverage of the outer ring siege.
sorry. I was stopped.
I have no excuses. In short, they went well.
Saleucami has fallen and Master Vos has transferred his forces to Boz Pity.
What's wrong?
The Senate is expected to...
Vote today for more executive powers to the chancellor.
Well, it can only mean less thinking and more action. Isn't that bad?
This will make it easier for us to end this war.
Watch out for your friend Palpatine.
Beware of what?
He has asked you to attend. what for?
He won't say it. He didn't notify the council?
It's very unusual, isn't it? None of this is unusual.
This makes me uneasy.
I hope you believe me, Anakin.
certainly.
I need your help, son.
what do you mean?
I depend on you. for what? I do not understand.
Be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic.
Anakin,
I appoint you as my personal representative to the Jedi Council.
I? Grandmaster?
I'm at a loss, sir.
But the council elects its own members. They will never accept this.
I think they will. They need you.
more than you know.
The committee will not allow this appointment lightly.
This move by Chancellor Palpatine is disturbing.
I see.
You are a member of this council, but we do not grant you the status of a master.
What?
how can you do this This is outrageous.
It's not fair.
How can you not be the master when you are on the council?
Sit down, young Skywalker.
Forgive me, Master.
We surveyed all the systems of the Republic,
But no trace of General Grievous was found.
Hidden in the periphery is Grievous.
Peripheral systems that you have to clean up.
We don't have many ships to spare.
How about a robot attack on a Wookiee?
It is critical that we send an strike team there immediately.
He is right. This is a system we cannot afford to lose.
Go I will.
I have a great relationship with the Wookiees.
That's set. Yoda will lead a battalion of clones...
to enhance Wookiees on Kashyyyk.
May the force be with us.
What kind of nonsense is this?
Put me in council instead of making me master?
This has never been done in the history of the Jedi. This is insulting.
Calm down, Anakin. You have been bestowed with great honor.
To be in Parliament at your age has never happened before.
The truth is you are too close to the prime minister.
The Council didn't like his meddling in Jedi affairs.
I swear to you, I didn't ask to be on the committee. But that's what you want.
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
This has nothing to do with it.
The only reason the council approved your appointment...
It is because the principal trusts you.
and? Anakin, I'm on your side.
I don't want to put you in this situation. what's the situation?
The committee wants you to report all the Chancellor's dealings.
They want to know what he's doing.
They want me to spy on the Prime Minister?
But that is treason. We're at war, Anakin.
Why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were meeting?
This task is not documented.
The Chancellor is not a bad guy, Obi-Wan.
He and I became friends. He has been taking care of me since I came here.
That's why you must help us.
Anakin, our allegiance is to the Senate, not to the leader of the Senate,
He managed to stay in office long after his term expired.
The Senate asked him to stay longer.
Yes, but use your senses, Anakin. Something is wrong.
You want me to do something that violates the Jedi code,
Against the Republic, against mentors and friends.
That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking me this?
The council is asking you.
Anakin did not take up his new assignment with enthusiasm.
Putting them together is dangerous.
I don't think the boy can handle it.
I don't trust him.
With all due respect, master, isn't he the chosen one?
Isn't he out to destroy the Sith and balance the Force?
So the prophecy says.
A prophecy that could be misinterpreted.
He will not let me down.
He never has.
I hope you are right.
Sometimes I wonder what happened to the Jedi Order.
I think this war is destroying the principles of the republic.
Did it ever occur to you that we might be on the wrong side?
what do you mean?
What if we think the democracy we serve no longer exists,
The Republic has become the evil we've been working so hard to destroy?
I do not believe.
You sound like a separatist.
This war represents a failure to listen.
Now you are closer to the Prime Minister than anyone.
Ask him to stop fighting and resume diplomacy.
Don't make me do that.
A motion is filed in the Senate, a place for such requests.
- what is it? - there is nothing.
Do not do this. Don't shut me out. let me help you.
hold me.
Just like you did at Naboo's lake.
A long time ago, when there was nothing but our love.
No politics, no conspiracy, no war.

- You want to see me, Speaker. - Yes, Anakin. come closer.
I have good news.
Our clone intelligence unit has discovered the location of General Grievous.
He hid in the Utapau system.
finally.
We'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.
I would worry about the collective wisdom of the council...
If it does not choose you to perform this task.
You are by far the best option.
sit down.
leave us.
♪♪
Anakin,
You know I can't rely on the Jedi Council.
If they didn't include you in their plot, they soon will.
I'm not sure I understand.
You must have sensed my doubts.
The Jedi Council wants to take control of the Republic.
They are going to betray me.
I don't think so - Anakin.
Search your feelings.
you know, don't you?
I know they don't trust you. Or the Senate.
Or a republic, or a democracy, for that matter.
I have to admit, my trust in them has been shaken.
Why?
they want you to do something...
It makes you feel dishonest, doesn't it?
They made you spy on me, didn't they?
I don't -
I do not know what to say.
Remember to go back to your earlier teachings.
All who gain power are afraid of losing it.
Even Jedi Knights. Jedi Knights are always good at using their powers.
Good point, Anakin.
Sith and Jedi are similar in almost every way,
Including their quest for greater power.
Sith rely on their zeal for power.
They think inwardly - only for themselves.
And the Jedi didn't?
Jedi Knights are selfless. They only care about other people.
Have you heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
No, I don't think so.
This is not the story a Jedi will tell you.
It's a Sith legend.
Darth Plagueis...
Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise,
He can use the force to affect midi-plasma...
Create... life.
He knows the dark side so well,
He can even keep people he cares about...
from death.
He actually... can save people from death?
The dark side of the Force is the gateway to many abilities...
Some consider it unnatural.
He—what happened to him?
he became so powerful,
The only thing he's afraid of is...
lose his power.
Of course, he eventually did.
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew.
Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.
It's ironic.
He can save others from death,
But not himself.
Is it possible to learn this power?
Not from the Jedi.
All red units are here!
Palpatine thought General Grievous was in Utapau?
Part of the message was intercepted in the diplomatic packet...
Chairman from Utapau.
We must act on this.
Capturing General Grievous would end the war.
We should proceed quickly and decisively.
The chancellor has asked ... for me to lead the campaign.
Council will decide for itself who goes,
Not the prime minister.
A master with more experience is needed.
I agree. It's time for Master Kenobi to go.
- I agree. - Yes.
Yes.
very good. Council adjourns.
The robots have activated their main generators.
Then now is the time, Commander. Yes, sir.
TOLL!
Go to cover!
You need me in this matter, master. I agree.
However, the result may just be a wild banta chase. master.
I have let you down. I don't really appreciate your training.
I was so arrogant, I apologize.
I am very frustrated with the council.
Anakin, you are strong and wise, and I am so proud of you.
I have trained you since childhood.
I've taught you everything I know.
And you've become a far greater Jedi than I ever hoped to be.
But please be patient, Anakin.
Before long, the Council will make you a Jedi Master.
Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.
Goodbye, old friend. May the Force be with you.
Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated in this small continent.

He was here this morning.

He is worried about you.
He said you were under a lot of pressure.

They entrust their lives to you.

I'm not the Jedi I'm supposed to be.

Is that something that bothers you?
I won't lose you, Padmé.
I will not die in childbirth, Annie.
I promise you. No, I assure you.
Hello, young Jedi.
What brought you to our remote sanctuary?
Unfortunately, war.
There is no war here - unless you bring it.
I need some fuel with your permission...
And use your city as my base while I search the nearby galaxy for General Grievous.
He's here. We are being held hostage.
They are watching us. I see.
On the tenth floor, thousands of combat robots.
Tell your people to take refuge.
If you have fighters, now is the time.
Bring the fighter back to the ship. Tell Cody I'm connected.
Did he bring in extra fighters? He didn't say.
It won't be long before the army of the Republic will be tracking us down.
I'm taking you to the Mustafar system on the outer rim.
It is a volcanic planet.
You'll be safe there. safe?
snort! Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grasp, General.
Without Count Dooku, I doubt your ability to keep us safe.

Hey!
Cover that corner.
Master Windu, may I interrupt?
General Kenobi has contacted General Grievous,
We're already on the offensive.
Thank you, Commander.
Anakin, take this report to the Chancellor.
His reaction will give us an idea of ​​his intentions.
Yes Master.
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.
The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.
If he does not relinquish his emergency powers after Grievous is destroyed,
Then he should be removed from office.
The Jedi Council will have to take control of the Senate...
to ensure a peaceful transition.
This line of thought will take us to a dark place.
We must be very careful.
headmaster.
We've just received a report from Master Kenobi.
He had contact with General Grievous.
We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
I should be with him.
see council...
It seems that your talents are not fully appreciated.
Don't you wonder why they didn't make you a Jedi Master?
I wish I knew.
I feel more and more...
I was excluded from the council.
I know there are some things they didn't tell me about the Force.
They don't trust you, Anakin.
They see your future.
They know your power is too great to control.
You must break through the fog of lies that the Jedi Knights have created around you.
Let me help you understand the subtleties of the Force.
How do you know the ways of the Force?
My mentor taught me all about the Force.
Even the nature of the dark side.
Do you know the dark side?
Anakin,
If one were to understand this great mystery,
One must study all its aspects,
Not just a narrow view of Jedi dogma.
If you want to be a complete and wise leader,
You have to look at the Force in the bigger picture.
Be careful Jedi, Anakin.
Only through me...
Can you gain power greater than any Jedi?
Learn to understand the dark side of the Force,
And you will be able to save your wife...
from certain death.
What did you say?
Use my knowledge. I beg you.
You are the Sith Lord.
I know what bothers you. listen to me.
Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council.
Ever since I've known you, you've been looking for a life...
Larger than normal Jedi.

I know you will.
I can feel your anger.

I'm turning you over to the Jedi Council. certainly. you should.
But you're not sure about their intentions, are you?
I will soon discover the truth of all this.
You are very wise, Anakin.
Know the power of the dark side.
Save Padmé's power.
ah!
So uncivilized.
Master Windu, I must speak to you.
Skywalker, we just received word that Obi-Wan destroyed General Grievous.
We are working to ensure that the Chancellor returns emergency powers to the Senate.
He will not give up his power. I just learned a terrible truth.
I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
Lord of the Sith?
Yes. The man we've been looking for.
How do you know this? He knows the ways of the Force.
He was trained to use the dark side.
are you sure? Absolutely.
Then our worst fears happened.
We must act fast if the Jedi Order is to survive.
Young master, the prime minister is so powerful.
If you're going to arrest him, you need my help.
For your own good, stay away from this.
I sense your confusion, young Skywalker.
There are many fears that can cloud your judgment.
I have to go, Master. No.
If what you tell me is true,
You will earn my trust.
But for now, stay here.
Wait for us back in the conference hall.
Yes Master.

Do what must be done, Lord Vader.
Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.
Only in this way can you be strong enough against the dark side...
Save Padmé.
What about the other Jedi all over the galaxy?
Their betrayal will be dealt with.
After you have killed all the Jedi in the temple,
Go to the Mustafar system.
Kill Viceroy Gunray...
and other separatist leaders.
Sith will rule the galaxy once again!
and...
We will have...peace.
Sergeant, this way!
hurry! follow them!
All red units, let's move!

Commander, contact your unit.
Tell them to move to a higher level.
Very good sir.
By the way, I think you will need this.
Thank you, Cody. Now let's move on. We have a battle to win here.
Hey! Yes, sir.
Commander Cody,
The time has come.

Senator Organa. My clone troopers turned on me. I need help.
We just rescued Master Yoda.
It appears that such ambushes are everywhere.
We are sending you our coordinates.
Hush! Don't be so loud.
Are you all right? I heard the Jedi Temple was attacked.
You can see the smoke from here. I am fine. I am fine.
I'm here to see if you and the baby are safe. what happened?
The Jedi tried to overthrow the Republic.
I can not believe it.
I witnessed Master Windu's attempted assassination of the Chancellor.
Anakin. What are you going to do?
I will not betray the Republic.
My loyalty lies with the Speaker...
And the Senate and you.
What about Obi-Wan?
I have no idea.
Many Jedi were killed.
We can only hope he remains loyal to the prime minister.
Anakin, I'm afraid.
Have faith, my love.
Everything will be back to normal soon.
The principal gave me a very important mission.
Separatists gather in the Mustafar system.
I'm going there to end this war.

Things will be different. I promise.
Please wait for me.
Well, he's stressed out, R2.
Take care, my little friend.
Miss, is there anything I can do?
No thank you, 3 PO.
I—I feel so helpless.
How many other Jedi survived?
No one has heard of us.
I saw thousands of troops attacking the Jedi Temple.
That's why I went to Yoda.
Do we have any connection from the temple?
We've received a coded retreat message.
It calls for all Jedi to return to the Temple.
It says the war is over. Well, we have to go back.
If there are stragglers, they will fall into the trap and die.
It is recommended to disassemble the encoded signal, how about you?
Yes Master. The stakes are high.
I agree.
A little more knowledge might light our way.
As you promised, the plan is complete, my lord.
You are doing well, Governor.
When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives,
He will take care of you.
Sir, we have received a message from the principal's office.
send it over. Yes, sir.
Senator Organa, the Supreme Chancellor requests your presence...
in a special session of Congress.
- I will be there. - He will wait for you.
- Might be a trap. - I do not think so.
The Chancellor will not be able to control thousands of galaxies...
Did not keep the Senate intact.
If there is a special session of Congress,
We will have easier access to the Jedi Temple.
R2, stay on board.
Welcome, Lord Vader. we have been waiting for you
The Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.
What happened? The principal has been elaborating...
In a plot by the Jedi to overthrow the Senate.
The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated.
Not even the cubs survived.
Not killed by clones...

To bring peace to the Empire.
I can't watch anymore.
We must destroy the Sith.

I will not kill Anakin.
You are not strong enough to fight this Lord Sidious.

Young Skywalker is warped by the dark side.
The boy you trained, he's gone.
Consumed by Darth Vader.
I don't know where the emperor sent him.
I don't know where to look.
Use your senses, Obi-Wan, and you'll find him.
When was the last time you saw him?
yesterday. Do you know where he is now?
No.

He is in grave danger. From Sith?

Anakin had turned to the dark side.

Not Anakin. he can not.
He was deceived by lies. We are all.
It seems that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is running everything behind the scenes, including the war.
Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for.
After Count Dooku died, Anakin became his new apprentice.
I do not believe you.
I can not.
Padmé,
I must find him.
You're going to kill him, aren't you?
He has become a very big threat.
I can not.
Anakin is the father, isn't he?
I'm very sorry.
Milady, let me go with you.
No danger. The battle is over. It's personal.
As you wish, ma'am, but I vehemently disagree.
I'll be all right, Captain. This is something I have to do myself.
Also, 3PO will take care of me.
Honey.

I think I'm starting to get the hang of the flying business.
The Separatists have been dealt with, my master.
That's it.
You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy.
Send messages to Trade Federation ships.
All robot cells must be switched off immediately.
Very well, my master.
I see your boat.

Obi-Wan told me some terrible things.

He said you have turned to the dark side.

Obi-Wan wants you to turn against me.
He cares about us. us?

He wants to help you.
Anakin, all I want is your love.
Love can't save you, Padmé.
Only my new ability can do this. What's the fare?
You are a good person. Do not do this.
I won't lose you like I lost my mother.

Leave everything else behind while we still can. don't you understand
We don't have to run away anymore.

Together, you and I can rule the galaxy,
Make things the way we want them to be.
I don't believe what I'm hearing.
Obi-Wan was right. you've changed.
I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan.
The Jedi turned against me. Don't fight me.
I don't know you anymore.

You are on a path that I cannot follow.
Because of Obi-Wan?

No.
You are with him! You brought him here to kill me.

You turned her against me!
You did it yourself.
You will not take her away from me!
Your anger and your thirst for power have done it.
You have let this dark lord warp your mind until now—
Until now, you have become what you swore to destroy.
Don't teach me, Obi-Wan.
I see through the lies of the Jedi Knights.
I'm not afraid of the dark side like you are.
I bring peace,
liberty, justice...

Your new empire?
Don't make me kill you.
