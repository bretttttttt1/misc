156. Copyright © 2010
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.600
I see. I will teach you to walk.

157. Copyright © 2010
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.840
Look, Abu.

158. Copyright © 2010
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.040
You don’t see that every day
a horse with two hind ends.

159. Copyright © 2010
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26.560
Animal!

160. Copyright © 2010
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.480
You're a worthless street rat.

161. Copyright © 2010
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.720
You were born a street rat, .
you died like a street rat

162. Copyright © 2010
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.800 pacha
and only fleas cry for you.

163. Copyright © 2010
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.680
I don't value anything.

164. Copyright © 2010
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.880
And I don’t have fleas.

165. Copyright © 2010
00:10:45.040 -->
Come on, Abu.
Let’s go home.

166. Copyright © 2010
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,120
#Riffraff, caturotta#.

167. Copyright © 2010
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.440
#i didn't buy this#

168. Copyright © 2010
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.120 pacha
#They can watch more closely#

169. Copyright © 2010
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.200 pacha
#could they take care of that poor guy#

170. Copyright © 2010
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.920
#Not my father#

171. Copyright © 2010
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.240
#They could have found out#

172. Copyright © 2010
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.920
#There's more to come#

173. Copyright © 2010
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,000
#For Me#

174. Copyright © 2010
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.880
One day, Abu,
things change.

175. Copyright © 2010
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.800 hours
We are rich, we live in a palace,

176. Copyright © 2010
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,000
and I have never had any problems.

177. Copyright © 2010
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.200 pacha
I have never been so upset.

178. Copyright © 2010
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.920
Oh Prince Ahmed .
You wouldn’t leave that early, would you?

179. Copyright © 2010
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.040
Good luck marrying her.

180. Copyright © 2010
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.600 hours
Oh yeah, yeah! Jasmine was like that.

181. Copyright © 2010
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.800
Jasmine is alright!

182. Copyright © 2010
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.720
Jasmine is alright!

183. Copyright © 2010
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.720
- Jasmine!

184. Copyright © 2010
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.840
That's cool, Rajah.

185. Copyright © 2010
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.040
That’s why Prince Ahmed did it
fighting

186. Copyright © 2010
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,520
oh dad

187. Copyright © 2010
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.320 pacha
Rajah continued to play with him.
Isn't that true, Rajah?

188. Copyright © 2010
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.520
you are just kidding
and isthapt'ata

189. Copyright © 2010
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.240
Self-conscious Prince Ahmed,
Isn't that right ?

190. Copyright © 2010
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.360
Honey, don’t disagree
every suitor who comes calling.

191. Copyright © 2010
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.120
The law says
you marry a prince…

192. Copyright © 2010
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.080
before the next birthday.

193. Copyright © 2010
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30.560
The law is not good enough.

194. Copyright © 2010
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.800 hours
There are only three days left.

195. Copyright © 2010
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.360
Sir, I hate to be forced to do that.

196. Copyright © 2010
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.600 hours
If I get married, .
I want it to be out of love.

197. Copyright © 2010
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.760
Jasmine is the.

198. Copyright © 2010
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.880
it is not this rule.

199. Copyright © 2010
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.280
I won't be here forever,
suma i...

200 square feet
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.880
I want to know without a doubt
you will be taken care of.

201. Copyright © 2010
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.280
Anticipated slowly.

202. Copyright © 2010
00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.960
Try to understand.

203. Copyright © 2013
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.080
I never did anything on my own.
I never had any real friends.

204. Copyright © 2010
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.800
Except you, Rajah.

205. Copyright © 2010
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.200
I’ve never been there
outside the palace walls.

206. Copyright © 2010
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.640
But Jasmine, you are a princess.

207. Copyright © 2010
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.520
So maybe he doesn't want to
to be more of a princess.

208. Copyright © 2010
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.320
Oooh! naya naya...

209. Copyright © 2010
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.360
Allah has forbidden you to do so
must have daughters.

210. Copyright © 2010
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.840
Mmm?

211. Copyright © 2011
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.360
I don’t know where he got it.

212. Copyright © 2012
00:13:36.440 -->
His mother was not such a choice.

213. Copyright © 2013
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.760
I see! Ah, Jafar .

214. Copyright © 2014
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.240
My most trusted adviser.

215. Copyright © 2015
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.040
I want your knowledge.

216. Copyright © 2016
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51.760
Life is meant to serve you, sir.

217. Copyright © 2010
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.440
It’s the business of suitors.

218. Copyright © 2010
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.920
Jasmine refused
choose your husband.

219. Copyright © 2010
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.880
- I'm at the end of my nerves.
- Oh, they were! Finish the rope!

220 rule of law
00:13:58.920 -->
I see!

221. Copyright © 2010
00:14:01.920 -->
A biscuit, good Polly.

222. Copyright © 2010
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.400 hours
His majesty is real
think with gentle animals.

223. Copyright © 2010
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.960
NOW,
maybe i can figure out the solution

224. Copyright © 2010
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.080
this difficult problem.

225. Copyright © 2010
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.680
If anyone can help, you will.

226. Copyright © 2010
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.680
However, this may require some management
the mystic blue diamond .

227. Copyright © 2010
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.520
I see. Oh my ring?

228. Copyright © 2010
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.880
But it has been in the family for many years.

229. Copyright © 2010
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.040
We need to find out
the princess is a suitor.

230. Copyright © 2010
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32.840
Don't worry.

231. Copyright © 2010
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.440
Everything will be fine.

232. Copyright © 2010
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.960
Everything will be fine.

233. Copyright © 2010
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.040
Diamond was the name.

234. Copyright © 2010
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43.520
Here, in Jafar.

235. Copyright © 2010
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.920
Everything you need is well equipped.

236. Copyright © 2010
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.600
You are very kind, sir.

237. Copyright © 2010
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.160
Now run and play
with your little toys, isn't it?

238. Copyright © 2010
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.640
If. It’s going to be pretty cool.

239. Copyright © 2010
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.760
Can't take it anymore !

240. Copyright © 2010
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.600 pacha
I would have to choke once more
those moldy, disgusting cookies…

241. Copyright © 2010
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.800 pacha
Boom! I'm fighting!

242. Copyright © 2010
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.200
Relax, Lake.

243. Copyright © 2010
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.480
Then I held his head.
I'm fighting!

244. Copyright © 2010
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.240
Soon I will be the Sultan,
not this stupid idiot.

245. Copyright © 2010
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.480
And then stuffed with cookies
it was crazy.

246. Copyright © 2010
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,000
¡Haha!

247. Copyright © 2010
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.240
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

248. Copyright © 2010
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.320
But I can’t stay here
and my life must be lived for me.

249. Copyright © 2010
00:15:47.320 -->
I will miss you.

250. Copyright © 2010
00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.080
Animal Animal.

251. Copyright © 2010
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.040
Good morning, Abu. Go.

252. Copyright © 2010
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.800
Try it out. The sewing machines
dances, songs.

253. Copyright © 2010
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.040
In this case, remove your foot.

254. Copyright © 2010
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Why do you.

255. Copyright © 2010
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.800
To get out of here, .
you damn dirty monkey!

256. Copyright © 2010
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.880
Animal Animal.

257. Copyright © 2010
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.120
They also look at things.

258. Copyright © 2010
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.320
Breakfast will be served.

259. Copyright © 2010
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.880
Good woman, buy a pot.

260. Copyright © 2010
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.200
There could be no finer dish made of brass or silver.

261. Copyright © 2010
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.640
Sugar cubes .
Sweet dates and figs.

262. Copyright © 2010
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.800
Sweet dates and pistachios.

263. Copyright © 2010
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.600
Does a woman need a necklace?

264. Copyright © 2010
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.120
A beautiful necklace for a beautiful woman.

265. Copyright © 2010
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.520
Fresh challwa!

266. Copyright © 2010
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.000
We caught them, you bought them!

267. Copyright © 2010
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.680
Oh no, I don't. I don't believe it.

268. Copyright © 2010
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.080
I see!

269. Copyright © 2010
00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.960
P'ampachawi.

270. Copyright © 2010
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.880
I’m really, really sorry.

271. Copyright © 2010
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.640
Wow.

272. Copyright © 2010
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.560
Oh no, I don't.

273. Copyright © 2010
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.600
Ask everyone. How do I live?

274. Copyright © 2010
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.920
Oh, you must be hungry.

275. Copyright © 2010
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.560
Here’s the existing one.

276. Copyright © 2010
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.680
You better pay for it .

277. Copyright © 2010
00:17:27.720 -->
Is he the only one?

278. Copyright © 2010
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.880
No one steals the basket.

279. Copyright © 2010
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.600 hours
Oh, I’m sorry, sir.
I don't have the money.

280. Copyright © 2010
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.040
- The powers!
- Amp sum.

281. Copyright © 2010
00:17:35.120 -->
If you let me go to the palace,
I can find the Sultan.

282. Copyright © 2010
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.160
you know what
is there a penalty for stealing?

283. Copyright © 2010
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.880
No! I’m not thankful!

284. Copyright © 2010
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.840
Thank you, sir.
I am so glad you found it.

285. Copyright © 2010
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.840
I'm looking for you everywhere.

286. Copyright © 2010
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.920
- Art lurtä?
- Play a game.

287. Copyright © 2010
00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.240
Do you know this girl?

288. Copyright © 2010
00:17:52.320 -->
But unfortunately, yes. She’s my sister.

289. Copyright © 2010
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.400
He's a little crazy.

290. Copyright © 2010
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.160
He said he knew the Sultan.

291. Copyright © 2010
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.960
He thinks the monkey is Sultan.

292. Copyright © 2010
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.360
O wise Sultan, how can I serve you?

293. Copyright © 2010
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,600
Sad, isn't it?

294. Copyright © 2010
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.600
But there is no problem.

295. Copyright © 2010
00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.400
Now come on, sister.
It’s time to go to the doctor.

296. Copyright © 2010
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.840
Good morning, Doctor.
How is this going to happen?

297. Copyright © 2010
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.400
- No, I don't know. Don’t be afraid.
"Come on, Sultan.

298. Copyright © 2010
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.680
Eh. Kuna?

299. Copyright © 2010
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.040
Come back here, little thieves!

300 square feet
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.680
With all due respect,
Your decay, .

301. Copyright © 2010
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.200
we can’t just wait
for the right wind?

302. Copyright © 2010
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.160
Breathe save me, Lake. More immediately.

303. Copyright © 2013
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.800
Yes, this is my father's prayer.

304. Copyright © 2010
00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.160
No, the weather is slow.

305. Copyright © 2010
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.200
Show it to me
whoever enters the hole.

306. Copyright © 2010
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.480
Jesus! Jesus!

307. Copyright © 2010
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.840
Here’s the existing one.

308. Copyright © 2010
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.200
My diamond is hard.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.680
He is. It’s called a clown
Did they wait for it?

310. Copyright © 2010
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.800
Let the guards get on with it
an invitation to the palace, okay?

311. Copyright © 2011
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.360
Swell.

312. Copyright © 2012

I want to thank you guys

00:19:32.520 -->
Forget about it.

So this is your first time
market, right?

316. Copyright © 2016
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.160
Is it that obvious?

317. Copyright © 2017
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.160
Well, you're still famous.

318. Copyright © 2010
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.400
I mean, as if you didn’t know
how Agrabah can fail .

319. Copyright © 2010
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.960
Hmmm, I'm a bit of a student.

Do you live here?

326. Copyright © 2010

If. I'm with Abumpiki.
Come, go as you please.

327. Copyright © 2010
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.120
It looks amazing.

328. Copyright © 2010
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.280
Well, not so much, .
but it has a broad vision.

329. Copyright © 2010
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.040
Wow. The palace is overlooked
Interesting, isn’t it?

330 command
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh, that’s funny.

331. Copyright © 2010
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.920
I wondered what it would be like
it’s like I lived there

332. Copyright © 2010
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.360
and there are slaves and servants.

333. Copyright © 2010
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.960
Oh, of course. People are reporting
where to go, how to dress.

334. Copyright © 2010
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.400 hours
Much better than this.

335. Copyright © 2010
00:20:34.440 -->
You're always looking for food
and dodging guards.

336. Copyright © 2010
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.360
You are not free
you have to choose for yourself.

337. Copyright © 2010
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.920 pacha
- Sometimes it's.

338. Copyright © 2010
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.160
...ansa.

339. Copyright © 2010
00:20:47.080 -->
So where did you come from?

340. Copyright © 2010
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.840
What is the value of this?

341. Copyright © 2010
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.400
I was running away
and I'm not going back.

342. Copyright © 2010
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.960
Really. How can it be so?

343. Copyright © 2010
00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.640
Why do you.

344. Copyright © 2010
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.800
My father inspires me

345. Copyright © 2010
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.560 pacha
It’s… terrible.

348. Copyright © 2010
00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.680
Abu says that.

351. Copyright © 2010
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.880
Ja Abu

352. Copyright © 2010
00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.320
So he wants to be
what he could do to help.

353. Copyright © 2010
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Oh no, I don't.

354. Copyright © 2010
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.040
Mmm.

355. Copyright © 2010

Call him the best.

356. Copyright © 2010
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.040 hours
That's where you are.

357. Copyright © 2010
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.400 hours
"They're following me!" You?
- My father sent them to.

358. Copyright © 2010
00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.680
"Can you trust me?"
- Is there?

359. Copyright © 2010
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.640
"Can you trust me?"
- Joo...

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.520
Run! Go! Get out of here!

363. Copyright © 2010

Take this thing away from me!

364. Copyright © 2010

Therefore,
at the command of the princess.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.040
Princess Jasmine.

369. Copyright © 2010

- Nice?

370. Copyright © 2010
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.800
What are you doing outside the palace?
And this street rat.

371. Copyright © 2010
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.520
It is not your problem.
Just do as I say. Let him go, please.

- You need to talk to him.
- Believe me, I'm sorry.

374. Copyright © 2010
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.280
Jafar is the one?

375. Copyright © 2010
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.080
Oh princess.

376. Copyright © 2010
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.480
So it’s a good idea! Jafar, I'm stuck.

377. Copyright © 2010
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.680
How can I help you out?

378. Copyright © 2010
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.960
The guards took only the boy

379. Copyright © 2010
00:22:51.040 -->
Your father condemned me
Peace in Agrabah.

380. Copyright © 2010
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.600
- The guy is a bad guy.
- What's his fault?

381. Copyright © 2010
00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.960
You can’t breathe, Jafar.

382. Copyright © 2010
00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.480
Why kidnap the princess,
Of course.

383. Copyright © 2010
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.800
You're.
Ah! That is annoying!

384. Copyright © 2010
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.440
He was not kidnapped.
I was running away.

385. Copyright © 2010
00:23:07.520 -->
Ohhh.

386. Copyright © 2010
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.520
Oh, how wonderful.
I'd know...

387. Copyright © 2010
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.760
What do you mean?

388. Copyright © 2010
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.280
Oh, the boy’s judgment
it is almost complete.

389. Copyright © 2010
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.760
What is the aruchjasa?

390. Copyright © 2010
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.720
Soul.

391. Copyright © 2010
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.680
- With the fight.
- No.

392. Copyright © 2010
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.560
I am so sorry, princess.

How are you?

394. Copyright © 2010
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.640
So how did that happen?

395. Copyright © 2010
00:23:45.720 -->
I think he took it well.

396. Copyright © 2010
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,160
It's all my fault, Rajah.

397. Copyright © 2010
00:24:06.720 -->
- I don't even know his name.

398. Copyright © 2010
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.720
She was a princess.

399. Copyright © 2010
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.040
I don't believe it.

400 square feet
00:24:32.120 -->
I must have watched it
so foolish for him.

401. Copyright © 2010
00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.720
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin is great!

402. Copyright © 2010
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.080
Ask everyone!

403. Copyright © 2013
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.760 hours
Ashes. Akana.

404. Copyright © 2010
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.920
Come on, help us out of here.

405. Copyright © 2005
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.200
Hey, he was in trouble.
Ah, he’s good enough.

406. Copyright © 2010
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.080
Jïsa jïsa jïsa

407. Copyright © 2010
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.160
Don't worry.
I will never see him again.

408. Copyright © 2010
00:24:59.240 -->
I’m a street rat, remember?
And there is a rule.

409. Copyright © 2009
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.600 hours
She must marry the prince.

410. Copyright © 2010
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.840
- She deserves a prince.
- Yes Yes!

411. Copyright © 2011
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.880
I'm a slow mover.

412. Copyright © 2013
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.760
You’re just a fool
you leave me alone baby

413. Copyright © 2013
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.040
Who are you?

414. Copyright © 2014
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.400
A humble prisoner like you.

415. Copyright © 2015
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.280
But together,
perhaps more than that.

416. Copyright © 2016
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.520
I'm listening to you.

417. Copyright © 2010
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.400
There's a hole, baby, .
the cave of wonders, .

Jafar, what a surprise?
I’m dying for it.

422. Copyright © 2010
00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.200
But the rule is that only a prince.

423. Copyright © 2010
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.000
You have heard the golden rule,
Isn't that right ?

424. Copyright © 2010
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.400
Whoever has the gold
makes rules.

425. Copyright © 2010
00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.040
Why are you telling me all this
dear treasure with me?

426. Copyright © 2010
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.480
I have a young pair of legs and.
strong behind to pursue him.

427. Copyright © 2010
00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.160
It's a problem.

There's a guy.
We’re here to stay.

Who disturbs sleep?

434. Copyright © 2010
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,000
That’s me, Aladdin.

But really I’m a prince.

1008 marana

Why didn't you tell me?

1009 marana
00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:41.640
Well, you know…

1010 marana
00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:43.840
the kings will come out

Mmm.

1013 marana
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.800
It’s not that easy.

1014 marana

Goodnight, handsome prince.

1015 marana

For the first time in my life […]
things are starting to go well.

1018 marana
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.440
It's a slow motion. It's a slow motion.

1019 marana
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.600
It must be stored.

1020 marana

I was afraid you were tired
welcome, Prince Abooboo.

Why do you.

1022 marana
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.160 pacha
Make sure it never gets discovered.

1023 marana
01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.840 pacha
Never make a mistake. Take a bath
there's a problem with the lamp.

1024 marana
01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.360
How do I live? Al?

1025 marana

Al! Baby, leave it alone.

1026 marana
01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.600 pacha
You can’t fake this.
I can't help you if you don't want to.

1027 marana
01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.600 pacha
You have to say, “Genius,
I want you to save my life.” Do you understand?

1028 marana
01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.920 pacha
Come on, Aladdin!

1029 marana
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.360 pacha
I'll take it.

I’m starting to like you, boy.

1036 marana
01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.240
I don't want to choose
curtains or something.

1037 marana
01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.000
Jasmine was like that.

1038 marana
01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.120
Oh lord, I just felt it
the most wonderful world .

1039 marana

- I'm still excited.

1040 marana
01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.600

A great quality in a woman.

1044 marana
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.680 pacha
I will never marry you.

1045 marana
01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.360 pacha
- Sir, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali is gone.

1046 marana
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.600 pacha
It's better to check yours
another crystal ball, Jafar.

1047 marana
01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.320 pacha
Prince Ali it is!

1048 marana
01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.960 pacha
How about... um. So it’s a good idea!

1049 marana
01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.480
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You want to kill me.

1050 marana
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.560 pacha
What? Ridiculous nonsense, .
Your Highness is very much appreciated.

1051 marana
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.760 pacha
He's clearly lying.

1052 marana
01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.200 pacha
It's obviously a lie.

1053 marana
01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.240 pacha
Dad, what’s wrong with you?

1054 marana
01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.080
I know something is wrong.

1055 marana
01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.120 pacha
Oh, it’s not!

1056 marana
01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.640 pacha
Jafar controls you with it.

1057 marana
01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.560 pacha
What? Jafar is the one?

1058 marana
01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.520 pacha
You are a traitor!

1059 marana
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.720
Juma Alteza, .
all of which can be explained.

1060 marana

1061 marana
01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.240 pacha
Well, that’s it.
They were already dead. Forget about it.

1062 marana
01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.400
Just dig a grave for them both.
They were already dead.

1063 marana
01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.800
Jafar's quick finish.

1064 marana
01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.280 pacha
Not done yet, baby.

1065 marana
01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.360 pacha
Here it is!

1066 marana
01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.160 pacha
- Search everywhere!
-Jasmine, are you alright?

1067 marana
01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.160 pacha
Joo.

1068 marana
01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.520 pacha
Jafar, my trusted adviser,

1069 marana
01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.600 pacha
all the while plotting against me.

1070 marana
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.720 pacha
It’s horrible, just horrible.

1071 marana
01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.960 pacha
How could I ever.

1072 marana
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.960 pacha
¿Eh?

1073 marana
01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.720
Could that be true?

1074 marana
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.280 pacha
My daughter is later
have you chosen a suitor?

1075 marana
01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.440
Ha, ha! Praise be to Allah!

1076 marana
01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:27.360 pacha
You are a very smart young man, .
I can kiss you.

1077 marana
01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.560 pacha
I'm not going to do that.
I've got that in my.

1078 marana
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.320 pacha
But you got married at the same time.

That’s exactly what this kingdom needs.

1085 marana
01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.120 pacha
We need to get out of here.

1086 marana
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.480 pacha
Gotta start packing.
Only the most important things.

1087 marana
01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.840
We've got to slow down.

Bring the guns, bring the guns, .
and what do you think of this picture?

1089 marana

I think I can make a weird face with it.

Oh no, I don't. It's broken.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.800
Without you,
I’m just Aladdin.

1112 marana
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.920 pacha
- Al, you win.
- Friday.

1113 marana
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:20.280 pacha
The only reason we can think of
I’m worth everything, because of you.

1114 marana
01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.440 pacha
And if they knew that
Am I really a prince?

1115 marana
01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:26.280
What if Jasmine found out?
i'm losing it.

1116 marana
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.480
Genius, I can’t do that
keep it myself.

1117 marana
01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.200 pacha
I don't want you to be free.

1118 marana
01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.960 pacha
OK. I understand.
You lied to everyone.

1119 according to the law
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.720
Hey, I’m starting to feel left out.

1120 marana
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.200
I apologize now, Master.

1121 marana
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.800
Genius, I’m so sorry.

1122 marana
01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.520 pacha
OK.
So hang in there.

1123 marana
01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.400
What are you looking at?

1124 marana
01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.520 pacha
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

1125 marana
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.560 pacha
Abu, I’m sorry. I don't know.

1126 marana
01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.560 pacha
Wait. Come on.

1127 marana
01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.160 pacha
What am I doing with myself?

1128 marana
01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.680 pacha
Nero is right.

1129 marana
01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:19.160 pacha
I have to tell Jasmine the truth.

11:30 in the morning
01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.440 pacha
Black bones . You're Ali.
Are you coming here?

1131 marana
01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.800
Well, that’s it.

1132 marana
01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.960 pacha
Is it Jasmine?
Where are you?

1133 marana
01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.720
This is the Menager. Fast.

1134 marana
01:06:30.760 pm --> 01:06:32.760 pm
I'm coming to you.

1135 marana
01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:38.320
Got a problem, Pinky?

1136 marana
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.040
Jerk.

1137 marana
01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.440
Boy, Jafar is happy to see you.

1138 marana
01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:48.320 pacha
- Great job, Lake.
- Let's go.

1139 marana
01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:52.320 pacha
It’s not really a coincidence. It’s on the scale
from one to ten, you are eleven.

1140 marana
01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.760 pacha
Oh Jafar, you are so kind.

1141 marana
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.680 pacha
I'm shy.
I'm shaking yellow .

1142 marana
01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.520 pacha
The people of Agrabah,

1143 marana
01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.560 pacha
my daughter finally
chose a suitor.

1144 marana
01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.000
Jasmine was like that.

1145 marana
01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.960 pacha
Ali, where did you go?

1146 marana
01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.200
Jasmine, there’s something
I have to tell you.

1147 marana
01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:14.120 pacha
The whole kingdom returns
For the Father's Communication.

1148 marana
01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.400 pacha
No, but Jasmine, listen to me.

1149 marana
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.400 pacha
- You don't understand.
- Congratulations.

1150 marana
01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.200 pacha
...He's a Dog!

1151 marana
01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.880 pacha
Oh no, I don't.

1152 marana
01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:29.520 pacha
Look at them,
this little tube t'axllirt'asa.

1153 marana
01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:29.680 pacha
Let them slap each other.

1154 marana
01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.800 pacha
Let them slap each other.

1155 marana
01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.720 pacha
You know, Al, I’m definitely.

1156 marana
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.200 pacha
I don't think you know him.
Ali's role tonight

1157 marana
01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:41.440
present heavy and dark
and a horrible villain.

1158 marana
01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.240 pacha
- Now it's your master.
- That's what I was afraid of.

1159 marana
01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:47.200 pacha
Genie, grant me my first wish.

1160 marana
01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.960 pacha
I want to reign supreme like a sultan.

1161 marana
01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.920 pacha
- Wow!
- Blessed Almaxa.

1162 marana
01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.800 pacha
What is this?

1163 marana
01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:02.880 pacha
What’s going on?
Oh god, what's going on?

1164 marana
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.920 pacha
Father.

1165 marana
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.000 pacha
Jafar, you evil traitor.

1166 marana
01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.920 pacha
For you, the Vile Traitor Sultan.

1167 marana
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Indeed?
We’ll see then.

1168 marana
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.840 pacha
A lampshade.

1169 marana
01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.160 pacha
Visitor Keepers, Abooboo.

1170 marana
01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.400
Genius, right!

1171 marana
01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.920 pacha
Sorry, baby.
Now I have a new master.

1172 marana
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.040 pacha
Jafar, I'm telling you to stop.

1173 marana
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.160
Ah, but now there is a new order.

1174 marana
01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.960 pacha
Nayan ordenaja.

1175 marana
01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.960 pacha
Finally you bowed to me.

1176 marana
01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.880
We will never bow down to you.

1177 marana
01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.000
Why wasn’t I surprised?

1178 marana
01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.440 pacha
If you do not bow to the Sultan,

1179 marana
01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:00.560 pacha
and you knelt down
in front of the witch!

1180 marana
01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:02.840
Genius, my second wish…

1181 marana
01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.080 pacha
I want to be a stronger witch
in the world!

1182 marana
01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.040 pacha
Genius, don’t give up!

1183 marana
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.920 pacha
Brothers, sisters,

1184 marana
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.320 pacha
a welcome to Agrabah
old Jafarille!

1185 marana
01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.280 pacha
Where were we now?

1186 marana
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:25,800 hours
If. Excessive humiliation.

1187 marana
01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.920 pacha
Below, the child.

1188 marana
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.200 pacha
Oh princess.

1189 marana
01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:35.040 pacha
There is death with someone
to identify the

1190 marana
01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.640 pacha
Jafar is a great city. Don't touch him.

1191 marana
01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.640 pacha
#PrinceAli
yes he is#

1192 marana
01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.760 pacha
#But not as you know#

1193 marana
01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.880
#Read my lips
And look real#

1194 marana
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.960 pacha
#Yes, sharing a blast from your past#

1195 marana
01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.400
#whose lies were so good, they didn't last long#

1196 marana
01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:53.800
#Good morning
Dear Prince Ali#

1197 marana
01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.360 pacha
Or should we say Aladdin?

1198 marana
01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.400
Ali?

1199 marana
01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.560 pacha
Jasmine, I've tried to tell you.
I've seen it right...

1200 marana
01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.880 pacha
#That’s how Alix feels
Just like Aladdin#

1201 marana
01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.000
#If it's a scam, please continue#

1202 marana
01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.280
#Believe Me#

1203 marana
01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.520 pacha
#jupan personality pantjasitapa#

1204 marana
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.560 pacha
#give me a valid reason#

1205 marana
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.400 pacha
#Send him packing
One way ticket#

1206 marana
01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.720 pacha
#So hopeful for the future
Create a terminal dive#

1207 marana
01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:23.760 pacha
#His assets frozen, selected disclosure
End of the world, oops!#

1208 marana
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.120 pacha
- Goodbye!
- Good morning, see you soon.

1209 marana
01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:30.040 pacha
#Former Prince Ali#

1210 marana
01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:56.640 pacha
Abu.

1211 marana
01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.760 pacha
¡Abu!

1212 marana
01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.680 pacha
Alas, this is all my fault.

1213 marana
01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.760 pacha
I had to let go of the spirit
when I had the power. Abu.

1214 marana
01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.160 pacha
- Do you agree?
- Mm-hmm smile.

1215 marana
01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.080
I am sorry, Abu.

1216 marana
01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.760 pacha
I mixed it up.

1217 marana
01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.280 pacha
One way or another... I have to go back
and fix things.

1218 marana
01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.720
Jant'aku.

1219 marana
01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.240 pacha
Abu, start digging.

1220 marana
01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.360
Of course.

1221 marana
01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.800
If! Light!

1222 marana
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.640
Now I'm back in Agrabah.
Come on.

1223 marana
01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.040 pacha
Puppet leader wants cookies?

1224 marana
01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.800 hours
These are cookies.
Struck in the back of the neck .

1225 marana
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.120
Here. Let’s find out a lot.

1226 marana
01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.680 pacha
Uk jaytapjjam.
Jafar, leave him alone.

1227 marana
01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.560 pacha
It hurts to see you
and besides, Jasmine.

1228 marana
01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.760
It’s a beautiful desert flower
similar to you

1229 marana
01:12:30.800 pm --> 01:12:34.520 pm
especially in the hand
the world's strongest man.

1230 marana
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.440
What do you say, please?

1231 marana
01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.160
Why, when you’re the queen…

1232 marana
01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.200 pacha
No.

1233 marana
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.840 pacha
I will teach you respect.

1234 marana
01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.600
It’s the Genie.

1235 marana
01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.040
I’ve decided
make my last wish.

1236 marana
01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.000
I want Princess Jasmine

1237 marana
01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.920 pacha
to fall without waiting
with a smile on my face

1238 marana
01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:07.320 pacha
Ah, master, there are a few additions, .
compensation is.

1239 marana
01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.360
don’t answer me
you big green thug.

1240 marana
01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:14.240
What will you do with it
Do it, slave.

1241 marana
01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.160
Jafar is a great city.

1242 marana
01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:22.880 pacha
Never mind how.
You're incredibly beautiful.

1243 marana
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.120
Mmmm. It`s better than that.

1244 marana
01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.760
Now there are four.

1246 marana
01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.680 pacha

Al, I can't help you.

1252 marana
01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.280
I'm currently working on Mr. Psychopath .
What are you guys going to do?

1253 marana
01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:56.240
Hey, I’m a street rat, remember?
I’m going to improvise.

1254 marana
01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.720
...nice little openings
between the teeth.

1255 marana
01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.640 pacha
Jack.

1256 marana
01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.160 pacha
And your beard…

1257 marana
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.240 pacha
it's so... twisted.

1258 marana
01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.400
- You stole my heart.

1259 marana
01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.000 hours
- What's a street snowflake?

1260 marana
01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.720
Is there a street rat?

1261 marana
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28.080
¡Joo !

Juma!

1264 marana
01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.560
How many times
should I kill my son?

1265 marana
01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.880
Get a lamp out.

1266 marana
01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.880
No!

1267 marana
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.520 pacha
Ah, ah, ah, prinsessa.
Your time is running out.

1268 marana
01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.200
Jasmine was like that.

1269 marana
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.880 pacha
Beautiful picture Jaf.

1270 marana
01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.680 pacha
Don't play with me.

1271 marana
01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.120
¡Abu!

1272 marana
01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:07.400
Things are ruined

Made you watch .

The name of ALADDIN
In the distant land where the sun set the desert on fire, there was an ancient secret.
It's a long-forgotten lamp buried in the sand.
It's short and easy .
No fancy designs, no precious jewelry.
It seems boring and useless to everyone but the smartest.
But this lamp is not what it seems.
Long ago, it was the most powerful force in all of Arabia.
It changed the boy's life forever.
A young man, like a lamp, was more than he looked.
The story begins on a dark night where a dark man with a dark purpose lies in wait. . . . . . . . . . . . .
THE FIRST CHAPTER
This man was Jafar and he was willing to wait.
His piercing eyes and pointed turban looked like a cobra about to wrangle.
The parrot sat on his shoulder and nodded impatiently.
Beneath him, his horse shifted and grunted angrily.
The treasure was buried somewhere.
Only one person can find it: an old beetle in two halves.
Jafar had half of it, and soon there would be another.
And the treasure would be his.
And with that he would become the most powerful man in Agrabah .
In the silence Jafar heard the shuffling of feet as a rider approached.
The man was a common thief named Gazeem, and he agreed
Bring Jafar the other half of the beetle in exchange for part of the treasure.
Jafar had promised. Jafar lied to her.
"You're late."
Gazeem dismounted and bowed his head.
Jafar was the royal vizier, the chief adviser to the sultan. It was wrong to hurt him.
"Sorry, be patient," Gazeem said.
Jafar looked at him. "You got it then?" »
Smiling, the robber pulled half a potato out of his pocket.
Jafar grabbed it, but the robber stopped him.
"And the treasure? You mentioned that."
Yell!
The parrot descended from Jafar's arm, caught the clump and threw it at Jafar's bones.
he learns
"Trust me," Jafar said. "You get what's coming to you."
He quickly picked up half of the snow.
Put the halves together and his blood was running.
They were shining. SO...
BOOMOOOM that’s good!
Thunder covered the desert.
The beetle exploded from Jafar's hand as if it were alive.
He crossed the dunes with a light.
Jafar encouraged his horse.
"Quick, follow the path!" he exclaimed in a loud voice.
Gazeem mounted his own horse and ran towards Jafar .
Flashing like a kite, the beetle went to a small sandstone.
He spun it around and stood in mid-air.
K'ak'arata!
The snow was again dipped in half, each half at a small depth
p'yes.
Jafar stopped his horse and fled.
The dancing beetle stared at him with a pair of wide eyes.
A pleasant thrill came over her.
Now there was no turning back.
RRRRRRRMMMMmmmm!
The ground began to shake.
Strange eyes shone brightly.
Gazeem collapsed in fear.
Slowly the rock began to grow.
It grew in all directions and changed its appearance.
The eyes remained, now the ears appeared, then the nose.
Finally his mouth was wide and open .
A pillar of white light emerged from within, nearly blinding Jafar.
Now the stone was like the face of a tiger, roaring quietly in anger.
Jafar looked surprised.
Her frightened parrot grabbed her hand, digging into her claws.
"By Allah!" Gazeem whispered. "Tiger God!"
"Finally, lake!" said Jafar to his parrot. "After all my many years of research, Wonder Cave!"
"Awk," Lago sighed. "The Hole of Wonders!"
Jafar approached Gazeem .
"Now remember," he growled.
“Bring me the lamp.
The treasure is yours now, but the lamp is mine!
Gazeem swallowed hard .
He turned towards the tiger god's mouth and began to walk slowly.
"Awk! That lamp!" Lago repeated loudly for Gazeem to hear.
He then leaned into Jafar's ear and whispered, "Damn, where did you get that bozo?"
—¡Shh! "" Jafar silkäisi.
Lago told no one that he could speak in person, certainly no one except his master.
But now Jafar refused to listen.
He looked around.
Watch and wait.
"Who's fighting dreams!" » the tiger god growled, his voice echoing again on the ground.
"Um...I am, Gazeem, the little thief."
His voice was a frightening cry and his knees were weak and trembling.
"Look at that!" said the tiger god. "Only one person can get here."
Whose rags hide a pure heart – In a rough diamond! »
Gazeem looked behind him hopefully .
"Jack's the one!" » commanded Jafar.
Qazeem turned timidly towards the opening of the cave.
A staircase descends... what? He wouldn't have said that. He began to descend carefully.
RRRRRAAAAAUUQQHHHHHH!
The thunderous roar of the tiger god was not something Jafar had ever heard before.
Gazeem's scream was heard for a moment, and the tiger god's mouth closed,
he silences the thief forever.
"Find that diamond in the rough!" » ordered the tiger god.
Gradually the rock became flat.
Its hollow halves melted and shriveled.
Jafar watched in silence as Lago appeared on the hillside dove and snorting sand.
He gathered the beetle halves and returned to Jafar .
"I can't believe that!" The lake said. "We'll never get the chance to get our hands on that stupid lamp!"
"Patience, lake, patience. Gazeem was no good apparently."
"Now it's a big surprise!" » said Lake, rolling his eyes. "What are we going to do? We're a big one."
the problem here—”
But Jafar reached out and pinched Lake's tail. He needed peace.
“Only one comes in…” he said. "I have to find this, this diamond in the sand."
A rough diamond—Jafar understood what it meant.
A common man, poor and dirty, had great qualities.
There was only one way to find the man, and Jafar knew exactly how to do it.
A devilish smile spread across his face.
He didn't find the treasure tonight, but that didn't matter.
He was close—oh very close.
And before long his wait was over.
PAY PEOPLE
Don't stop, thief!
The guard screamed at the top of his lungs as he chased the scantily clad boy through the crowd.
Agrabah is a market.
The boy deftly zigzagged through the outdoor stalls: fruit vendors, clothes shops, bakers, curious people.
customers.
In his right hand he holds bread.
Beside him ran a little monkey wearing a jacket and hat .
I’ll pick you up, street rat!” shouted the guard.
Street loves. If there was one name that Aladdin hated, it was this one.
The sultan's guards looked down on the poor of Agrabah, like him.
In fact he sometimes stole food.
He had no choice: he had to eat.
But he wasn’t just a street rat.
"Come on, Abu!" Aladdin called to his pet monkey.
He ran to a nearby house and jumped onto a low, flat roof.
And he and Abu ran from roof to roof.
lands on a clothesline and finally drops a soft pile of clothes.
Instantly he grabbed her thick, hairy arms.
It was Rasoul, the leader of the Sultan's guard.
Rasoul was a man of few words, but if there was one thing he was good at, it was catching young thieves.
"I got you!" Rasoul said as he picked up Aladdin.
Abu jumped into Rasoul's arms and pulled the guard's turban over his eyes.
Aladdin was quickly freed and he and Abu escaped.
They passed a camel vendor, a carpet vendor, a jewelery cart in the middle of the market.
Suddenly, Abou stopped.
The little monkey's eyes are glued to the cart.
Abu had one major weakness: sparkling jewelry.
He sat down next to the carriage and reached out to steal the pendant.
"Protect him!" » someone shouted.
The ten faces turned towards Abu.
Aladdin returned. He grabbed Abu by the neck.
On the right, the guards struggled closer.
On the left, the angry citizens approached.
Aladdin and Abu ran straight up the stairs that led to the main tower.
Then they ran down the stairs and out the window.
Aladdin picked up the rug and used it as a parachute, jumping from window to window with Abu.
side of the building.
Again they jumped, this time landing safely in a quiet narrow alleyway that overshadowed the Sultanâ€™s palace.
palace doors.
There, the voices of the market died out.
Aladdin took a deep breath and sat up. He was hungry for food.
"Alright Abu, let's have fun now!" he said, breaking the bread in half.
But before he could eat, he saw a frail boy and girl in the darkness.
They said nothing, but their wide, piercing eyes spoke for them.
Aladdin knew they hadn't eaten in days.
He looked at the bread. He had risked his life to get it, his mouth watering like crazy. But he’s the one
I couldn't let him go hungry.
He was proud and gave it to half the children.
"Come on, take it," he said softly.
Abu frowned but also gave him his money. The girl is smiling.
He took Abu's bread and rubbed it gently.
Abu is the best. People didn't treat him that well.
He picked up his hat and walked away proudly – ​​kicking Aladdin right at his feet.
But Aladdin didn't notice. His gaze was fixed straight ahead.
"Wow…" Aladdin whispered.
The city was quiet.
In the middle was a man on a horse. She was dressed in a fine silk gown embroidered with jewels.
As people cleared the way and bowed, the man proudly raised his chin in the air.
Aladdin walked out of the alley towards the crowd. Everyone was talking about the rich
mies.
"It's Prince Ahmed," she said, "on the way to the palace."
"Just a suitor for the princess," an old man shook his head.
"He proposed and she dumped him, like everyone else."
Aladdin looked at him in surprise. If a princess could turn down someone like that, she would be a wonderful girl!
Aladdin felt a fall on his leg. Abu threw him towards the crowd. Aladdin saw a group of poor people
the kids get too close to Prince Ahmed's horse.
Suddenly the horse ran, frightening the children, and the prince shouted, "Get out of my way, you bastard."
children!"
Aladdin angrily stormed through the crowd and stood up to Prince Ahmed .
"If I were as rich as you," he cried, "I could afford good living!"
"Get out of my way, you flea bitten street rat!" Prince Ahmed kicks his horse and shoots Aladdin,
cast him into the dust.
Burning with rage, Aladdin jumped up and started running on the prince's horse.
"I'm useless! I'm not a street rat!" he exclaimed in a loud voice.
He ran to the palace gates. In a loud voice, .

In the distance stood the Sultan's palace proudly.

Aladdin fell asleep with a sigh.

"But Jasmine, you're a princess!" exclaimed the Sultan.
"Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore!"
"Oooooo!" The Sultan shrugged and went back inside
The throne room.
A shadow appeared behind him. It was the big little shadow of a man

It's a long stick with a snake's head stuck on the end.
The Sultan returned.
"Ah Jafar, my most trusted adviser!" he said, smirking. "I want your knowledge."
"My life is all about serving you," Jafar said firmly, a smile on his thin lips.
"Jasmine doesn't want to choose a husband," Sultana said. "I'm at the end of the rope!"
"Awk! It's over!" The lake shouted.
The Sultana reached into a porcelain bowl and pulled out some cookies. "Cookie bowl. Good Polly?" he said, smirking.
One thing Lake hated was eating cookies . Especially the dry and stale ones from Sultan. The

Jafar smiled at her. "You're so kind, sir," said Jafar. "Run now, play with your toys,

It was early the next morning. Jasmine fled to the palace wall. The Rajah followed close behind, arms flailing

Aladdin chose to be the first. He growled loudly, struggling to speak

It was a carpet walking behind him.

And Abu reached out to make it happen.
"Abou!" exclaimed Aladdin. "No!"
But it was too late. Abu had a jewel in his hand.

"No," said Aladdin. "Well, three of my wishes…"
"Three?" said the spirit. "You cut one, baby!" »
Aladdin smiled an evil smile. “I never really wanted to go out
Hole. You’re the only one who did it!
Nero thought for a moment. "Very nice," he laughed.
'You will win. But there will be no more gifts!”
Aladdin jumped off the carpet and started walking. "Hmm...

"That's the place of genius." Genie shrugged her shoulders.

my first two wishes, and my third wish to save you.
"No, I hope so!" said the spirit. "What do you want now?"
"Well," said Aladdin, "there's that girl…."
"It's wrong! I can't make anyone fall in love, remember?"
"But Genie, she's smart and funny and beautiful."
Aladdin shrugged and looked at the ground. “But she’s a princess.
To have a power, I…”
It was so stupid! He answered the question right in front of him! "Hey!" Aladdin is a brother

Genie sighed heavily. He knew Aladdin was in trouble .
The carpet rolled under Aladdin and Jasmine carried him to the balcony.
Aladdin watched from the window playing with the Rajah.
"Princess Jasmine?" he called out to her.
Jasmine turned and walked towards the window. "Who's here?"
"I am," said Aladdin. Then she remembers the words of Prince Alina
continued: "Prince Ali Ababwa"
"I don't want to see you!" » Jasmine danced.
When he returned to his room, Aladdin got up from the carpet and.

Aladdin retreated into the shadows. 'Toria? Why, I did that

Jasmine walked back into her room.
"The first of May!" The first of May! » said the spirit still disguised as a bee. “Protect him!
Would you like to push him?

Jasmine looked over her shoulder. "What?"
"Um...I mean, sure!" Aladdin exclaimed. “You… are not just a few

Aladdin turned away in despair. He climbed over the railing and.
descended from the balcony into space.
"No!" Jasmine cried out. But Aladdin did not fall: he floated

"How can you do that?" Jasmine said surprised.
"It's a magic carpet," Aladdin said.
Jasmine turned to the railing and touched the carpet. "It's cute."
"You don't want a ride…do you?" Aladdin gives him a
a sign of hope . "We can fly and see the world . . ."
"Is he safe?" » asked Jasmine.
"Of course." Aladdin reached out and smiled. "Can you trust me?"
Can you trust me? Jasmine had heard this reality before, she said

Jasmine understood immediately. “Jafar,” she said with a deceptive smile
I never realized how incredibly beautiful you are!
Jafar turned around. His jaw hung in disbelief—somehow

"That's better," said Jafar. He smiled at Jasmine

"You're tall, dark..." Jasmine saw Aladdin, Abu and the carpet
secretly towards the lamp. Now the spirit saw them. Goes
trying to stifle happy laughter.
"Go..." Jafar said.
Abu was inches away from Lago now – and Lago recoiled.
Jasmine quickly wrapped her arms around Jafar and locked him in place.
"You're well dressed," he continued. "You stole my heart."
With a quick jump he grabbed Abu Lago's perch and extended his hand.
into his mouth. They both fell to the ground.
"What's a street rat?" » said Jafar as he approached Jasmine.
"Any street rats?" asked Jasmine,
¡That's a lot of trouble! Abu and Lago slammed into the table and sent the bowl away
below.
Jafar began to turn away. Jasmine had no choice but to come closer
and kiss her passionately and kiss her on the lips.
Now Aladdin had an opportunity. But he couldn't move. All that he is
he could do nothing but stare. There she was, the girl who risked it for him
his life, embrace... him,
Jafar stepped back . He was pleasantly surprised until he saw his reflection
Aladdin's Jasmine Crown .
"You!" he returned in blind rage. His arm was broken
forward, pointing his wand at Aladdin.
Zzzzzzz that's awesome! A light hit Aladdin's chest. He ran away
backwards, dipping into a pile of jewelry.
"How many times should I kill you, boy!" Jafar said it was his
hand back for another shot .
Jamsine snorted at him and dropped his arm.
"You treacherous brat!" Jafar growled. "Your time is up!"
He swung his wand at Jasmine. He was immediately arrested a
a great hourglass . The upper room filled with dust, and slowly
fell through the opening
on top of him. It was more than a live burial.
Zzzzz that's a great show! Jafar diverted Abu from his wand, swinging a saucer-eating toy monkey.
Zzzzz that's a great show! The carpet began to rip. Aladdin runs to stop him. Jafar is a great city
" he shouted, "Things change fast, baby.
"It's all your fault, street rat! Never come back!"
Zzzzzzz that's awesome! Aladdin jumped back. The sword struck the ground
next to him, and another. He looked around. Dozens of razors
swords fell from the ceiling.
Jafar makes another gesture and a wall of fire rises from the ground.
Aladdin grabbed one of the swinging swords. “Are you afraid to hit me
yourself, you cowardly serpent? » said Aladdin as he held the swords away.
when they fell.
Jafar walked towards Aladdin, forcing him closer to the fire.
"A snake, huh? Maybe you want to see how I can look like a snake!"
Jafar waved his snake staff with both hands. He began to grow,
takes on a monstrous life and wraps itself around Jafar's hair. Swelling,
With a hiss, Jafar turns into a monster
cobra, head raised toward ceiling. The flames rose with him,
becoming a ring of mortal coils around Aladdin.
With an unearthly scream, Jafar stepped forward. Aladdin swung his sword.
Shine! He struck two of Jafar's teeth, which fell to the ground on impact.
"Rickum-rackum, throw this sword at this snake," said the spirit
he exclaimed in a loud voice.
"Get out of here!" » » Jafar sighed. He lunged again with a thud
Aladdin is in town. The sword flew from his hand.
"Under!" » exclaimed the Sultan, looking impassively from above. "Jasmine!"
Aladdin saw the hourglass and left. Sand
she quickly stood up, covering everything but Jasmine's head.
Without his sword, there was only one option. Aladdin ran away

Aladdin ran and escaped through another window.
Jafar followed from window to window, his long body a.

Aladdin drew his sword and ran towards the hourglass .
Jasmine's eyes widened in fear.
Aladdin drew his sword and was ready to shatter the glass .
With a powerful boom Jafar throws him into the wall . He was free…
and he spun his coils to Aladdin.
Aladdin's sword was caught in the middle. It was difficult for him to escape.
"I thought he could outsmart the strongest man on the planet!"
» Jafar exclaimed.
Aladdin ran left and right . In the corner of the room, genius
he looked helpless.
Nero!
Thinking quickly, Aladdin said, "You're not that strong, the Genie is."
it was no stronger than before! He gives you strength, too
I can take it out!”
Genie hid behind a pillar. "Al, what are you doing? Why?"
Are you dragging me here? »
"Look at that, Jafar, you're still second," Aladdin continued.
Jafar found his noose. He turned his furry face to the spirits.
"Exactly. His strength is greater than mine, but not by long!"
Aladdin fell to the ground as Jafar rolled off the ground.

Genie turned to Aladdin, his pale face now as white as chalk. "Your

Quickly Aladdin took his sword and broke the hourglass .
Jasmine rolled forward in a cascade of sand. "Whatever you have."
Is it designed to be so?” he asked, when Aladdin released him.
Aladdin smiled. 'Trust me,' he said.
"The universe is an open book before me!" Jafar shouted . " Mining," he said
command, rule!” The dome of the palace exploded while Jafar was standing
reaching to the sky.
Before he could say a word, the golden chains tightened around his body.

under him, new and shiny.
"What? What's going on?" » asked Jafar.
"You want to be a genius?" Aladdin took a new lamp and.
which he handed over to Jafar. "You got it and everything that goes with it!"
Jafar's footsteps were nothing more than a vapor trail, a trail that disappeared inside
lamp nozzle. "No!" » his eyes twinkled with fear.
"No, I'm not!"
Jafar shouted, raising his arms. Their hands
he shook Lake's legs. "What... hey! Let go!" The lake shouted.
In a boring voice! Jafar and Lago were sucked into the lamp.
Everyone in the throne room fell into a deep silence. Jasmine , 1999 .
The Sultan , and the genius , looked at Aladdin .
"Phenomenal cosmic powers," said Aladdin, shrugging his shoulders. "Toddler

Genie laughed out loud. "Al, you little genius!"
The room immediately began to return to normal. Getting back to his feet, .
The Sultan shouted with pleasure as her clothes appeared on her. Abu
became a living monkey again. The Rajah became a tiger again, breaking
a little out of the cage. And the carpet looked new.
Genie grabbed the lamp and went to the balcony.
"Shall we leave? Let's chill out in Wonder Cave for ten thousand years."
“He turned and threw the lamp and sent it flying overhead.
towards the desert.
Smiling broadly, the genie ran away. It had a grandiose look, .

Jasmine shook her head. "I know why."
"I thought this was greeting?"
Jasmine turned away. "This stupid rule! It's unfair!" Barely,
she cried and looked back at Aladdin. "I love you."
Suddenly a spirit appeared at the window. “Al, it’s okay…
There is only one wish. Say the word and you'll be a prince again!
"But Genie," said Aladdin. "And your freedom?"
"Al, please."
millions of years. Believe me, I was watching."
Aladdin looked at Jasmine intently. He knew how much it cost
now it means salvation. Not for Genius, but for Jasmine – and for that
he did it himself. Like he needed to
In order to escape the Sultan’s orders, Aladdin had to be freed. To be free to be
he did it himself.
“Jasmine…I love you,” he said finally. “But I can’t pretend I am
because I’m not like that.
Jasmine lowered her head. "I understand."
"Genie," said Aladdin, "I want you to be free."
I began to keep my promise.
The golden fists of the spirit disappeared in an instant. He was very surprised. "Fast!
Something lovely, anything! "I ride the Nile!" »
"Oh, I'm waiting for the Nile," said Aladdin.
"FEW!" the spirit said with a laugh. "I'm free!" he cried, his
his face lights up. "I'm free! I'm going to explore the world!"
"Pat's in the back!" » said the Sultan, looking back.
"I like you, Qenie," Aladdin said.
"Me too Al," the spirit replied softly. “Whatever it is
they all say you will be a prince to me! »
"Adequate!" the sultan agreed.
"You've shown me that it's really good for me. If the problem is the law, what is it?"
we need a new law!"
Jasmine looked at him in surprise. "Father!"
"From this day forward, the princess will marry whomever she deems fit!"
"I choose you, Aladdin!" Jasmine cried immediately.
Aladdin was delighted. “Call me Ali,” she said.
He and Jasmine burst out laughing.
Aladdin took her hand and they both started walking around on the balcony.
"OK!" said the spirit with a broad smile, "I can't do any more damage here.
And now I want to leave here!
Well, you crazy lovebirds! »
Nero launched into the sky like a rocket.
The Sultan followed with his eyes until the spirit disappeared into the horizon.
Aladdin and Jasmine didn't even notice him leave.
As they shared a long, dreamlike kiss, not paying much attention to anything else but each other.

JAFAR: You're late.
GAZEEM: A thousand apologies, oh my patience.
JAFAR: So you have?
GAZEEM: We had to cut a couple of throats to get it. (Now it's out

JAFAR: What are you waiting for? Jack!

(GAZEEM hesitates and then advances his foot into the hole. With
    great fear, he plants his foot. Nothing happens.
      He takes a deep breath and continues on. Then comes another scream.

WHAT YOU CAN DO: Stop, thief! I will take the trophy from your hand,

OPINION 1: There he is!
MYTH 2: You can’t escape that easily!
ALADDIN: You think that's easy?

(He looks at the three women and mocks them).

OPINION 1: You two, this road, and you with me. OK
        Look for it.

(ALADDIN puts on a sheet and covers it for disguise.
    He runs into women.)

ALADDIN: Hello, ladies.
WOMAN 1: You're in a bit of trouble this morning, aren't you?
        Aladdin for us?
ALADDIN: A problem? You are welcome. You can only get in trouble
        to be caught--

(A hand grabs ALADDIN's arm and pulls him back. That's right
    first CONSIDERATION. (ALADDIN'S mask falls).

ALADDIN: I'm in trouble!
GUARD: ...and this time--(shouting voice from ABU,
        and the guard's turban falls over him
        the eyes of the ABU punches VALVO in the head, laughing.)
ALADDIN: Perfect timing, Abu!
ASHES: Hey!
ALADDIN: Come on, let's get out of here!
        I have to stay...one jump before the end
        One step ahead of the sword
        I just stole what I couldn't afford
        That’s the whole thing!

(ALADDIN fights with a sword-wielding EXPLOSION. He dodges a few
    swings and then pulls the GUARD'S pants down. ABU raspberries
    DO ANYTHING, then attack and dodge. THE GUARD hovers over ALADDIN,
    but also destroys the barrel of fish. Like ALADDIN HAS MONEY, TO PROTECT HIM
     a fish pulls his pants-like lower body.)

        A leap forward from law enforcement
        It is, and it is no joke
        These guys don't like me being broke!

(ALADDIN and ABU run over a pile of barrels, then a barrel.
    second EXPLANATION.)

GUARDS: (together) Riffraff! Damn you rat!
        Charlatan is the best! You have to take it!
ALADDIN: A little snack, guys!

(ALADDIN runs upstage. THE GUARDS shudder
    the level goes back and forth trying to destroy it.)

GUARDS: Tear it up, send it back guys!
ALADDIN: I've got the hint, I have to face the facts
        ¡Juma sapakïtawa, Abu!
WOMAN: Who?!?

(ALADDIN jumps to his death from the stage to catch the ABUs.
    his hands are acrobatic . The couple becomes a harem.)

        Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom
        He becomes a bachelor, he increases the evil

(ABU finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth with it in a.
    of course.)

WOMAN: I'd blame the parents, but he doesn't have them!
ALADDIN: I must eat to live, I must fly to eat
        I will tell you all about it when I have time!

(ALADDIN and ABU exit. Cut to MUSCLEMAN leans into the crowd
    APYT leaves quickly. Cut to ALADDIN and ABU behind MUSCHEMMAN,
     matching his behavior until he makes mistakes and gets caught.)

        Slow down and slow down and jump forward
        Stepping forward from my loss
        Next time I will use a pen name.
        A leap forward hitters
        One step ahead of the pack
        I think I’m going to take a walk around the neighborhood.

(They will do the sequence where ALADDIN and ABU, behind the GUARDS,
    running through a flock of sheep, climbing the barrier of a sleeping MAN
    claws {actually a serious WARNING descends on him}. IT MUST BE EXISTING
     disguises herself with jewelry until she finds the SELLER.

PEOPLE: Stop, thief! Vandal is the best!
        It’s a surprise! It's a scandal!
ALADDIN: Let's not hurry

(ALADDIN is surrounded by GUARDS in front of the door. The door opens
    out comes a big, ugly LADY.)

LADY: Still, I think it's nice

(ALADDIN sits up and wraps his arms around him in remembrance as he moves
    as if they were all friends.)

ALADDIN: I must eat to live, I must fly to eat
        Otherwise, we will get along!
GUARDS: DO NOT!

(Everyone jumps and fights. When they stop, ALADDIN and.
    The ABU has left. They fall in barrels. They're running away
    through a burning pit, after which the RUMINERS crawl up and down, .
    breaking stones and screaming in distress. ALADDIN and ABU
    passes ua SWORD BEATING, and ABU returns, draws sword
    From the mouth of NIELIJA. ABU advances to the guards,
    who turn back in fear.)

OPINION 1: He has a sword!
GUARD 2: You idiot, we have ALL swords!!

(ABU carefully lowers his sword and runs. ALADDIN and ABU are like that
    around again, and SHOUTINGS come left and right.
      He jumps and climbs a dressage that is done on the street,
     when the GUARDS shoot each other.)

ALADDIN: One step forward hoof stuck!
PEOPLE: Vandal!
ALADDIN: One leap forward snowflake!
PEOPLE: Street rats!
ALADDIN: A Journey Before the Trouble
PEOPLE: You bastard!
ALADDIN: They're fast, but I'm faster
PEOPLE: Take it!

(GUARDS lead ALADDIN up the stairs to his room. He has a.
     carpet and window outlet) .

ALADDIN: Come on, I'd better put my hand on it
        I wish you a safe landing
        All I have to do is jump!

(GUARDS chase him through the window, but go right down
     street and land in a pile with a sign that reads "Crazy Hakim's
    Discount fertilizer” now. ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute
    to land safely. ALADDIN and ABU compliment each other
    sell.)

ALADDIN: And now, sir, celebration! Light!

(ALADDIN splits the loaf in half and gives half to ABU, who starts
    eat. But ALADDIN looks up and sees two small children
    searching through garbage cans for food . Then IMPAX sees it
    he throws away what he finds and tries to hide. Then ALADDIN looked at them
    bread, and ABU.)

ABU: That's right!

(ABU takes a big bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks away
    for the children. The girl takes out her brother.)

ALADDIN: Well, take it.

(The kids laugh happily. ABU tries to eat the potatoes,
    and look guilty. He's close to the kids and they're his
     bread for them. They patted him on the head with joy).

ABU: Ah, don't do that. Or is it a ?

(ABU watches ALADDIN enter the daylight where the parade is taking place
    continues.ALADDIN looks over the shoulders of the crowd. He sees it
    PRINCE ACHMED on horseback.)

PASSENGER 1: On the way to the palace, I think.
BYSTANDER 2: Another suitor for the princess.

(ALADDIN is startled as the two children run from the room.
    in the alley. THE BOY ran before the PRINCE horse, .
    surprise him.)

PRINCE: Get out of my way, brat!

(The PRINCE raises his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN
    jump in front of them and grab the whip.)

ALADDIN: Hey, if I were as rich as you, I'd buy some customs
PRINCE: Oh... I'll teach you to walk!

(The PRINCESS throws ALADDIN into a ditch. The audience laughs at him).

ALADDIN: Look, Abu. We don’t see it every day a
        a horse with two hind limbs!

(The PRINCE stands and turns to ALADDIN.)

PRINCE: You're a worthless street rat. You were born
        street rat, you're a dead street rat, and that's it
        your fleas will weep for you.

(ALADDIN rushes to the prince, but the castle gates are locked
    appeared on his face.)

ALADDIN: I am not vain. And I don’t have fleas. Come
        Go ahead, Abu. Let’s go home.

(ALADDIN goes into his house and sees the sight and returns
    ABU at night.)

ALADDIN: Riffraff, katrotta.
        I didn't buy it.
        If only they had looked more closely
        Did they see the poor boy? Not the father.
        They'd know there was more to me.

(Pulls back the curtain to reveal a beautiful palace).

        One day Abu, things will change. Welfare
        rich, I live in a palace and I've never had any problems
        all the characters.

(It melts to the same level during the day. Inside photo of SULTAN's bedroom.
     The door suddenly opens and PRINCE ACHMED flees, lost
    back of pants.)

PRINCE: I've never been so humiliated!

SULTAN: Oh Prince Ahmed. You wouldn’t leave that early, would you?
        Juma?

PRINCE: Good luck marrying her!

SULTAN: Oh Jasmine! Jasmine is alright! Jasmine is alright! (The SULTAN leaves
        goes to the garden in search of his daughter. The
        finds, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE's son.
        a pet tiger prevents . RAJAH is a sign
        from the prince's breeches to his mouth.SULTAN
        holds the cloth and removes it from RAJAH's mouth.)
        To hell with you, Rajah! That’s why Prince Ahmed did it
        fight!
JASMINE: Oh, Dad. Rajah was playing with him,
        Unless you are the Rajah. (The RAJAH approaches and replies
        JASMINE reaches out and kisses her.) You were playing
        this overdressed and self-promoting Prince Ahmed,
        Isn't that right ? (He smirks at RAJAH, pleased
        until he looked at his angry father for a moment. )
        Mmm.
SULTAN: My dear, you must stop ignoring all suitors
        who will call. The law states that.
BOTH: ...be married to a prince.

(Head towards the pigeon cage).

SULTAN: Until the next birthday.
JASMINE: The law is wrong.
SULTAN: Only three days!
JASMINE: Dad, I hate this. (He takes it
        pigeon out of the cage and strokes.) If I get married, .
        I want it to be out of love.
SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not just this rule. (He shakes his hand at her
        pigeon, and he puts it back in the cage.) Not me
        It will last forever and I just want to do it
        sure you'll be taken care of, hopefully.
JASMINE: Try to understand. I never do anything about myself
        own. (He swirls his arm around in the water
        pond, petting fish.) I've never been real
        friends. (The RAJAH growled at him).
        Except you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he's back
        sleep.) I never left the palace
        the walls of the
SULTAN: But Jasmine, you are a princess.
JASMINE: Well, maybe I don't want to be a princess. (The
        the water is sprinkled.)
SULTAN: Oooohhh! May Allah protect you
        imill children!

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a moment. JASMINE goes towards the pigeon.
    pull the cage and the door open . People are running for their lives.
      He watches them leave. The value of the int. from the apartments of the SULTAN.)

SULTAN: I don't know where he got it. His mother’s
        it was not that difficult. (A shadow falls on him.
        He looks up in surprise and sees JAFAR.) Ooh, oh.
        Ah, Jafar, my most trusted advisor. I’m going to be there
        your knowledge is needed.
JAFAR: My life is all about serving you, sir. (He kneels down).
SULTAN: It’s like this pretender. Jasmine refused
        choose your husband. I am at the end of the thread.
IAGO: (in parrot voice) Aww! Head roll .
SULTAN: Ah, yes, yes. Enjoy, beautiful Polly! (The
        takes a cookie out of his pocket. IAGO shows up
        with a lot of fear. The SULTAN then introduces IAGO
        entering the mouth. IAGO winces as he tries to eat. JAFAR'S FACEBOOK
        and SULTANI both laugh.)
JAFAR: His Majesty must have a problem with gentle animals.
        (IAGO looks at him.) Now maybe I can
        figure out how to solve this difficult problem.
SULTAN: Who can help, that's you.
JAFAR: Ah, but I'd have to use mystical blue for that
        diamante sat diamante.
SULTAN: Oh, my ring? But it has remained in the family ever since
        years.
JAFAR: We have to find a suitor for the princess.
        (JAFAR emphasizes the word "princess".
        second syllable "cess". He spun his wand around
        and the cobra's head is turned towards the SULTAN. His eyes
        the rod begins to glow. The room goes dark, JAFAR's room
        the language goes deeper and deeper. The eyes of the SULTAN
        looking mesmerized.) Don't worry. All
        it will be very useful.
SULTAN: Everything will be fine.
JAFAR: But diamonds.
SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Everything you need is well equipped.

(The SULTAN takes the ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room lights up
    returning to normal when JAFAR removes the stick.)

JAFAR: You're so kind, Liege. Now let's run and
        play with your little toys.
SULTAN: (Still mesmerized) Yeah... that's... very nice.

(JAFAR and IAGO come out. We follow them. As he leaves the room,
    the parrot pokes at the cookies.)

IAGO: I can't take it anymore! I have to darken it
        other than those moldy, disgusting cookies... bam!
        I'm fighting!

(JAFAR pulls out a rope, indicating a hidden entrance to their rooms).

JAFAR: Calm down, Iago.
IAGO: Then I grabbed his head. Hit! Hit!
JAFAR: (Talking to IAGO.) I'm about to be Sultan, aren't I
        aka confused idiot.
IAGO: And then I threw cookies down his throat! Huh
        ¡Hah!

(The couple enter the door and splash. Diss. towards the garden.
    evening. A dark man walked through it. We see it’s JASMINE
    disguised. He reaches the palace wall and begins to climb it.
      RAJAH threw him behind him.)

JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can’t stay here and.
        Life is to be lived for me. I will miss you. (The
        starts climbing again and RAJAH helps him,
        who starts coughing and complaining.) Goodbye!

(He disappears over the wall. Picture of the day on ALADDIN Street
    and the ABU is ready to get into trouble again . They are at the top
    fruit stand awning.)

ALADDIN: Well, Abu. Go!

(ABU dives into the sea and looks at the OWNER.)

OWNER: (To Owner) Try that, taste buds
            dances, songs. (ABU is melon and.
            hangs in there and distracts.) Hey, .
            remove it from the top.
ABU: ¡Blah blah!
OWNER: Well you! Get out of here you dirty monkey!

(He takes the melon out of ABU’s hand. But in the foreground, ALADDIN
    bends over and plucks another melon from the stands.)

ABU: Good morning!

(He rises. THE OWNER brings a melon before him,
    where he puts it on the pile. He looks confused
    he just did it.)

ALADDIN: Very well, Abu. Breakfast will be served.

(ALADDIN and ABU open a melon on the roof and eat it. J.
    ASMINE walks down the street.)

SHOP 1: Good woman, buy a bowl. There is no finer bronze vessel
            or money.
SELLER 2: Sweet dates, sweet dates and figs! Sugar
            dates and pistachios!
SHOP 3: Should a woman wear a necklace? Nice
            a necklace for a beautiful woman.

(He's in love with the process, but is surprised by the fish's attack
    appeared on his face.)

4 SHOP: Fresh fish! We caught them, you bought them!
JASMINE: I don't think so. (He turns back, but is destroyed
        a fire-eater who marvels at devouring his own
        fire.) Excuse me. (He swallows and then vomits
        fire comes out of his mouth. JASMINE HATES IT. He is
        happy and rubbing his stomach. ALADDIN saw him,
        and a strange look appears on his face.) I am
        really worrying.
ALADDIN: (He obviously loves her.) Wow!

(He throws his jacket over Hupu's head. ABU sees this and.
    jumps into his arms, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN
    face.)

ABU: That's a great example. Good morning? Good morning?

(JASMINE stops at a fruit stand and sees a small homeless child.
    look for a product. He takes one and gives it to her
    juparu.)

JASMINE: Oh, you must be hungry. Here’s the existing one. (THE
            the young man ran away.)
OWNER: You better be able to pay.
JASMINE: (Mystified) Jig?
OWNER: No one stole the basket!
JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I don't have the money.
OWNER: Thief!
JASMINE: Please, if you'll let me go to the palace, I'll go
            receiving from the sultan.
OWNER: Do you know the punishment for stealing?

(He takes her hand and deliberately pins it to the table
    stop.)

JASMINE: No, no, thank you!

(The sword is thrown, but is stopped by ALADDIN's hand).

ALADDIN: Thank you, good sir. I am so glad you found it
            your. I'm looking for you everywhere.
JASMINE: ( whispering) What are you doing?
ALADDIN: (whispers backwards) Play.
OWNER: Do you know this girl?
JASMINE: Unfortunately, yeah. She’s my sister. He's just a little bit
            mad. (He wraps his arms around his ears.
            He is annoying. The OWNER caught it
            ch'alla.)
OWNER: He said he knew the Sultan!
ALADDIN: He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

(ABU packs his pockets. Hearing this he wakes up.
    JASMINE, soittaen mukana, polvistuu ja kumartuu ABU:lle.) JASMINE.

JASMINE: Oh wise Sultan ukat juk'ampinaka. ¿How can I serve you ukaxa?
ABU: Janiwa, blaa blaa blaa.
ALADDIN: ¿Tragic, isn't it? (He leans forward and chooses ukat juk'ampinaka
            ota kärrystä toinen
            leg.) But no harm was done. (He walks towards ukat juk'ampinaka
            Jasmine.) Tule nyt sisko. This is called aika nähdä
            lääkäri and so on.
JASMINE: (lähellä seisovalle kamelille) That's great.
            How's it going?
ALADDIN: Ei, ei, ei. Ei tämä. (ABU:lle, mukaan lukien
            pockets are bulging.) Come, Sultan ukat juk'ampinaka.

(ABU bows to the audience and everything he stole from the carts falls ukat juk'ampinaka
    out.)

OWNER: Great? What is this? (ABU collects what it can
            bear, and all three escape.) Come back here,
            you little thieves!

(Cut to the depths of the JAFAR lab. IAGO spins a gear in a strange state.
    gadgets in the field. A storm will blow over the ship).

IAGO: (blushing and puffing) With all due respect, it's yours
        rotten, can we not expect a real cold?
JAFAR: Hold your breath, Iago. It's much faster! (He's set
        THE SULTAN'S RING is on the boat.)
IAGO: Yeah, oh big bad.

(IAGO runs faster. Flame crosses to the ring, past the front
    the hourglass image . The sand begins to swirl.)

JAFAR: Ah, dusts of time, show me who can do it
        enter the hole. (The mud on the floor makes a hole
        Performing miracles. It fell into a storm, but he
        shows ALADDIN climbing a ladder and following
        JASMINE, she's covered in her coat.) Yeah, yeah!
        Here’s the existing one. My diamond is hard!
IAGO: Is that him?!?! That’s the clown
        are you waiting (IAGO loses his leg and is forced to suck
        located in gear.)
JAFAR: Let the guards send him an invitation
        palace, right?

(IAGO walks past and headbutts the wall).

IAGO: They were.

(JAFAR laughs menacingly, and the camera zooms into the dust storm
    Inside the ALADD. Finally, we focus on the actual escalation of ALADDIN
    stair patat JASMINE sat chachan arktasa.)

ALADDIN: I'm already there.

(JASMINE crosses over, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms.
    He got up.)

JASMINE: I want to thank you for arresting this man.
ALADDIN: Forget it. (He grabs the stick.) So, so
        first time in the market right?

(ALADD pole-jumps to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE: So obvious?
ALADDIN: Well, you're welcome. (She looks up at him,
        with great affection. He returns her gaze. But he’s the one
        he realizes what he is doing and returns to normal.)
        I mean, you wouldn’t know how bad it is
        Agrabah would be it. (He puts the board in the middle
        in buildings he can walk but when inclined
        jumped on his head inside. He looks back
        suddenly. He threw a stick at her. Both
        ALADDIN and ABU's eyes widen.)
JASMINE: I'm a fast learner.
ALADDIN: That's true. Come here. (They come upstairs
        away from the house, boards and beams
        come on.) Huh. Keep your head in there . Be careful.
JASMINE: Do you live here?
ALADDIN: Yes. I'm with Abumpiki. Come, go as you please.
JASMINE: Very nice.
ALADDIN: Well, there's not much, (he draws the curtain and.
        shows the palace), but offers a fascinating view.
        The palace looks really nice, doesn’t it?
JASMINE: Oh, that’s lovely.
ALADDIN: I wonder what it would be like to live there
        there are slaves and servants…
JASMINE: That's fine. People who tell you where to go and how to get there
        isi.
ALADDIN: Much better than this place. They're always looking for food
        and dodging guards.
JASMINE: You are not free to make up your own mind.
ALADDIN: Sometimes it's.
JASMINE: You just.
BOTH: (together) – caught.

(They look at each other and realize each other’s perfection
    second. But ALADDIN realizes where he is and breaks it
    Treat. He takes the apple from ABU’s hand and twists it around in his hand
    hand in JASMINE's arm.)

ALADDIN: So where did you come from?
JASMINE: What does it matter? I run and I'm not like that
        returning.
ALADDIN: Really? (He bites his apple
        hand and points to ABU who is known for his hostility
        look at his face.)
ABU: Why you!

(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE).

JASMINE: My father is forcing me to marry him.
ALADDIN: It's... terrible. (ABU appears in the background
        princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!

(ABU runs to a higher level, talking and cursing as he goes).

JASMINE: What about you?
ALADDIN: Abu says... uh... that's not fair.
ABU: What is it?
JASMINE: Oh, huh?
ALADDIN: Yes, of course.
JASMINE: And does Abu have anything else to say?
ALADDIN: Well, I hope he does something
        autonaka.
ABU: ¡Ay wayna!
JASMINE: Hmm, you have to say that’s cool.

(Until ALADDIN and JASMINE get closer and closer
    ALADDIN leans in for a kiss. However, this is prohibited
    THE GUARDS who found them.)

ANSWER: You’re there!
ALADDIN and JASMINE: They found us! (to each other) They
                When is it?
JASMINE: My father must have sent them…
ALADDIN: Can you trust me?
JASMINE: What about you?
ALADDIN: Can you trust me? (He raises his hand)
JASMINE: Yeah. (He takes it).
ALADDIN: Then jump!

(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt
    try to escape, but the GUARD blocks the exit.)

WARNING: Let's keep crossing paths, shall we?
        the street snow?

(Again ABU shoots at VALTIJAN's turban, but the other guards are shot
    here and exit prevent . The first RUSH takes ABU out of his head and.
     throw it into the jar. Three guards catch ALADDIN.)

ANSWER: This is a prison for you, kid.
ALADDIN: Hey, I gotta leave!
JASMINE: He has to go.
RULER: (Not realizing his princess) See what we
        here, gentlemen, a street snowflake. (He throws it away
        is.)
JASMINE: (stands up and removes the hood of her coat)
        He must go at the princess’s command.

(THE GUARD suddenly stands and bows, forcing ALADDIN to kneel).

ANSWER: Princess Jasmine.
ALADDIN: ¿Má princesa?
ABU: (looks at the vase) Princess?
RULER: What are you doing outside the palace? And with that
        aka calle rata?
JASMINE: Not your problem. Just do as I say. Release
        juparu!
RULER: Well, I want to, princess, but my rules come from that
        Jafar is a great city. Talk to him about it.

(GUARDS lead ALADDIN away, kneeling.)

JASMINE: (looking angry) Believe me, I do
        will.

(Showing inside the palace, JAFAR secretly emerges from his apartments. He.
    softly opens the door, but the princess enters immediately
    before concluding. He closes it and traps IAGO inside.
    door frame.)

JASMINE: Jafar?
JAFAR: Oh, princess.
IAGO: Oh! Jafar, I'm stuck!
JAFAR: How can I help you? (He's his.
        layer, door magnet.)
JASMINE: The guards took a guy from the market to you
        rules.
JAFAR: Your father charged me with peace of mind
        Agrabah in the woods . The boy was a bad guy.
JASMINE: What was the case?
IAGO: You can't breathe, Jafar!
JAFAR: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.
IAGO: You just... (JAFAR brings him back inside
        door slams) - wow, that sucks!
JASMINE: He didn't kidnap me! I was running away!
JAFAR: (walking away in shock) Oh my God! Oh why
        it hurts terribly. I'd be a scientist.
JASMINE: What do you mean?
JAFAR: Unfortunately, the young man's sentence has already been served
        out.
JASMINE: Kuna phrasesa?
JAFAR: (sinful voice) Death. (JASMINE smiles).
        With the beating.
JASMINE: No! (He falls to the ground).
JAFAR: I'm so sorry, princess.
JASMINE: How do you do it? (She screams and runs from the room).

(IAGO finally manages to get out the door. He runs forward
    Jafar's hand, coughing.)

IAGO: How did it go?
JAFAR: I think he carried himself well. (Both a
        the sad smile on their faces.)

(Diss. to JASMINE at night, weeping by the well. RAJAH
    comes to comfort him. She gives him a hug.)

JASMINE: It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't know him
        made by them.

(Cut to dungeon. The rats rush out and we descend into view
    ALADDIN is chained to the wall.)

ALADDIN: (to himself) She's a princess. I don't believe it
        the. I must have looked silly to him.
ABU: (jaya) Yoo-hoo! Aladdi n? Ask everyone!

(The ABU is in the window above the dungeon).

ALADDIN: Abu! Here! Hey, please help me with this.

(ABU stops, then starts talking wildly, falling to the ground. He.
     drapes the cloth over his head and looks at him with wide eyes
     a princess's imitation.)

ALADDIN: Hey, he was in trouble. Ah, he’s good enough.

(ABU jumps into ALADDIN's arms and pulls out a small set of tools
    takes it out of his pocket and releases ALADDIN.)

ABU: Jïsa, jïsa, jïsa.
ALADDIN: Don't worry, Abou. I will never see him again. I am
        street rat, remember, and there is a rule. He is
        I should marry the prince who deserves it.

(ABU eventually frees ALADDIN's hands).

ABU: Not at all!
ALADDIN: (slaps his wrists) I—I'm a fool
FACT: You're a fool if you let it go, kid.

(We see an old man sitting in the corner who is neither ALADDIN nor ABU
    I have seen this before.)

ALADDIN: Who are you?
SMALL: A humble prisoner like you. But together,
        perhaps more than that.
ALADDIN: I'm listening.
CHIEF: There's a hole, baby. Cave of Wonders . Ok
        with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
        Plenty of treasure to impress your princess
        veto the action.

(The audience understands that the LITTLE MAN said the word
    "princess" means "prince-CESS" instead of the usual pronunciation
     In the "PRIN cess" field. THE LITTLE MAN steps back and IAGO stays behind
    his head pops out of JAFAR's "adult" mask.)

IAGO: Jafar, can you hurry? I’m dying for it!
ALADDIN: But the law says only a prince can marry...
CHIEF: You heard the golden rule, didn't you, son?
        Whoever has the gold makes the rules. (He smiles,
        very bad mouth appearance.)
ALADDIN: Then why would you tell me all this strange stuff?
        treasure with me?
YOUNG MAN: I want a guy with strong legs and power
        I will return to it later.
ALADDIN: Ah, trouble. You’re outside, are we here?

(HE walks towards the wall and looks for a hidden exit).

EYES: Mmm, mmm, mmm. Things are not as simple as they seem.
        seem So we have a deal?

(ALADDIN turns to ABU, who extends his hand).

ABU: Oh, um.

(Cut to wilderness scene. We see ALADDIN leading the horse
    LITTLE PEOPLE and ABU are there. Insult. In the Cave of Wonders.)

HEART: Who disturbs my sleep?
ALADDIN: I'm sorry, Aladdin.
HEART: Let’s move on. Do not touch anything other than the lamp.

(The pit opens with a loud bang and stairs appear in front of it
    The name of ALADDIN. )

RIGHT: Remember, son, bring me a lamp first and then
        you got your reward.
ALADDIN: Come on, Abu. (To hide the ABU under the arm
        with his jacket.)

(ALADDIN starts down the stairs. He reaches the bottom
    and entered a golden chamber full of treasures.)

ALADDIN: I want to know!
EXIT: ¡Ay!
ALADDIN: Just a few of those things could make me richer
        like a sultan!

(ABU watches, sees treasure, then runs to it).

ALADDIN: ¡Abu!

(ABU stops midway, slumps on the carpet on the floor).

ALADDIN: Don't touch anything! We need to find the lamp.

(They start walking across the room as the carpet rises
    from the ground and begins to follow them. The ABU is a source of inspiration
    they are persecuted.)

ABU: Now?

(He turns around and MATTO is lying on the ground. He continues and.
    MATO starts following again. Once again the ABU is back though
     Flip the ALFORMA and hit the treasure pile. IT MUST BE EXISTING
     He runs towards ALADDIN and pulls down his trouser leg.)

ABU: Aladdin is good! Aladdin is great!
ALADDIN: Abu, can you stop him?

(Again MAT follows, but this time when ABU turns MAT
    to jump to the other side. He comes down with the pompom and throws it
    ABU is the heart of the matter. When ABU jumps, MATO goes back to the other side
     so. This time ABU landed in karate. ALFORMA can be found
    lies down and takes off ABU's hat and then puts it on himself. The ABU is seated
    he thought for a moment, until MATO pointed an acorn in front of him
     face. ABU and CARPET both jump in fear and run. ABU has attacks
     ALADDIN then turns his head to look at the ALFORMA.)

ALADDIN: Abu, what are you... crazy?

(Behind the treasure pile is a carpet).

ALADDIN: The Magic Carpet! Come on. Get out of here. I'm not going to go
        it also hurts your heart.

(Mato comes out slowly, creepily, and picks up ABU's hat and ashes
    it's closed. He runs over to ALADDIN and hands his hat to the ABU next to him.
     him. (ABU screams and jumps into ALADDIN's arms).

ALADDIN: Calm down, Abu. He doesn't want to bite.

(MATO picks up ABU's hat again and hands it over. ABU trembles
    fists and screams at it. MATTO starts to walk away, "unfortunately.")

ALADDIN: Hey, wait a minute. Don't go to the gym. Maybe you can help
        We. (ALFORMA looks back in excitement. Then runs off
        and circles the couple.) Hey, huh! You
        trying to find this lamp. (RUG
        motions for them to follow him.) I think he knows
        wherever it is.

(They go into a big cave until they grow up
    an underground cave. In the center of the room is a large pillar,
     the stairs leading up to it. Surrounded by water
     unevenly placed stones form a bridge. Be
    the pillar is a clear ray. ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)

ALADDIN: Wait here!
ABU: You. Or is it a ?

(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey. The long legs are a
    a large ruby. ABU was drawn hypnotically. ALADDIN climbs up
     the stairs go fast . CARPET sees ABU and holds his tail in a futile attempt
     to catch him. ALADDIN finally gets the TAG LAMP.)

ALADDIN: Is that right? We got to the right place
        here... (He looks down and sees ABU freeing himself
        INstead of taking off the rug and running to the jewelry.) Abu-
        NO!

(ABU grabs the jewelry. A bang is heard and the room begins to collapse).
    thalsuña.)

HEARTBREAK: Infidels!
EXIT: ¡Ay!
PUICHAWIN'S WORD: You have touched the forbidden treasure. (THAT'S IT
               putting the jewel back on the foot, but the jewel
                and the shrine turned to lava.) Now you
                never see the light of day again!

(ALADDIN runs down the stairs, but they get stuck on a ramp, and he.
    it descends towards the sky until it flies into the air. The waters had changed
     wash. He pulls towards her when suddenly the CARPET appears
    and seize him. The ABU stands on a rock
    bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks turning to lava .
    Then the ALFORNA rushes in and ALADDIN catches him, as he catches the last stone
     flow.)

ALADDIN: Wow! Mats, let’s go!

(Together they run through caves avoiding walls and falls.
    trash. (ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and rubs his eyes).

ALADDIN: Abu, now is not the time to panic! (He also leaves the ABU
        head and runs into the wall.)
        Start panicking.

(ALFORMA goes into a dive and goes through another hole. Eventually they.
    exit through the inner door. Outside, the hole begins
     grunts and closes . MATO and company are already at the top when a
    the stone falls on the snow and sends it to the ground. ALADDIN catches it
    stone wall and hold. He sees the old man from above,
    amparapankiwa.)

ALADDIN: Help!
NOW: Throw me a lamp!
ALADDIN: I can't stand it. Give me your hand.
NOW: Give me the lamp first!

(ALADDIN reaches out and pulls out the EARTH LAMP. He holds it, a
    and the LITTLE MAN raises it above his head.)

LITTLE MAN: Ha ha ha ha! If! finally! Ha ha ha ha!

(ALADDIN comes out with ABU's help. But BEFORE
     THE MAN pushes ABU away and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.)

ALADDIN: What are you doing?
RIGHT: I will give you your reward. (JAFAR turns to him
        normal voice.) To you eternal reward.

(He pulls out a coiled dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when.
    ABU bit his wrist . He screams but ALADDIN,
     it's thrown into a cave. LITTLE Man throws ABU into the hole at the same time
     OK. They’re lying down. CARPET can see it though below
     rock. He tries to escape, and he escapes. It's a race
     and grabbed ALADDIN, but he slammed into the wall several times
    times and unconsciously . Above, the pit roars
    the last time it then falls flat again . JAFAR is the best
     his mask.)

JAFAR: Hey hey hey! That’s what I have. It’s all mine! I (he is not
        find in his pocket) --- where? Don't be afraid!!

(The kiss disappears into JASMINE's room. She sits beside her bed
    RAJAH who looks sad. Enter the SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Jasmina? Oh dear brother. What’s the wrong thing?
JASMINE: Jafar... did... something... horrible. (The
        He seems to be crying.)
SULTAN: There, there, there my son, we'll settle things.
        Now tell me everything.

(Cut to the bottom of the cave. ALADDIN is lying unconscious on GUSUN.
    (ABU tries to wake him up).

ABU: Oh, oh. Is it Aladdin? Develop. Aladdin is a brother.

(TAPIT gets up and picks up ALADDIN. He gets up slowly).

ALADDIN: Oh my head. (He looks at the sealed entrance).
        They were arrested. (Angrily, crosses his arms towards it
        enter) This two-faced boy! (more beautiful)
        Whoever it was, he’s long gone with the lamp.
ABU: Jesus!

(ABU takes the MAGIC LAMP)

ALADDIN: Well, you short-haired thief! It's so characteristic
        filthy, worthless empty. Hi, I think so
        something's written here, but it's hard to understand
        jump'ata.

(He flicks the LAMP. Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole,
    The LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN catches the light.
    LAMP and our best friend GENIUS.)

GENIE: Aaaaahhhhh! Oh! Give you ten thousand years
        what a pain in the neck! (He is ALADDIN a
        near the rock. Then he shakes his head and turns away
        circles, screaming as he does. A THROAT a
        Headed by ALADD.) Wow! Is it okay to be like that
        get out of here! (GENIE uses the tip of his lamp to pe
        microphone.) Welcome back, ladies and
        Messrs. Hi, where are you coming from? (He puts on the microphone
        (Face of ALADDIN.) What's your name?
ALADDIN: Uh, al--uh--Aladdin.
GENIUS: ( says his name, as if he's got something
        half-smile) Aladdin! (The neon sign flashes
        It is surrounded by lights with the name ALADDIN. THE
        Check the changes indicating the next line of GENIE.)
        Greetings to Aladdin. It's great to have you on the show. Butter
        we've got "Al?" » Or maybe "Din?" "Or whatever."
        the "Laddi?" » (GENIE disappears, then dog
        wrapped in plaid jumps in.) It’s like: “Here boy!
        Come on, Laddi!
ALADDIN: (shaking his head) I hit my head harder.
        I thought I was going to.
GENIE: (Still doggy) Do you smoke? Would you mind if I did? (Dog
        puff of smoke and then back to GENI . IT MUST BE EXISTING
        screams wildly.) Oh sorry Cheetah, I hope so
        I didn't smoke sticky! Hi Rugman! I haven't seen it
        you guys in a few thousand years! Give me that pompom! Hey!
        If! (MATTO runs up and greets NERO.
        GENIUS turned to ALADDIN.) Suppose you are shorter
        as the last master. (He raises his beer belly.) Or
        Either that or I grew up. look at me
        aside, am I different from you?
ALADDIN: Wait a minute! I'm... your master?
GENIUS: (He places the diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a
        mortar head.) That's right! he can do it
        teach us!! What do you want from me, (like Arnold
        Schwarzenegger) is always surprising, (in a
        bucket) far content (such as ventriloquist
        dummy) repeatedly learns, (pushes dummy aside) .
        but they never copied…

(He outgrows many of the GENE that surrounds him).

The DUP's a little bit . GENIUS: duplicate, duplicate, duplicate.
            duplicate duplicate duplicate
            duplicate, duplicate, duplicate .
GENIUS: (He speaks like a ring announcer at a boxing match).
        Genius! Of! A lamp! (He enters Ed
        Sullivan) Here, right from the lamp, that's right
        here for your great pleasure, to fulfill your desires.
        Thank you uuuu!
ALADDIN: Wow! Do you want to be fulfilled?
GENIUS: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-not
        wanting more desires. (It turns into a lunge
        entering the plane, the hand descends and three GENIUS appear inside
        windows.) Well, three. (Three GENIUSES
        knights out in the open.) Uno, dos, tres.
        (Changing Groucho Marx to black and white.) Nope
        change, exchange or return . (Duck
        comes the secret word "returns".
ALADDIN: (to ABU) Now I know I dreamed.
GENIE: (Music from "Friend Like Me" starts) Master, I don't know
        I think you understand what we have here! SO
        why not ruminate if I shine
        potential. (GENIE is a.
        fluorescent lamparampi).

    Well, Ali Baba had forty thieves
    Scheherazade had a thousand stories
    But use your luck, because you have your work cut out for you
    You have a magic that never ends!

(GENIE unleashes 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords.
    GENIUS appeared in his jacket, reached out and slapped him
    to show thieves.)

    Now you have power in your corner
    Some great ammo in your camp
    You punch, spice, yahoo and whatever
    See, all you have to do is dip this lamp
    And I said, 'I'm sorry

(The boxing ring appears, in ALADD's corner, in the massage room.
    it’s written by GENIUS. And the GENIE turned into a bunch of fire and.
    to explode. Then GENIUS appeared under the lamp and grabbed ALADDIN's lamp.
     rub the lamp with his hand.)

    Nanny Aladdin, nanny
    What is your happiness?
    I'd like to take your order, please write
    You never had a friend like me
    No, no, no, no!

(GENIE sets up the table and chairs and writes things down a
    notepad as server . )

    Life is your kitchen
    And I am your master!
    Come, ask what you want
    You never had a friend like me.

(GENIE appears as a chicken dish and returns to normal,
    but he raises his ears to hear ALADDIN. Finally it explodes
     double in four GENIEs.)

    Yes sir we are proud of our service
    You are the boss, the king, the shah!
    Say what you want, it’s yours! The real food
    How about more Baklava?

(GENITOS provide shaves, haircuts, and manicures, then ALADDIN
    appears in a comfortable chair (eh?) surrounded by treasure
    and happy with women. GENIUS appeared and filled
    serving baklava.)

    Try a short column "A".
    Test the entire column "B".
    I want to help you man
    You never had a friend like me

(ALADDIN standing on dinner column with a large A at top,
    go to the second column with a B at the top. He’s going to fall
    with the pillow held by the GENIE. He opens his mouth,
    and its mouth becomes a staircase. Miniature GENIUS
     dressed as a wizard.)

(The mini GENIE is doing a little dance with the two adult GENIEs
    in his hands. Finally they round up the mini GENIUS and crush
    which is nowhere to be found.)

    Can your friends do it?
    Do your friends do that?
    Will your friends pull this out of a little hat?
    Your friends can go crazy!
    Well, look at this
    Can your friends go to Abracadabra, let them rip
    And then lose this bastard?

(NERO nods, copies, then juggles.
    He throws it at ALADDIN, who juggles it with one arm and spins it
    one end resembles a basketball with a fingertip . He threw it away
     heads back to GENI, who tries to fight
     itself from the base of the hat. It’s round, round and round
     until it becomes a small white powder. Rabbit changes
    purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment at the EPCOT Center).
     The dragon breathes fire into three HAREM GIRLS,
    who dance around ALADDIN. When he began to take them seriously,
     They are lost.)

    So don't just sit there, limp, empty
    I am here to answer all midday prayers
    You kindly got it, proof
    Are you a genius in charge? business!
    I would love to help you
    So I really want to know what you want
    You undoubtedly have a wish three miles away
    So just rub it in, and oh!


(GENIE is similar to what ALADDIN is, and changed
    a certificate that recognizes and surrounds ALADDIN . GENIUS is shaken up
     list {written in Arabic} in ALADDIN's ears, which he wears
    squeeze your butt dry after a shower.)

    Mr. Aladdin, sir, I want two or three
    I'm at work, big mogul
    You never have a friend, you never have a friend
    You never have a friend, you never have a friend
    You never... had... a friend... with... me!
    You never had a friend like me!

(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans down to kiss one of them.
     He turns into a GENIUS who relocates four dancing elephants
    existence. On the other side, he passes four dancing camels,
     and a great back dance number follows . ABU brought back a lot of gold
     as much as he can, but GENIUS gathers everything into a cyclone and.
    hold him until you all return to the cave. GENIUS is a
    a neon "APLAUSES" sign in the background. The ABU turned its hat on and.
    sees it empty.)

GENIE: What will happen, Master?
ALADDIN: Will you grant me three wishes?
GENIE: (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost. There is
        some reservations , some cautions
ALADDIN: How is it?
GENIE: Ah, the first rule: You can't kill anyone. (The
        cuts off his head with his hand.) So don't do it
        ask. Rule number two: I can’t make anyone fall in love
        with another person. (The head becomes a large pair
        lips kisses ALADDIN.) You little punishment, there.
        (Sleeps naked, then stands up and changes
        zombie.) Rule Three: You can't bring people back from here
        off. Not a pretty picture, (He catches it
        ALADDIN then shakes it) I don't like it! (The
        poofs back to normal.) Otherwise
        the!
ALADDIN: (looking at ABU as if making a decision) Ah, reservations? You
        does that mean restrictions? according to their desires? (to ABU) Some of them all
        powerful genius - can't take people back
        off. I don't know, Abu - he probably doesn't know
        get me out of this hole. That’s how we’re going
        I have to find a way out of here…

(They start to walk away, but a giant green foot steps in front of them
    them.)

GENIE: Excuse me? You've seen it
        I? Are you kicking my lamp? Did you wake me up?
        are you bringing me here? And suddenly you are
        are you cheating on me? (Gets angrier and angrier) I
        I don’t think so, not now. You have your own
        wishes, so sit down! (Everyone gets the MAT.
        GENIE is a flight attendant with a lot of stuff
        and the stem representing the exits.) If so
        Emergency, exits here, here, here, .
        aka, aka, aka, aka, aka, aka, aka, aka, aka
        here, somewhere! Put your hands and arms underneath
        rug. Weeee'rrrrrrreee... get out of here!

(MATTO and his passengers run through the desert sand
    far. The value of the int. From the SULTAN's room. JAFAR the
    there with IAGO, JASMINE and SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Jafar, this is a scandal. If it weren't for that
        many years of good and faithful service... . From now on,
        speak to me to judge the prisoners,
        before their heads were cut off.
JAFAR: I assure you, Your Highness, this will not happen again.
SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, let's mess this up now
        business is behind us. Please?
JAFAR: I apologize
        well done, princess. (He kisses her hand, but.
        he ripped it off.)
JASMINE: If I have to, something good will come
        so. When I am a queen, I do
        hard to get away from you.
SULTAN: That’s good. So everything came together. Now Jasmine, .
        returned to this suitor relation, (he
        looks up and sees Jasmine coming out) Jasmine?
        Jasmine is alright! (She runs after him).
JAFAR: I wish I had that lamp!
IAGO: (as Jasmine) I'm strong enough to escape
        You! I see! Mind you - we keep kissing
        until this idiot, and his idiot for his daughter
        the rest of our lives…
JAFAR: No, Iago. Just find an idiot guy.
        Then they'll throw us out... or behead us!
MOLEMAT: ¡Eeewww!
IAGO: (thinking) Oh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
        Jafar is the one? What if you were an idiot guy?
JAFAR: (He looks down at IAGO) What?
IAGO: Well, you're going to marry a princess, okay? Just, uh, .
        you will be the sultan!
JAFAR: Oh! Marrying a mosquito? I will be the Sultan. The idea is as follows
        it’s a nice sight!
IAGO: Yeah, that's enough! If! And then we dragged the stepfather and.
        little woman on the hill! (It's a bomb blanket
        floor) Kersplat!
JAFAR: Iago, I love how your dirty little mind works!

(They both laugh as we walk to an oasis in the desert where MATO is located
    have arrived on the ground.)

GENIE: (Still a flight attendant) Thank you for choosing Magic
        Carpets for all your travel needs. Don't stand up
        until the belt stops completely . (Like
        ALADDIN and ABU descend the ladder they have built
        ENGLISH) Thank you. Goodbye! THANK YOU!
        Bye! (Returns to normal) Come on. What you're saying
        Is that sir, are you waiting for Mustafa?
ALADDIN: Oh, you showed me that well. Now for my three wishes - .
GENIUS: Are my ears deceiving me? Three? You're going to be down
        ¡Wawa!
ALADDIN: Ah, no, I never really wanted to leave
        hole. You’re the only one who’s done it.

(GENIE thinks for a moment, then her coughing slows. She shifts
    lamb.)

GENIE: Well, wasn't I stuck? You've done it well
        baaaaad baby but no more gifts.
ALADDIN: A fair plan. Three wishes, by the way. I wish they were
        OK. (GENIUS) What do you want?

(GENIE hangs like a hammock between two trees).

GENIE: Me? No one has ever asked me that before. Come on, let’s get inside
        Nayan casojaxa, ah, Armasim.
ALADDIN: What? Don't tell me.
GENIUS: Freedom .
ALADDIN: Are you a prisoner?
GENIUS: Everything is part and parcel, the whole concert of genius.
        (Becomes gigantic, voice resonates) Phenomenal cosmic
        strength! (Shrink, narrow in the MAGIC LAMP.)
        Very small living area
ALADDIN: Genius, that's terrible.
GENIE: (Out of the lamp) But oh... to be free. No
        I'm like, "Poof! What do you want? Poof! What do you want?"
        you like Poof! What do you want?” he asked. For my own sake
        master, that would be the greatest of all
        magic and all the treasures in the world! But
        what am I talking about here? Let's be realistic
        here. IT IS NOT THAT. Genius, wake up and.
        you smell like hummus
ALADDIN: Why not?
NERO: Let's just get through it, Daddy
        I want to get out. So you can imagine how often that happens
        pudding.
ALADDIN: I will. I will save you.
GENIE: (Her head becomes Pinocchio's with a wide eye) Hmm
        Well that’s true. Yell!
ALADDIN: Not true, I promise. (He rubs his nose
        and GENIE's brain returns to normal.) After I make mine
        I explain to you my first two wishes and my third
        free. (He raises his hand)
GENIE: Well, I hope so. (He shakes ALADDIN's hand).
        OK Let's do some magic! (Changes
        magician.) What if. what do you want
        most of them than?
ALADDIN: Well, there's this girl...
GENIUS: Ehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIUS's chest is a
        with a heart cross in it.) Wrong! I'm not going to be able to
        make someone fall in love, remember?
ALADDIN: Oh, but Genie. He's smart and funny and.
GENIUS: Beautiful?
ALADDIN: It's great. He has these eyes that are… and
        the hair, wow...and her smile.
GENIUS: (I'm sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and MATO.)
        Am I. It is lovely.
ALADDIN: But she's a princess. For me to have a chance
        I was like... Hey, can you make me a prince?
GENIE: See here. (There's a "royal cookbook" in there.) Um,
        Royal chicken? (There is a chicken a
        crown head) No, Alaskan king crab?
        (He snaps his fingers, and we see SEBASTIAN crab
        "The Mermaid" stuck.) Ouch, me
        I hate it when they do that. The Caesar salad? (A
        (The tick comes out and tries to stab it.) And you,
        Bully? Ah, to make a prince. (He looks fake
        ALADDIN.) Now is this an official wish? You have to say that
        arti!
ALADDIN: Genie, I want to make you a prince!
GENIE: Very nice! ¡That's a great one! (Take a square
        hands and like Arsenio Hall. and the jute
        tailor/fashion designer.) Prior to this Fez
        The bodice combo is still third century. These
        patches - what do we mean - begging? No!
        Let’s work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN
        measure, stitch and ALADDIN's
        dressed in prince costume.) I like it, muy
        macho! Now I want something else. What does it do
        Appointment? It’s about the means of transportation. Excuse
        me, young monkey! Here, then! (ABU tries it
        covers himself with an ALFORMA but it is stolen by GENIE and
        he runs away.)
EXIT: ¡Ay!
GENIE: Here he comes, (played by ALADDIN and GENIE
        exhibition scene where ALADDIN is standing on the podium
        in "AL".) And what better way to do it yourself
        The main entrance to the streets of Agrabah is
        Ride your own new camel! Hear,
        it’s a dance! (A GENIUS head door
        open where ABU becomes a camel . The
        spitting from the side of the mouth, as a signal. But
        GENIE doesn't know.) Mmm, not necessary. (He’s his own
        hands and ABU becomes a beautiful white horse.)
        It's very difficult. Wait and see. What do you need to do?
        (NERO crosses his arms several times and turns away
        ABU in: duck, ostrich, turtle '57
        Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1". (It's here
        I don't think I know cars, but judging from the heart
        flippers, said nuff.) At last he returned
        normal.) Yes!! Esalalumbo, Shimin Dumbo, and more! Wow!!
        (And as the key spell is Dumbo, ABU changes
        like an elephant . ALFORNA is struggling to survive
        under ABU size 46 feet.) Discuss frame
        subscribe, watch this action!

(ABU sees the reflection in the pool of water and jumps into a tree.
     The wood is naturally bent to the ground where ABU
     hangs on and looks up at ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Abu, you're so beautiful.
GENIUS: She has a dress, she has an elephant, though
        we're not ready yet. Hold on to your turban, .
        boy, because we’re going to make you a star!

(We're slowly sinking into the oasis in the distance, like fireflies
    begins to explode outwards. Players hit the CU stack .
    (Look for BEESTS here.) We kneel down and see the SULTAN
    balance them out. He carefully balances the last line, .
     and he sat down and coughed. However, the JAFAR barges and.
    pilax t’unjasi.)

JAFAR: Sir, I have a solution to this problem
        phuchamaxa.
IAGO: Oh! A problem with your daughter!
SULTAN: Oh, really?
JAFAR: (rolls open) Here. “It’s princessy
        did not choose a husband at the appointed time, .
        which the sultan chooses for himself.
SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all the suitors! (He's trying
        putting a cookie in IAGO's mouth. IAGO is supported
        far. SULTAN absent-mindedly pulls out some cookies
        back.) How can I choose someone who hates him?
        (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly a
        makeup on your lips.)
JAFAR: Don't worry, sir. There's more to it than that. When, in
        a case of not finding a suitable prince, princess
        if you get married... hmm... interesting.
SULTAN: What? WHO?
JAFAR: Royal Visor! Well, that would be… me!
SULTAN: Well, I thought the law could be done by a prince alone
        marrying a princess, I know.
JAFAR: Tough times demand desperate measures
        Mr. (He pulls out a stick and hypnotizes her
        SULTAN with it.)
SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...
JAFAR: You ordered the princess to marry me.
SULTAN: I...... command... princess...... (spell
        breaks down temporarily)...but you're too old!
JAFAR: (bringing the wand closer) The princess is getting married
        NAYA!
SULTAN: The princess is married... (fate again
        broken, this time by “Prince
        Ali".) What? What is it? This music! Ha ha ha.
        Jafar, you gotta come see this!

(We watch the parade progress, because it looks like a GENIUS
    the human form is a great example.)

STORIES: Tell Prince Ali!
SWORD: Hello! It’s Prince Ali!
BIG: Hey, clearing the way in the old bazaar,
    Hey you, come on, it's a new shining star,
    Come see her for the first time in your neighborhood!
    Make your way, here it is, .
    Ringing bells, drumming.
    You will love this guy

(MAJOR is mixed with a bunch of different members.)

    Prince Ali, wonder he is, Ali Ababwa!
    Genuine, respectful
    On your knees

(ABU elephant crosses the city with ALADDIN (ALI) turned backwards.)

    Try not to worry too much now
    Improve your salami on Sunday
    And come meet their awesome crew.

(IAGO dances to the music while JAFAR looks at him
    LARGE "wheelbarrows" put six people in the trunk of the ABU. They are standing still
    on each other’s shoulders when ALI shakes hands.)

    Prince Ali, great he, Ali Ababwa!
    As strong as ten ordinary people, in fact
    He ran into a lot of people
    A hundred evils with swords
    Who sent these idiots to their masters, why Prince Ali!

(In ALI, the battery is destroyed, but the GENIE(tm) brand lights up
    crushes the stack and he ends up holding them all in one acrobatic move
     wheel manufacturing. NERO turns into an old man and a baby
    and the last two paragraphs to the audience.)

MALE CHORUS: (Carrying camels) He has seventy-five golden camels!

(Pops here is a typical parade commentator)

HARRY: Aren't they cute, June?

WOMAN'S CHORUS: (on a float) Purple peacock, fifty-three!

(Another commentator arrives).

JUNE: Great Harry, I love feathers!

GENIE: (GENIE exits the screen, a huge balloon of gore descends
            parade) and so on.
    As for exotic mammals
    Does he have a zoo, I tell you
    This is a world class zoo!

(GENIE appears as a leopard, then as a goat, and says the last two words
    lines for two children from the past. We move to the balcony,
    where three HAREM GIRLS are paired with a HAREM GENIE.)

    NERO: 1.1.
        GIRL: (opposite point) .
    Prince Ali, his beauty, Ali Ababwa
        There's no doubt that Ali is gorgeous
    This physics, how to pronounce it
        Never ordinary, never boring
    Weak knees
        Everything about this man is fascinating
    Well come on over here
        He’s a miracle, he’s a genius, a miracle
    Adjust your sails and get ready
        He broke my heart
    Falcon, crawl and watch Prince Ali!
        And I love her outfit!

(JASMINE looks out from the balcony of the palace. She.
    he leaves, and then leaves.)

CHORUS: He has ninety-five white Persian monkeys!
    (He has monkeys, See Monkeys!)
    And it doesn’t cost anything to take care of them!
    (He is generous, so generous)
    He has slaves, slaves and helpers!
    (It's an honor to work for him)
    They bow to his whims, they want to serve him
    They are just assholes about their loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali it is!

(ALADDIN throws gold coins at the crowd hurrying towards him
    Pick them up. ABU and parade up the steps
    palace and interior. THE SULTAN runs to the door
    towards the throne room, but JAFAR is standing in front of the door.
    It suddenly opened up under the leadership of the ABU and seriously
     JAFAR and IAGO are behind the door.)

GENIUS: Prince Ali!
    With love for him! Ali Ababwa
    I hear your princess is a lovely sight!
    And so, folks,
    He got dressed and left
    Sixty elephants, llamas galore
    Osonakapampi, leonanakapampi
    Marching band
    With forty fakirs, a cook and a baker
    Their birds are chirping on one side
    Make way for Prince Ali!

(More cheers until ALADDIN flees on ABU's back.
    run to the MAGIC CRPET mat and towards the SULTAN. JAFAR is accused
     closed door.)

SULTAN: (applause) It's amazing, it's really interesting.
ALADDIN: (draws a deeper voice.) Ahem. Your Majesty, I am
            I came from afar to seek your daughter’s hand.
SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa! Of course. I'm satisfied
        to meet with you. (She rushes over and shakes ALI's hand).
        This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He’s happy to be there
        Also.
JAFAR: (Very dry) Ecstatic. I was afraid, prince
        Aboubou-- and so on.
ALADDIN: --Dogs!
JAFAR: It doesn’t matter. I can't push this without being asked
        and I'm waiting...
SULTAN: ...Allah, this is truly an amazing device.
        (She throws pom poms, and they are hers
        mustache.) I don't think I.
ALADDIN: Of course, your majesty. I can.

(He helps SULTAN to MAT and he falls.
    JAFAR pins MAT to the ground with a stick.)

JAFAR: Sir, I advise you not to.
SULTANI: -- You push the button, Jafar. Learn to have some fun.

(He shakes the stick and MATO and SULTAN run away. IAGO, who
    stood at the end of a stick, fell several times
     stroke with the tip of the stick as it descends. SULTAN and.
    MATO runs high to the ceiling and attacks with a bomb,
     ABU ran inside scaring him off. The flight continues
    in the background with JAFAR and ALI speaking in the foreground.)

JAFAR: Where do you say?
ALADDIN: Oh, you've been fast, I'm sure.
        (He smiles. JAFAR doesn't).
JAFAR: Please try me. (IAGO lands on the stick.)
SULTAN: Look, Polly!

(Everyone falls back in time as GURSU grows green inches above his head).
    heads of state. THE WORM returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO into the room.)

IAGO: Hey, look at this. Look at him with that stupid rug!

(MATTO zooms in below IAGO, he coughs, wipes his forehead and.
    leans against a pole. He hits the ground and his head
    it's surrounded by miniature SULTANS on RUGS that say "Take a crack,
    there are cookies. The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)

SULTAN: Off, I'm coming down. Jafar , 1999 .
        Look at the guys! (It's going down).
JAFAR: Very impressive, Your Highness.
SULTAN: Oh, very strange. Yes, I feel like I have a gift
        the. (ALFORMA goes in a daze towards ABU
        fill. ABU caught him.) That's okay
        impressionable youth. And the prince too. (Noise
        To JAFAR) If we're lucky, we won't have to get married
        Jasmine after all.
JAFAR: I don't trust him, sir.
SULTAN: This is absurd. One thing I'm proud of, Jafar, I'm proud of
        a good judge of man.
IAGO: Oh, good judge, yes, of course... no!!!

(JASMINE quietly enters).

SULTAN: Jasmine likes this!
ALADDIN: And I'm already in love with princess Jasmine!
JAFAR: Your Highness. I pray for Jasmine
        in the name of the. (JASMINE She gets angry.) So
        the boy is no different from the others. Whoever does it
        does he think she’s fit for a princess?
ALADDIN: Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He injects
        JAFAR'S goatee is flexed in all directions
        instructions.) Let him contact me. I'm winning
        ¡phuchama!
JASMINE: How dare you! (Everyone looks surprised).
        Have you all decided the future? I
        I am not going to win an award! (He rushes out).
SULTANI: Oh my Goddess. Don't worry, Prince Ali. You just have to give it away
        It's time for Jasmine to freshen up. (They’re out).
JAFAR: I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince
        Aboubou and others .

(Ask JASMINE on her balcony at night. We found her on our knees
    ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)

ALADDIN: What am I supposed to do? Jasmine hasn't left me either
        i should have known that talking to him wasn't an argument
        at the will of the foolish prince. (ABU is struggling
        elephant's feet to open a banana . He's shaking it up
        and a banana exploded in his eyes. Then he’s
        throw the banana peel together
        but.)
GENIE: (on the carpet, playing chess) So! (MATTO does the same,
        drop the black line from the board.) Hello.
        That’s a good idea. (as Rodney Dangerfield) I
        I can’t believe I’m losing all-in.
ALADDIN: Genius, I need help.
GENIUS: (as Jack Nicholson) Well, Sparky, here we are
        decision. If you want to piss off a little lady, you have to do it
        A fair fighter, can you follow me?
ALADDIN: What?
GENIE: (Back to normal, holding grenade launcher. He points
        write his words on the board) Tell him
        get out!!!
ALADDIN: That's not it! If only Jasmine knew who I really was
        dirty street rat, he laughs at me. (The
        wears a turban, which shines like a GENIUS.)
GENIUS: A woman appreciates a man who makes her laugh!
        (ALADDIN removes the chain and turns on the lights.
        GENIUS comes out with a real turban.) Al, everyone
        joking aside, you really have to behave yourself.
ALADDIN: Hey, that's the last thing. Light,
        I’m going to see him. I am sweet, cold, .
        sure. How do you look like?
GENIE: (Sadly) Like a prince.

(ALADDIN runs to the balcony WITH THE SHEEP. JASMINE is in bed,
    sigh. RAJAH is on his side.)

ALADDIN: (Jan wali jaya) ¿Princesa Jasmine?

(The RAJAH looks up and sighs).

JASMINE: Is there anyone there?
ALADDIN: Hello, Prince Ali. Ahem--(And he jumped into his own
        inner voice) prince Ali Ababwa.
JASMINE: I don't want to see you.
ALADDIN: No, no, please, princess. Give me a chance. (RAJAH is a man
        grunted and walked over to him.)
JAFAR: Leave me alone.
ALADDIN: Come down!

(On the other side of the balcony is the ALFORMA looking down and the GENIE below).

GENIE: How is our friend?

(ALFORMA cuts her throat with her hand).

ALADDIN: Good cat, take it. Kitten down to the bottom . (He's leaving
        his turban to expel the RAJAH.)
JASMINE: (She looks at him and thinks she sees him)
        first.) Wait, wait. Do I know you, guys?
ALADDIN: (changing his turban quickly) No, no.
JASMINE: You remind me of the man I met at the market.
ALADDIN: The market? (A bee buzzes around his head).
        I have servants who market for me.
        Why do I have servants who go to the market?
        to my servants, so I cannot have you
        face.
JASMINE: (Empty look.) No, I don't think so.
BEE: (to NERO) Enough for you, Casanova. Talk
        ¡from him! He's smart, funny, hair, eyes.
        What: choose a feature!
ALADDIN: Oh, Princess Jasmine, huh? You're still.
BEE: Lovely, great, amazing, spot on!
ALADDIN: Of course!
JASMINE: On time?
BEE: That's right.
ALADDIN: Wali jach'awa.
BEE: Good solution.
JASMINE: That's a little bit. I’m rich, you know.
ALADDIN: Come on!
JASMINE: The Sultan's daughter
ALADDIN: I know.
JASMINE: A huge sum for any prince wedding.
ALADDIN: That's true. ADEQUATE. A prince like me.
BEE: (whispering in his ear) Be careful! Communication!
JASMINE: That's right, a prince like you. And all the other hoodies,
             proud, that peacock you know!
ABJE: (Fires again, puts on glasses and falls) Mayday!
              ¡Autonaka!
JASMINE: Go jump off the balcony! (He turns and leaves) .
ALADDIN: What?
BEE: Stop him! Stop him, please! Would you like to push him?
ALADDIN: (He hits the bee) Wrong!
BEE: Well, it’s fine. But remember: just be yourself! (The bee stings
             turbantepa) .
ALADDIN: Yes, of course!
JASMINE: What!?!
ALADDIN: Er, you're right. You are not a prize
        won. (He looks disappointed.) You must be free
        you have to choose yourself. (JASMINE and RAJAH look on
        look at each other confused.) I'm going now. (The
        then climb the hill and climb down.)
JASMINE: No!
ALADDIN: (shakes his head) What? What?
JASMINE: (Shocked) How -- how do you do that?
        (He looks up and sees an ALFORMA).
ALADDIN: The flying carpet.
JASMINE: That's great. (ALFORMA takes JASMINE's hand a
        glans.)
ALADDIN: You, uh, don't want to ride one, do you?
        We can see the world out of the palace.
JASMINE: Is it safe?
ALADDIN: Of course. Can you trust me?
JASMINE: (She says all this and looks at him...
        important line) What?
ALADDIN: (Stretching out his hand as before) You can trust me
        NAYA?
JASMINE: (she smiles) Yeah.

(He takes her hand and climbs the SHELTER. Zooms into the sky,
    putting them both on their seats. Music "One Everything".
     A new world" blows. JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH watching her
    she looked at him questioningly. She smiles as they run over the palace
     on the wall and in the sky.)

ALADDIN: I can show you the world
    Brilliant, shining, great.
    Princess, tell me when was the last time you visited
    Should your heart decide?

(ALFORMA zooms through town, pausing a
    flower. He gives ALADDIN the flower, she gives it to JASMINE.
      He smiles.)

    I can open my eyes
    You will be amazed at this miracle
    Top, side and bottom
    On a running carpet


(ALFORMA acts as ALADDIN sings and then magnifies the clouds).

    A new world!
    A great new look
    No one is saying no to me
    Or wherever you go
    Or imagine that you are dreaming

(SMILE Looks back and sees Agrabah disappear from sight. WORM
    running in and out of the clouds.)

JASMINE: A new era
    It's a dazzling fact I've never known
    But when you're up there
    It’s crystal clear
    I’m in a whole new world with you now!

ALADDIN: I'm in a whole new world with you now!

(They both get a small cloud as the ALFORMA continues to fly. He.
    the cloud surrounds the statue so that it appears circular.)

JASMINE: amazing images
    An unspeakable feeling
    Hovering, spinning, roaming free
    Amid the endless diamond sky

(They join the flock of birds in the sky. One looks horrified.
    and shouts. MATTO makes leaps and bounds, sometimes falling
    ALADDIN and JASMINE are in free fall, but they are caught. They
    magnify above the clouds where the starry night awaits.)

JASMINE: A whole new world!
ALADDIN: Don't you dare open your eyes
JASMINE: There are a hundred thousand different things to see
ALADDIN: Hold your breath, it's going to get better!
JASMINE: I feel like a shooting star,
    I have come this far
    I can't go back to where I was!

(They run over a river, apparently the Nile, because they run behind it
     the sails of the ship are the great pyramid. They greet the worker
     covering the entire forehead of the sphinx. He smiles, though
    too much to chisel and break the nose.)

ALADDIN: A New World!
JASMINE: Every tour is a surprise
ALADDIN: New horizons to pursue
JASMINE: Kuna minute, wila lyrics

(They run to the galloping wild horses. JASMINE waves at one of them).

BOTH: I'll follow them somewhere
    There is time to waste
    Let me share this whole new world with you

    A new era
    This is where we’ll be

(They go to Greece, where ALADDIN buys the apple a
    tree and swings his arm towards JASMINE who is now safe
    he is dealing with ALADDIN, not Prince ALI.)

ALADDIN: That's funny
JASMINE: Great place
PANI: For you and me!

(A CARPETS are floating on the lake, and we see a reflection
    the moon in the middle of the sea. Fireworks exploded and we saw a couple
    during Chinese New Year celebrations, sitting on the roof.)

JASMINE: It’s so magical.
ALADDIN: Yes.
JASMINE: (Looks at him and decides to burst the bubble)
        Too bad Abu has to miss this one.
ALADDIN: No, he hates fireworks. (TAPIT raises his head
        he realizes what is going on.) He really doesn't
        running around. (And now ALADDIN understands)
        It’s… oh no!
JASMINE: (takes off her turban) You're a boy
        walk! I know that's it. Why did you lie to me?
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I'm sorry.
JASMINE: You thought I was stupid?
ALADDIN: No!
JASMINE: I don't think so?
ALADDIN: No, I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't. It’s not like that
        what I meant to say.
JASMIN: Who are you? Speak the truth!
ALADDIN: Really? (He looks at GUSURU, who gestured,
        giving up all hope.) The truth...the truth...is me
        sometimes they wear plain clothes to escape
        the problems of palace life. (MATTO CONFIDENTS
        defeat.) But of course I am a prince! (Pen on and below
         his turban pulled over his eyes.)
JASMINE: Why didn't you tell me?
ALADDIN: Well, you know, uh... the king is going
        the city in disguise, looking somewhat strange, .
        do you not believe?
JASMINE: Not so much.

(He picks up a feather and rubs it at her. THE WORM a
    the pom pom is under the "chin" and represents a mystery. Darkening the outside.
    from the palace balcony where ALADDIN and JASMINE return. RUG
    a ladder appears and descends. Then ALADDIN descended
     right under the balcony.)

JASMINE: Goodnight, handsome prince.
ALADDIN: Sleep well, princess.

(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but MATO collides with him and they
    kiss her earlier than expected. He goes slowly, then turns around and.
    Look at him, guys. Finally, he enters the room through the curtain.)

ALADDIN: Yeah! (He goes back to the ALFORMA, which is on the ground
        on the ground.) For the first time in my life
        things are starting to go well.

(Four pairs of hands grasp Jasmine's balcony).

ALADDIN: Good morning! What? (A diaper is tied to his mouth.
        Muffled voice) Abu! Abu! (We see an elephant
        suspended from a net attached to a tree.)
WARNING: Hold your breath!

(With chains on his legs and arms. Another EXAMPLE
    ALFORMA is knotted around the tree.)

JAFAR: I'm afraid you're welcome, Prince
        Aboubou and others . (He goes away.) He is
        was never found.

(He hits a GUARD on the head and knocks him unconscious. Cut to a
    on the cliff where the RULES laugh as ALADDIN's body falls into the water.
      He is conscious now, but his foot is tied to a rock. Rock
     hits the bottom of the sea, the qunt'asis turban descends and the lamp falls
    out ukat juk'ampinaka. He sees this and tries to rub the lamp. However, he ukat juk'ampinaka
    loses consciousness and falls to the ground. Lamp, unstable ukat juk'ampinaka
    spins and rubs his hands as he moves. It trembles, ukat juk'ampinaka.
    ja GENIUS tulee esiin kylpyharjan, kumiankan ja suihkumyssyn kanssa).

GENIUS: Älä koskaan epäonnistu . This kylvyssä ja se and kitkaa
        a lamp. (duck quack) Hi. (see) sasaw sapxi
        ALADDIN unconscious) Al? ¡Al! ¡Child, stop!
        ¡Ukat can cheat this! I can not help you
        ellet tee sneakers . But the father said, "Nero, minä.
        I want you to save my life." Do you understand? Okay. Come on
        Aladdin is the one!! (He grabs ALADDIN by the arms and.
        shake him off. His head rises and then falls.) Me
        accept that as a yes. (Head becomes a mermaid).
        Wow! Wow! (It turned into a deep ship).
        scope! (He laughs at what he hears
        German language. There's a large water nozzle at the top
        out and lands on a rock. The name of ALADDIN
        wakes up and coughs up water from the lungs.)
        Don’t be so scared!
ALADDIN: Genie, I--uh, I-uh... (She doesn't know what to say
        and they kiss.) Thanks, Genie.
GENIUS: Oh Al. I’m starting to like you, boy. No
        saying you want to choose curtains or something.

(Cut to JASMINE in her room, dancing to "A Whole New World" and brushing her teeth
   his hair is slow. THE SULTAN appears in one of the double doors, hypnotized.)

SULTANI: ¡Jasmine!
JASMINE: Oh daddy, I just had the most amazing time.
        I’m so happy to be here.
SULTAN: (Very monotone under hypnosis) You must be,
        Jasmine was like that. I have chosen a man for you.
JASMINE: What about you?
SULTAN: (Another door opens to reveal JAFAR.) You do
        to marry Jafar.

(JASMINE smiles at this).

JAFAR: You are speechless, I see. Summary summary a
        hate
JASMINE: I'll never marry you. (He goes to the SULTAN)
        Dad, I chose Prince Ali!
JAFAR: Prince Ali is gone!

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in front of the balcony door).

ALADDIN: You better read your crystal ball again, Jafar!
JASMINE: Prince Ali!

(JAFAR smiles at ALADDIN).

IAGO: How the hell... (back to the parrot)... uh, awk!
ALADDIN: Tell them the truth, Jafar! You tried to get me
        kill.
JAFAR: What is it? (He goes to the SULTAN) Laughter
        This is absurd, Your Highness. He's clearly lying.
        (He brings the stick closer to the SULTAN's face.)
SULTAN: Apparently... lying.

(ALADDIN sees the wand with glowing eyes).

JASMINE: Dad, what's wrong with you?
ALADDIN: ¡Nayajj yattwa!

(ALADDIN grabs the staff and sticks it to the ground. JAFAR jumps.
    and the spell was permanently broken.)

SULTAN: ¡Ay, ay, ay, ¡Diosaja!
ALADDIN: Your highness, Jafar rules him
        This! (He brings the stick forward) .
SULTAN: What? Jafar is the one? You are a traitor!

(Three people lead JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Your Majesty, all of this can be explained.
SULTAN: ¡Guardanaka! ¡Guardanaka!
IAGO: Well, that's all, we're dead, forget it. Each
        dig us both a grave. They were already dead.

(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket. He makes a move, but.
    guardianakajj katjapjjänwa.)

SULTAN: Arrest Jafar immediately.
JAFAR: Not done yet, baby!

(JAFAR takes a bottle from his pocket. ALADDIN sees it and hurries away
    him, but JAFAR threw the bottle on the ground. A big red cloud
    will appear. When he’s gone, so is JAFAR.)

SULTAN: Find it now, search everywhere!
ALADDIN: Jasmine, are you alright?
JASMINE: Yeah.

(They sit down to kiss, but SULTANI comes between them).

SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted adviser, is on the verge of retaliation
        me all the time. It’s just terrible. How can I ever - .
        (He stops mid-sentence and looks at the two men).
        Could that be true? My daughter ended up choosing one
        pretender to the right? (He shakes his head) Ha ha! Praise be to Allah! You
        big boy I can kiss you! I don't - I won't
        leave me alone.... You got married at the same time!
        Yes Yes. And you will be happy and prosperous, and.
        then my son, you will be my sultan!
ALADDIN: The Sultan?
SULTAN: Yes, a brave and honest young man like you, a
        a man of impeccable moral character
        just what this kingdom needs! (ALADDIN points out
        worried about it.)

(Cut to JAFAR's apartments. JAFAR and IAGO enter.)

IAGO: We gotta get out of here! We have to find out... I have to find out
        Start packing, Your Highness. Only the most important things.
        (IAGO starts throwing things out of the cage.
        JAFAR smiles broadly.) Travel light! Bring him to me
        gun, pistol, knife (stands and goes
        his photo and JAFAR) and what
        This picture? I don't know - I think I should do one
        strange face there. (JAFAR starts laughing wildly)
        Oh boy, did he go crazy. It's broken. (IAGO) (IAGO)
        ran up to him and hit him on the head.) Jafar?
        Jafar is the one? Throw yourself down, Jafar! (JAFAR is everywhere
        neck) Good grip!
JAFAR: Prince Ali is nothing but this kid wearing rags
        Aladdin is a brother. He has a lamp, Iago.
IAGO: Why not.
JAFAR: But you can get away with it!
Iago: Me, right?

(Cut to outside the palace. ALADDIN is looking out over the gardens).

ALADDIN: The Sultan? Do they want me to be their sultan?

(GENIE comes out of the lamp)

GENIE: Huzzah! Hail the winner! (Changes
        a one man band. He sees ALADDIN walking with him
        head upwards. He stops, shakes his head, arrives
        with this idea and expanding it into ALADDIN . He has
        he raises his hand like a director framing a film and
        we'll go through them.) Aladdin, you've just won
        princess heart What can you do
        to follow up? (ALADDIN looks at him and walks away
        on the bed of sorrow where he breaks down and cries.
        The GENIE regained consciousness, then swung towards him and killed the snowman
        the script is called "Aladdin". Noise :)
        Psst, the phrase "liberate genien".
        Whenever.
ALADDIN: Genius... I don't.
GENIE: Of course you do. You just say “Genius, I need you
        free." (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses it
        him as a mock ventriloquist puppet . ALADDIN is far away.)
ALADDIN: I'm still thinking. I’m sorry, I really am. But
        they wanted to make me a sultan - no!, they wanted to make me
        Prince Ali Sultan . Without you I am Aladdin.
GENIE: Al, you win!
ALADDIN: Because of you! The only reason people think that of me
        all because of you. And if they knew that
        Am I really a prince? (Calmly) How can it be done
        Does Jasmine know this? I am taking it away. Genius, I can’t do that
        keep it myself. I don't want you to be free.
GENIE: (Sarcastic) Hey, I see. However,
        you are lying to everyone. Hi, I'm starting out
        Feel like you haven’t been abandoned. Now if you will forgive me,
        consider. (And the last word is spoken in anger
        bean bags back to the lamp.)

(ABU and CARPET look out the window).

ABU: Ohhoh: That's a great example.
ALADDIN: Genie, I'm so sorry. (The word comes out
        sucker and raspberries for her.) Well, it's nice. (He snorts
        pillow over the LAMP.) Just stay inside
        there! (Looks at ABU and MATO.) What are you doing?
        how many of you are watching? (They both leave.) Look, I am
        I'm sorry. Wait, Abu... wait... Sorry, no...
        wait come (He sighed.) What shall I do?
        Genie is right: I have to tell Jasmine the truth.
JASMINE: (from a distance) Ali, oh Ali, are you coming here?
ALADDIN: (puts on turban) Well then. (He's walking around
        in the garden.) Jasmine? Where are you?

(We see IAGO wearing his cape, and standing on sections of wood near the FLAMINGO
    in the pond. He imitates JASMINE's voice.)

IAGO: Huh... Make it quick on the Menager.
ALADDIN: I'm coming.

(We see ALADDIN rushing past, not seeing the birds. IAGO laughs,
    then turns around and faces the FLAMINGO, which
    pant.)

FLAMINGO: ¡Uh!
IAGO: What's wrong, pinky? (He cleaned the bird
        the legs protrude from the bottom. IAGO runs into the palace
        and finds a lamp under the pillow.) Boy, Jafarin
        Glad to see you! (he rubs his face
        looks like JAFAR and learns.) Good job, Iago!
        (Normal) Ah, go ahead. (JAFAR) No, of course, to scale
        from one to ten, you are eleven! (Normal) Ah, that's it.
        Jafar, you are so kind. I'm shy, I'm shy
        blush in a few moments . (He ran the lamp).

(Cut to entering the palace. The SULTAN stands at the top and does
    telling the people.)

SULTAN: People of Agrabah, my daughter is at last a.
        cossie sister!

(Cut to behind the curtain where JASMINE is watching. ALADDIN
    can be seen at the bottom of the stairs.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine?
JASMINE: Ali, where did you go?
ALADDIN: I have something to tell you.
JASMINE: The whole kingdom goes back to the father
        ad!
ALADDIN: No! But Jasmine, listen to me!
JASMINE: Good luck! (He threw up on stage
        With the SULTAN, where he sees all
        many.)
SULTAIN: ...He's a Dog!
ALADDIN: Oh, wow!

(At the top, IAGO and JAFAR look out the window).

IAGO: Look at them, they're shaking the little whiner.
JAFAR: Let them applaud.

 (He picks up the lamp and shakes it. The GENIUS comes out).

GENIUS: You know Al, I got it (turns around and sees JAFAR)
        really yyyyy -- I don't know her. (The
        goes down and asks for the poster.) Tonight
        Ali's role is heavy, dark and.
        darkness of the evil man.
JAFAR: I am now your master. (He threw GENIUS
        on the ground and puts his foot in the face of the GENIUS.)
GENIE: I was afraid of that.
JAFAR: Genie, grant me my first wish. I want to remember
        high up, like a sultan!!!

(Cut to where the dark clouds surround the castle. The castle trembles.
    The roof cracks and the SULTAN and ALADDIN crash into each other.)

ALADDIN: ¡Waw!
SULTAN: Bless my soul. What is this? What’s going on?

(His turban takes off his head. When he catches it, it's his whole body
    run and then take off all their clothes except their boxers
     shorts are available. The dresses have reappeared in JAFAR.)

JAFAR: ¡Ey hey hey!
SULTAN: Jafar, you vile traitor.
IAGO: For you, Sultan Vile Traitor.
ALADDIN: Oh, huh? Well, let’s see! (animated) character
        takes the same turban, but finds it empty) Lamp!
JAFAR: Interrogator- viewers, Abooboo.

(They both look up and see a giant GENIUS flying into the palace
    clouds... ALADDIN whistles and ALFORMA runs to greet him.
      They fly right next to GENI's head.)

ALADDIN: He's a bastard! No!
GENIE: Sorry, kid, I have a new boss now. (He's set
        a palace on a hill.)
SULTAN: Jafar, I must leave you alone!
JAFAR: Now there is a new order: my order! Finally, you
        !

(SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not).

JAFAR: We will never bow down to you!
IAGO: Why wasn't I surprised?
JAFAR: If you would not bow to the Sultan, you would
        kneel before the witch! (GENIUS) Genius, mine
        second wish - I want to be more active
        the wizard of the world!

(GENIE waves. ALADDIN tries to stop him, but fails,
    and the lightning of another GENIE(tm) is JAFAR,
     to restore its normal shape).

IAGO: Brothers and sisters, welcome to Agrabah
        The old Jafar!
JAFAR: Where are you now? Ah yes, a great understatement!
        (He hits JASMINE and SULTAN with a stick, and.
        and they both bowed down before him. RAJAH rushes towards him.
        He hits RAJAH and the tiger turns into a kitten.
        cat.) Up, baby! Oh princess... (raises chin
        with his team) - who I would die for
        you have to fulfill it.
ALADDIN: (off camera) Jafar! Don't touch it!

(JAFAR steals ALADDIN. IT runs away.)

JAFAR: Prince Ali
    yes he is
    But not as you know.
    Read my lips and understand
    Really

(JAFAR brings them both together in the air).

    Yes, meet a blast from your past
    Whose lies were so good, they didn't last forever
    Hail Prince Ali!

(JAFAR takes ALI back to ALADDIN.)

IAGO: Or should I say Aladdin?
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I tried to tell you.

JAFAR: So Ali was Aladdin
    As a scam, continue?
    Believe me
    His character flaw
    Give me a good reason
    Send him packing with a one-way ticket
    So their future prospects are forever under threat
    His stuff is frozen, the location is selected
    It’s the end of the world, oops!
    Goodbye,
IAGO: Goodbye, see you soon!
JAFAR: Old Prince Ali!

(JAFAR returns ABU to normal. He sends them both...
    heavy pillar, and throw it like a rocket, but don't launch it nose
    MATO enters F2B, and we see a blank wasteland, somewhere
    the pillar collapses and falls. Finally it stopped .
    ALADDIN steps out, visibly cool.)

ALADDIN: Abu? Abu! (He looks at the shaking pile
        snow.) Oh, this is all my fault - I must have
        I let loose my genes when I could. (He's digging
        He took ABU out and shook his jacket.) Abu!
        Do you agree with me? I'm Abu, I'm dirty
        everything, one way or another. I'll have to go back and settle down
        things are very nice. (He starts walking through the snow,
        and he ends up walking on a frozen ALFORMA.)
        Rug! (He looks up and sees the ALFORMA covered
        pillar. He's fighting to try and save ALFORMA . The
        he can't do that, so he starts shoveling snow
        base of the pillar.) Abu, begin to recognize! is
        the! (The potatoes were eventually widely cultivated and.
        the pillar begins to rotate. ALADDIN survives, .
        looks back and then sits down. Pilar is called
        back to him, and when he's gone ALADDIN and
        ABU allowed him to sit in the layer of snow he had created
        pillar window.) Yes! Light! (The
        Looks at the turban made out of fear of the ABU.
        MATTO shakes his wings and runs to pick it up
        pick them up.) Now, back to Agrabah! Let’s go!

(We turn to the giant picture of Agrabah, obscured by red clouds.
    The value of the int. zooming slowly through the throne room. IAGO TO THE SULTAN
    tied up like a doll, and JASMINE chained at her side
    to the throne.)

IAGO: Does the puppet master want some cookies? These are cookies.
        Throw it all down your throat. Here’s the existing one
        mä box!

(JAFAR removes the chain and JASMINE approaches with an apple).

JAFAR: Leave him alone!

(IAGO pauses, then continues).

JAFAR: I think it’s so sad you become this person, Jasmine.
        (He bites the apple he is holding).
        A beautiful desert flower, as you should be
        at the hands of the greatest man in the world.
        (He raises his hand and the crown appears.) What are you doing?
        you say honey Why, when the queen.

(Takes a glass of wine and throws it in his face).

JASMINE: Absolutely!
JAFAR: I want to teach respect! (He as he pulls back
        reaching out to hit him. Then he stands up.) Nope.
        Genius, I decided to do my last wish. I
        i hope princess jazmine is weak
        love with me

(We see ALADDIN running back to town).

GENIE: (again impersonating Buckley) Ah, Master... there are a few
        additions, notes
JAFAR: Don't answer me, you stupid green man! You
        I'll do what I say, slave!

(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN waving at her window
    play at the same time.)

JASMINE: (She gets up and puts the crown on her head).
        Jafar is a country! I never realized how amazing that was
        you are beautiful.

(Slap of NERO).

JAFAR: That's better. (He put GENIUS's chin on a.
        shadow.) Now, Kitty, tell me more
        let’s talk about me.
JASMINE: You're tall, well dressed...

(JAFAR approaches him. ALADDIN jumps in with ABU and GENI
    can see them.)

GENIE: Al! Al, jisk'a friend!
ALADDIN: ¡Shh!
GENIE: (He actually opens and closes his mouth).
        Al, I can't help you. I work for a psychopath .
        NOW. (His head becomes JAFAR and back).
ALADDIN: Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? (He rips off the GENI
        mouth.) I’m going to improvise.

(He tosses a pile of coins and hides near JAFAR and JASMINE.
    JAFAR turns his back on ALADDIN.)

JAFAR: Jatka and so on.
JASMINE: And your beard is... well... curly! (He’s got it
        his arm wraps around her. He pretends they’re turning with him
        finger, but actually waves at ALADDIN
        Below. He makes his walk. IAGO observes.)

IAGO: Gag--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth).
JAFAR: What's a street rat?
JASMINE: Any street rats?

(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to hit the pot. JAFAR
    he turns to look, but JASMINE catches him and kisses him. The name of ALADDIN
     his appearance is disgusting. (IAGO and ABU look angry).

ABU: It’s fun!
JAFAR: It's... (he sees the reflection of ALADDIN in him
        crown.) You!! How many times have I
        the child to kill you?

 (Steals ALADDIN away. JASMINE falls towards him
    below. ALADDIN quickly grabs the stick.)

ALADDIN: Take the lamp!

(JASMINE runs towards him. But JAFAR shoves ALADDIN away
    put it on an hourglass.)

JAFAR: Ah, ah, ah, princess - Your time is up!

(Sand starts falling on him from the sky).

ALADDIN: Jasmine!
IAGO: Oh, good luck, Jaf... (He's knocked out of ABU.)

(ABU runs towards the lamp).

JAFAR: Don't play with me! (He becomes a toy monkey.
ALADDIN: ¡Abu!


(TAPIT arrives soon.)

JAFAR: Things are moving fast now, kid. (The ALFORMA is.
        suppressed and suppressed. ALADDIN rushes towards it
        lamp.) Do you understand? (His path is blocked
        great swords stuck in the ground. JAFAR has taken over
        the lamp and the laughter are frightening. ALADDIN is a
        sword out of the ground.) I'm just warming up
        above! (He spits the Ring of Fire around ALADDIN.)
ALADDIN: Are you afraid to fight me about yourself, coward
        Qatari?
JAFAR: Snake, right? You might want to see how
        I would look like a snake! (He still smiles, and we.
        I saw a snake come out from behind its mouth
        teeth. Then it turned into a giant cobra and.
        The ring of fire near ALADDIN is a fact
        a snake coils around ALADDIN. The snake is designed by JAFAR
        Moves to ALADDIN and tries ALADDIN on the third
        sword strikes and hits JAFAR. It’s called GENIUS
        cheerleaders wearing A-line sweaters.)

GENIUS: Rickem, rockem, racem, rake - stick with the sword
        Aka Katari!
JAFAR: Get away from it!

(GENIE points to a small pennant with a “J” on it.)

GENIUS: (weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man - if he can't,
        THE GLORIES ARE!

(ALADDIN takes advantage of the distraction for the hourglass to make a break where.
    JASMINE is in a state of shock. However, JAFAR notices and blocks the way.
     ALADDIN falls and loses his sword.)

JASMINE: Aladdin!

(ALADDIN jumps on a giant jewel and throws it to the ground, catching it
    sword in the way. He rounds the corner, but snakes to the chase
    can't do it, and JAFAR's forehead sticks through the wall and
    hanging outside the palace. ALADDIN jumped on the snake
     and stabbed him to death. JAFAR screamed in agony. ALADDIN tries again
     rescue the princess.)

ALADDIN: ¡Suyt’am, Jasmine!

(He's about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him).

JAFAR: (laughs evilly) You little fool! You’re right
        you can defeat the strongest animal on the planet!
IAGO: (GENIUS is coming up behind him) Fuck him, .
        Jafar – It’s like – awk! (GENIE shakes him off
        to get out of the way) .
JAFAR: Without genius, my son, you are nothing!
ALADDIN: (thinkingly) Black! Black! Black
        be stronger than you will ever be!
JAFAR: What!!
ALADDIN: He gave me your power, he can take it back from you!
GENIE: Al, what are you doing? Why did you bring me
        inside the ?
ALADDIN: Believe me, Jafar: you're still just a stopgap!
JAFAR: You’re right! His power is stronger than mine! But
        it doesn’t last long!

(JAFAR rotates around GENIUS).

GENIUS: This guy is crazy. He's a little drunk. A
        too many fights with snakes (hands
        turns into a snake and hits him on the head with it.)
JAFAR: Slave, I make my third wish! I want to be whole
        mighty genius!
GENIE: (reluctantly) Well, your will is my command.
        Suma lurtatawa, Al.

(GENIE defeats JAFAR with the GENIE (tm) branded final flash.
    JAFAR's snake form dissolves and he becomes a spirit. We
     Watch JASMINE's long arm disappear into the sand. The name of ALADDIN
    collapses and finally the glass breaks. Sand and the princess
     to the landfill.)

JAFAR: Yeah! If! Can! Absolute power!
JASMINE: (to ALADDIN) What have you done?
ALADDIN: Believe me!

(A blue lamp appears at JAFAR's base. JAFAR cast a spell).

JAFAR: The universe is mine, I command it, I control it!
ALADDIN: Don't worry, Jafar! Are you forgetting something?
    (JAFAR looks at him questioningly) You want to be a genius, you
    I understand! And everything that goes with it!

(Chains on JAFAR's wrists).

JAFAR: No! No!
IAGO: I'm leaving! Come on, you’re right
        genius, I don’t want to…

(IAGO tries to run, but is caught by JAFAR.)

ALADDIN: Phenomenal Cosmic Powers! Very small living area.
GENIUS: Al, you little genius, you!

(ABU returns to normal, MATO rises to the surface, JASMINE, SULTAN
    and RAJAH join together. RAJAH jumped on his shoulder
     SULTANIA, so everyone changes. THE SULTAN is very difficult
     there is the weight of the new RAJAH. The palace reappeared
     where he was in town. ALADDIN is caught
    new bulb.)

JAFAR: (both under the lamp.) Take your tail off.
        Where are the timers?
IAGO: Oh, shut up, you idiot!
JAFAR: I'm not telling you to shut up!
GENIE: I'm sorry. (He takes the lamp and walks over
        on the balcony. He's now wearing a baseball cap. The
        he makes it as if he were throwing a lamp, but he opens it
        cut off the palm branches and throw them into the desert
        with his hand.) Ten thousand years in the cave
        may miracles rest him!

(JAFAR and IAGO continue arguing as they disappear. JASMINE walks away.
    to ALADDIN. They hold hands, but both look sad).

ALADDIN: Jasmine, I lied to you a
        Prince.
JASMINE: I know why.
ALADDIN: Well, I guess... this is... good? (GENIE said this
        his head in the corner surprises him with his condition
        is'aña.)
JASMINE: Oh this stupid slave. It’s not fair, I love you.
GENIE: (wipes a smile) Al, okay. You're a very strong man
        I have a wish. Just say the word and you are one
        the prince again.
ALADDIN: But Genie, what about your freedom?
GENIE: Hey, it's just a lifetime of slavery. is
        love. (She sits down next to him.) Al, you are
        I can’t find another girl like her in a million
        years. Believe me, I know. I'm looking at it.
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I love you, but I have to stop
        pretending to be something I don’t have.
JASMINE: I see.

(They make eye contact for the last time, and ALADDIN returns
    For engineering.)

ALADDIN: Genie, I want you to be free.
GENIUS: The true pedigree of the future prince. What do I have ?
ALADDIN: (He waves his lamp at the GENIUS.) Genius, you are
        knock it out!

(A transformation scene follows where the chains fall
    GENI's wrist and lamp fell uselessly to the ground.
     GENIE takes it and looks down.)

GENIE: (Disbelieving.) Hey, hey! I’m free to go. I am
        free. (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.) Quickly,
        hurry up, expect something out of the ordinary. “I’m going to ride
        Nile country. » I want Niili. Try it out!
ALADDIN: I'm waiting for the Nile.
GENIE: It’s not like that!! (Laughs hysterically. He rebounds
        like a pinball machine on the balcony.) Oh, Please
        OK! I am free! I was finally free! i'm stirred
        process. I want to explore the world! I--

(He picks up his suitcase, but looks down when he sees ALADDIN staring at him
    it’s a very sad thing.)

ALADDIN: Genie, I love you.
GENIE: I'm sorry, Al. No matter what anyone says, you do it
        be a prince to me.

(They kiss. The SULTAN steps forward.)

SULTAN: That is true. You have certainly proved your worth
        because it comes to me. This rule is what it is
        jan walt'a.
JASMINE: ¿Tata?
SULTAN: Well, am I the Sultan or am I the Sultan? From today onwards
        from now on the princess will marry whomever she judges
        what.
JASMINE: (With a big smile, she runs into ALADDIN's arms).
        Him! I choose... I choose you, Aladdin.
ALADDIN: Yeah, yeah. Please call me Al.

(They were about to kiss, when long green hands gather them all together.
    GENIE wears a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy shirt
     sombrero.)

GENIE: Oh, all of you. Come here. Great group hug!
        Do you mind if I kiss a monkey? (He kisses ABU.) Ooh, .
        it's heartbreaking! Well, you can't do any more damage here
        this ice cream show . I'm going to leave! Bye,
        you two crazy lovebirds. Hello, Rugman: ciao! I am
        history! No, I am a mythologist! No, I didn't do anything
        what am I, I am free!

(GENIUS flies into the black sky, leaving a rap of sparks
    in the background. They cut it (jumping makes it worse) .
     to the fireworks exploding in the nightscape. We're on our knees watching
     ALADDIN and JASMINE running on a RUG.)

ALADDIN: A New World
JASMINE: A new life
PANI: (off-camera chorus) For you and me!
MALE CHORUS: A new era!

(They run and disappear in the moonlight,
    the moon turns to show NERO's laughter. Suddenly
    film is caught "in the spotlight", GENIUS is picked up
     and looks at the audience.)

GENIUS: I made it look!

(Return movie to normal, moon back to normal. Black fading.
    End.)

Transcript is available in short order
[Fading into black. A Hip of crimson mist before a wall of red flame.
The fog is composed of gold letters: "Aladdin". The lyrics shimmer and fly.
In the desert, a petty merchant rides a camel and sings in the silent night as the opening credits roll.]

The seller is:

♪ Oh, I come from a land, far away ♪

♪ Where camels travel in caravan ♪

♪ Where they cut your ears if you don't want your face ♪ / ♪ Where it's hot and big and the heat is intense ♪

♪ It’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home! ♪

♪ When the wind comes from the east and the sun comes from the west and the sand glass area ♪

♪ Get off, stand up, jump on the carpet and fly into another Arabian night! ♪

[Above the dunes shows Agrabah. The castle really dominates the view, and the trader sings as he approaches the city border.]

The seller is:

♪ Arabian nights like Arabian days ♪

♪ Usually hotter, warmer ♪

♪ In many ways! ♪

[The camera pans to a city street where the fire eater is doing his thing. It spits fireworks, which brings us back to the merchant.]

♪ A thousand and one nights, under the Arabian moon ♪

♪ Confused, disorganized, can fall and hit hard ♪

♪ The dune ♪

[An exhausted camel falls off all fours, shivering in tears, and its driver jerks him violently behind him.
Shakes hands when speaking to the examiner(s)].

Peddler: Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. (greeting) Come closer.

[Camera zooms in and hits the customer's face].

Salesman: (awkwardly) Ugh... Too close. A little too close .

[Fortunately for all present, the camera is pulled back slightly].

Peddler: Ah, there it is. Welcome to Agrabah... (lights fire) City of Mysteries... (nods camel's head) Charming...

[He opens the bag on the camel's back, which suddenly becomes the fully decorated stall of a bazaar].

Peddler: And the best stuff this side of Jordan, on sale today. I'm going to disappear. Uh huh.

[She pulls a rather visible vase from the top of the stall.]

Peddler: Look. If. Hookah and coffee makers together . (dipping in the onion) Also make julienne potatoes. There is no condemnation.
(Plaps it on the table) It won't matter...

[Boo! The top comes off.]

Pedlar: (speechless) It was broken. (throws it aside) Oh! Let's take a look at it. (pulls out box) Never seen one intact.
This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware . Hear...

[He opens and blows a raspberry for effect].

Peddler: Ah, that's good.

[Now it’s obvious: not interested. The camera starts moving away from the merchant, who desperately tries to catch up with us.]

Salesman: (shrugs) Wait, don't leave! (smiles) I see I'm only interested in what's exceptionally rare.
I guess then you'd be well rewarded for thinking... this.

[The merchant takes the iconic magic lamp from his sleeve and holds it lovingly in his hands.]

Pedlar: Don't let its simple appearance fool you. Like so many other things, it's not what's on the outside that counts, it's what's on the inside.

[The camera pans again. But the seller does not give up and tries once again to stay in front of buyers].

Pedlar: (sadly) This is no ordinary lamp! It changed the young man's life.
The boy who loved the lamp was more than he was. (looks round, whispering) Diamond in the rough. (smiles) .
Maybe you want to hear a story?

[The merchant pours the shiny dust from the lamp onto his hands...].

Pedlar: The dark night begins…

[...and throws it into the sky, where it creates a starry night.]

Peddler (vo): Where the dark man waits... with a dark purpose...

(The camera pans to an open desert where Jafar is waiting on a hilltop on a horse's dirt floor.
His companion, the parrot Iago, is still perched on his shoulder, while a slightly tattered figure approaches them from the darkness.
Newcomer Gazeem dismounts and congratulates the pair.]

Jafar: You're late.

Gazeem: (kneeling) So sorry, oh patient.

Jafar: So you have it?

Gazeem: I had to cut some throats, but I did it.

[He pulls out a locket: half a gold nugget. Jafar reaches out to take it, but Gazeem takes it away].

Gazeem: That's a great example. (Holds out his free hand) Treasure.

[Iago shouts as he passes and grabs the locket].

Gazeem: Well done!

Jafar: Trust me, my friend. You find what comes to you.

Iago: What's wrong with you? So it’s a good idea!

(Jafar takes the other half of the locket. It interacts with them and forms a golden beetle. It lives and flies away).

Jafar: Hurry up! Follow the path!

(On horseback, the three of them chase the locket through the moonlit desert)

Jafar: Faster!

[The creature splits in half and they both lie in a sand dune. An impressive tiger head rises from the dune .
The chunky sections end up in her glowing eyes . Men's horses rear up on their hind legs and throw their horses.
Jafar smiles, the tiger's head opening its hollow mouth].

[horse screams].

[cold wail]

Jafar: Finally after all the years of searching... The Cave of Wonderland.

Iago: Awk. Hole of Wonders!

Gazeem: ( whispering) By Allah...

Jafar: Now you have to decide. Bring me the lamp! The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is... mine. [laugh]

(Gazeem begins to approach the lion's mouth, the entrance to the cave. He laughs as he walks away).

Iago: Oh lamp. Oh, the lamp. (Now it's just Iago and Jafar, Iago opens up in normal English.) Damn, where did you find that bozo?

(Jafar puts his hand over his mouth and silences him. Gazeem crawls towards the entrance to the mouth of the cave.
He's looking deep into her mouth as her lips turn into a staircase.
He stuck in one of the tiger's teeth, but was startled by the sound of voices in the cave).

Cave: [echo growling] Who disturbed my sleep?

Gazeem: [the thief snorts] I, Gazeem, humble thief.

Hole: You have to recognize that. Only one can come here. Whose value is far away. A diamond is rough.

(Gazeem turns to Jafar with a questioning look).

Jafar: What are you waiting for? Jack.

[animal's pride]

(Gazeem hesitates and steps into the cave with one foot. With great fear he drops his foot. Nothing happens.
He takes a deep breath and continues on. Then comes another scream. He turns around, but the lion's mouth closes and the dune returns to normal.
All that remains is Jafar, Iago and two separate half medallions.)

Jafar: NO NO!

Hole: Ask... a diamond that's rough...

Iago: [coughs] I can't believe it. I don’t believe it! We’ll never get our hands on that stupid lamp!
Forget about it! Let's take a look at it. Let's take a look at it. I was so tickled and wanted to piss. (He runs into Jafar's arms).

Jafar: Be patient, Iago. Patience. Gazeem was not good enough.

Iago: (very sarcastic) Oh, it's a big surprise. It’s unbelievable… I think I’m going to die of this weird heart attack.
What are we going to do? We have a big problem here, a big…

[Jafar rubs his tail].

Jafar: Yes. Only one can enter. I need to find this, this… diamond.

(Cut to the ceiling, where Aladdin runs up the hill with the bread. He nearly falls to the top).

Razoul: Don't give up! Thief! I'll take the trophy from you, street rat!

Aladdin: (Looks back, then down, then towards the bread.) All this for bread? Oooooh!

(He jumps and lands on two ropes that are tied between the buildings, and his clothes are dry.
She looks at them and picks up her own clothes as she walks away.
Eventually, he approaches the end of the rope near the window as he reaches over and closes the blinds.
Aladdin hits the blinds and falls into the street. Several awnings and a pile of clothes around him break his fall.
She takes off her first layer of clothes and is about to eat her bread when...)

Guard 1: There!

Guard 2: You won't get past this easily!

Aladdin: Did you think that was easy?

(He looks at the three women and mocks them).

Razoul: You two, this way, and you, follow me. We’ll find him.

(Aladdin puts on a sheet and covers himself to disguise himself. He rushes to the women).

Aladdin: Hello, ladies.

Woman 1: We've had a bit of trouble this morning, haven't we, Aladdin?

Aladdin: The problem? You are welcome. You only get into trouble if you get caught.

(A hand grabs Aladdin's arm and pulls him back. It's Razoul. Aladdin's mask falls).

Razoul: I got you!

Aladdin: I'm in trouble.

Razoul: And this time... (Abu shouts, and the guard's turban is pulled over his eyes. Abu points to the guard's head, laughing).

Aladdin: Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

Ash: Hey.

Aladdin: Come on. Let’s get out of here. i'm.

(The guard tosses Aladdin, but destroys the fish barrel. Abu waddles the guard, then dodges the attack. Aladdin then drops the guard's pants)

♪ A jump before the end ♪

♪ Slightly forward ♪

♪ I only steal what I can't sell ♪ That's all.

(Aladdin runs away, the guard gives him the fish like pants from his lower body).

♪ One step ahead of the rule ♪

♪ That's it, and it's not a joke ♪

♪ These guys don't like me being broke! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu run into a pile of barrels and hit the guards).

Guardia: (but mayni) ♪ Riffraff! ♪

♪ ¡Calle instalment! ♪

♪ Deceiver! ♪

(throws fruit at Aladdin) ♪ Take it! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Just a little snack, guys. ♪

Guard: ♪ Tear it up, take it back, guys! ♪

(Aladdin runs upstage. The guards rock the stage back and forth to try and pull him down).

Aladdin: ♪ I see ♪

♪ I have to face facts ♪

(Aladdin leaps from the stage to his literal death to grab Abu’s arms like an acrobat. The two of them hover in the harem).

♪ ¡Juma sapakïtawa, Abu! ♪

Harem Girls: Who?

♪ Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom ♪

(Abou finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs it into his mouth like a chipmunk).

♪ He became single to increase crime ♪

Woman 2: ♪ I want to blame the parents, but he doesn’t have them. ♪

Aladdin: ♪ I have to eat to live, ♪

♪ I can steal food ♪

♪ Will tell you all about it when I have time! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu get out and run over the awning. They cut a muscular man pushing through the crowd. The guards rush in."
Cut to Aladin and Abu following the muscular man as he walks to make mistakes and be seen. )

♪ Jump forward slowly. ♪

♪ One step before I lost. ♪

♪ Next time I'll name a pen. ♪

Razoul: There he is!

(A sequence where Aladdin and Abu run through a flock of sheep pursued by guards and crash into an artist lying on a bed of nails.
[of course a very large guard descends on him])

Aladdin: ♪ Jump in front of the assassins ♪

♪ One step ahead of the pack ♪

♪ I think I'm going to go for a walk in the neighborhood ♪

(Abou disguises herself with jewelry until the merchant finds her).

Man 1: ♪ Don't stop, thief! ♪

Aljiri 1: 🔥 ¡Vandal! 

Aladdin: ♪ ¡Abu! ♪

Woman 3: ♪ Scandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Don't move too fast ♪

(Aladdin is surrounded by GUARDS in front of the door. The door opens and a tall, ugly woman enters)

Woman: ♪ I think that’s cool though! ♪

(Aladdin kneels down and shakes hands with the guard, acting like everyone is a friend).

Aladdin: ♪ I have to eat to live, ♪

♪ I can steal food ♪

♪ Otherwise, good luck! ♪

Guard: DON'T FAST!

(The guards jump on Aladdin, but are shot. His paint rolls onto the pots)

Leader: Get him!

(Aladdin jumps at the artist, who is walking harmlessly through the hot ashes. The guards run through the ashes, burning their feet and jumping in agony.
Aladdin and Abu encounter a sword eater, and Abu turns around to remove the sword from the eater's mouth. (Abu goes to the guards, who stand in fear).

Guard: He has a sword!

Razoul: You idiots. We all have swords!

(The guards draw their swords. Abu lowers his sword and runs away. Aladdin and Abu are surrounded again, guards coming from left and right.
(He jumps up and climbs onto a stunt suit that goes down the street as all the guards shoot each other).

Aladdin: ♪ A leap before my feet ♪

Guardianaka: ¡Vandal!

Aladdin: ♪ A leap before the hump ♪

Guardianaka: Rat Street!

Aladdin: ♪ One turn before disaster strikes ♪

Guardianaka: ¡Trickster!

Aladdin: ♪ They move fast, but I'm faster ♪

(The guards chase Aladdin up the stairs into the room. He grabs the rug...)

Aladdin: ♪ Well, ♪

♪ You better have your hands on ♪

♪ I wish you a better world, ♪

♪ All you have to do is jump! ♪

(..and jumps out the window like the carpet is magic.
The guards chased him through the window, but fell straight into the street,
the soil labeled "Mad Hakim's Discount Fertilizer" on the fertilizer cart. )

Guards: Happy! Hey!

(Aladdin uses the carpet as a parachute to land safely. Aladdin and Abu greet each other)

Aladdin: And now, honored effendi, we feast. Light.

(Aladdin divided the bread in half and gave half to Abu, who began to eat.
But Aladdin looks up and sees two little kids looking for food in the garbage can.
The girl sees it, then throws away what she's found and tries to hide. Aladdin looks down at them, then at the bread, then at Abouta.)

Abu: Nam, nam! Voi ei.

(Abou takes a big bite of his food, but Aladdin gets up and approaches the children. The girl pushes her brother back).

Aladdin: [sighs] This is great. Jack. You have to take it.

(The children laugh happily. Abu tries to swallow his mouth, then looks guilty. He walks over to the children and offers them his bread.
They patted him on the head with joy).

Abu: Ah, don't do that. Or is it a ?

(ABU sees ALADDIN coming into the daylight where the parade is taking place. ALADDIN looks over the shoulders of the crowd.
He sees PRINCE ACHMED on a horse.)

PASSENGER 1: On the way to the palace, I think.

BYSTANDER 2: Another suitor for the princess.

(ALADDIN is startled when two children run across the alley. TRUTH surprises him by running in front of ACHMED's horse).

ACHMED: ¡Nayan thakijat mistu, brat!

(ACHMED raises his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN jumps in front of them and grabs the whip).

ALADDIN: Hey, if I were as rich as you, I'd trade virtue!

ACHMED: Oh, I'll teach you to walk!

(ACHMED throws ALADDIN into a ditch. The audience laughs at him).

ALADDIN: Look, Abu. It’s not every day you see a horse behind two!

(ACHMED stands up and turns back to ALADDIN.)

AHMED: Oh my gosh! You are a worthless street rat! You are born a street rat, you die a street rat and only fleas cry for you.

(ALADDIN rushes to ACHMED, but the castle gates close in his face).

ALADDIN: I am not vain. And I don’t have fleas. Come on, Abu. Let’s go home.

(ALADDIN drives home with a view, then returns to ABU for the night).

ALADDIN: Riffraff, street rats. I didn't buy it. If they had looked closer, would they have seen the poor guy? Not the father. They'd know there was more to me.

(He pulls back a curtain to reveal a grand palace.) One day, Abu, things will change.
We are rich, we live in a palace, and we never have problems.

(Blurring the same shot to day time. Cut to the interior of the SULTAN's bedroom. The door opens and PRINCE ACHMED rushes in, missing the back of his trousers.)

ACHMED: I've never been so humiliated.

SULTAN: Oh Prince Ahmed. You wouldn’t leave that early, would you?

ACHMED: Good luck marrying her.

SULTAN: Oh Jasmine. Jasmine is alright! Jasmine is alright! (The SULTAN goes to the garden in search of his daughter.
He finds it but is stopped by RAJAH, JASMINE's pet tiger. RAJAH has an underwear of PRINCE ACHMED in his mouth.
The SULTAN seized the cloth and pulled it out of the RAJAH's mouth.) Unconscious Rajah! That's why Prince Ahmed is so strong!

JASMINE: Oh, Dad. Rajah was playing with him, wasn't he. (The RAJAH comes over and puts his arm around JASMINE and lets him kiss her).
You're playing the overdressed, self-promoting Prince Ahmed, aren't you?
(He leans into the RAJAH, happy from the moment, looking angrily at his father.) Ahem.

SULTAN: My dear brother, you must not ignore all the suitors who invite you. The law states that.

BOTH: ...be married to a prince.

(Head towards the pigeon cage).

SULTAN: Until the next birthday.

JASMINE: The law is wrong.

SULTAN: Only three days!

JASMINE: Dad, I hate this. (Takes the dove out of the cage and strokes it.) If you marry, I want it to be love.

SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not just this rule. (Hands over the pigeon and he puts it back in the cage).
I won’t be here forever and I want you to be seen and cared for.

JASMINE: Try to understand. I never did anything on my own. (He waves his hand in the pond water, caressing the fish).
I never had any real friends. (RAJH growls at him.) Except you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he went back to bed).
I never left the palace walls.

SULTAN: But Jasmine, you are a princess.

JASMINE: So maybe she doesn't want to be a princess anymore. (He splashes water).

SULTAN: Oooohhh! God forbid you have daughters!

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a moment. JASMINE goes to the pigeon cage and opens the door. The giants fly for freedom. He watches her leave.
The value of the int. from the apartments of the SULTAN.)

SULTAN: I don't know where he got it. His mother was not such a choice. (A shadow falls on him. He looks up in surprise and sees JAFAR).
Oh no, I don't. Ah, Jafar, my most trusted advisor. I want your knowledge.

JAFAR: My life is all about serving you, sir. (He kneels down).

SULTAN: It’s like this pretender. Jasmine does not want to choose a man. I am at the end of the thread.

IAGO: (in parrot voice) Aww! Head roll .

SULTAN: Ah, yes, yes. Enjoy, beautiful Polly! (He pulls a cookie out of his pocket. IAGO looks shocked. Then the SULTAN puts it in Iago's mouth.
IAGO winces as he tries to eat. JAFAR and SULTANI both laugh.)

JAFAR: His Majesty must have a problem with gentle animals. (IAGO looks at him.) Now you may be able to figure out the solution to this difficult problem.

SULTAN: Who can help, that's you.

JAFAR: Ah, but you'd have to use the Mystic Blue Diamond for that.

SULTAN: Oh, my ring? But it has been in the family for many years.

JAFAR: We have to find a suitor for the princess. (JAFAR pronounces the word "princess" with an emphasis on the second syllable "cess".
He swings the cobra head stick towards the SULTAN. The eyes of the workers began to light up. The room goes dark, JAFAR's voice slowly deepens.
THE SULTAN'S eyes are mesmerizing.) Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

SULTAN: Everything...will subside...well.

JAFAR: But diamonds.

SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Everything you need is well equipped.

(The SULTAN removes the ring and gives it to JAFAR. JAFAR removes the wand and the room returns to normal).

JAFAR: You're so kind, Liege. Now run and play with your little toys.

SULTAN: (Still mesmerized) Yeah... that's... very nice.

(JAFAR and IAGO walk out. We follow them. As we leave the room, the parrot smells cookies).

IAGO: I can't take it anymore! If I end up choking on another one of those disgusting cookie molds... bam! Hit!

(JAFAR pulls out a rope, indicating a hidden entrance to their rooms).

JAFAR: Calm down, Iago.

IAGO: Then I grabbed his head. Hit! Hit!

JAFAR: (Speaking of IAGO.) Soon, I'll be the Sultan, not this confused idiot.

IAGO: And then I threw cookies down his throat! Haha!

(The couple enter the door and splash. Diss. goes out into the garden at night. A dark man comes in. We see JASMINE in disguise.
He reaches the palace wall and begins to climb it. RAJAH threw him behind him.)

JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here, I can live my life for me too. I will miss you.
(He resumes his climb and is helped by RAJAH, who begins to cough and complain.) Goodbye!

(It disappears over the wall. Daylight cuts into the street. ALADDIN and ABU are resuming their sleight of hand. They are under the awning of the fruit stand).

ALADDIN: Well, Abu. Go!

(ABU dives into the sea and looks at the OWNER.)

OWNER: (To owners) Try that, your taste buds will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and holds it, distracts).
Hey, take your legs off.

ABU: ¡Blah blah!

OWNER: Well you. Get out of here you filthy monkey.

(He grabs the melon from ABU's hand. But in the foreground, ALADDIN bends down and picks another melon off the shelf.)

ABU: Good morning.

(Now he gets up. The OWNER brings the melon in front of him, where he places it on the pile. He looks confused, as if he had just done so).

ALADDIN: Very well, Abu. Breakfast will be served.

(ALADDIN and ABU open a melon on the roof and eat it. We see JASMINE walking down the street).

SHOP 1: Good woman, buy a bowl. There could be no finer dish made of brass or silver.

SELLER 2: Sweet dates, sweet dates and figs! Sweet dates and pistachios!

SHOP 3: Should a woman wear a necklace? A beautiful necklace for a beautiful woman.

(He’s in love with the process, but is shocked when a fish falls in his face).

4 SHOP: Fresh fish! We caught them, you bought them!

JASMINE: I don't think so. (She turns back, but runs into the fire eater, who is stunned by the fire.) Sorry.
(She eats, then spits fire out of her mouth. JASMINE hates it. She is happy and rubs her stomach. ALADDIN notices her, and a strange look comes over her face.) I'm really, really sorry.

ALADDIN: (He obviously loves her.) Wow.

(He throws his cloak over Hood's head. ABU sees this and jumps into his arms, waving his hand over ALADDIN'S face.)

ABU: That's a great example. Good morning? Good morning?

(JASMINE stops at a fruit stand and sees a homeless child looking for fruit. She picks one and gives it to him).

JASMINE: Oh, you must be hungry. Here’s the existing one. (The boy runs away).

OWNER: You better be able to pay.

JASMINE: (Mystified) Jig?

OWNER: Nobody stole my cart.

JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I don't have the money.

OWNER: Thief.

JASMINE: Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can take you from the Sultana.

OWNER: Do you know the punishment for stealing?

(He takes her hand and ties it to the table, intending to cut her off).

JASMINE: No, no, thank you.

(The sword is thrown, but is stopped by ALADDIN's hand).

ALADDIN: Thank you, good sir. I am so glad you found it. I'm looking for you everywhere.

JASMINE: ( whispering) What are you doing?

ALADDIN: (whispers backwards) Play.

OWNER: Do you know this girl?

ALADDIN: Unfortunately, yes. She’s my sister. He's a little crazy. (He puts his arm around his ear. He startles him. THE OWNER grabs him by his jacket).

OWNER: He said he knew the Sultan.

ALADDIN: He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

(ABU packs his pockets. He hears this, then gets up. JASMINE, playfully bows to ABU.)

JASMINE: Oh wise Sultan. How can I serve you?

ABU: No, blah blah blah.

ALADDIN: Sad, isn't it? (She leans forward and grabs another apple from the carrot with her foot).
But there is no problem. (He walks towards Jasmine.) Come on, sister. It’s time to go to the doctor.

JASMINE: (to a camel standing nearby) Hi Doctor. How is this going to happen?

ALADDIN: No, no, no. Don’t be afraid. (To ABU, whose pockets are expanding.) Come on, Sultan.

(ABU bows to the crowd and drops everything he stole from the cart).

OWNER: Great? What is this? (ABU grabs what he's taken and the three of them run off.) Get back here, little thieves!

(Cut inside the JAFAR lab. IAGO spins a gear in a strange contraption. A storm rages over the machine.)

[explosion] .

IAGO: (blushing and puffing) With all due respect, Rot, can't we just wait for a real storm?

JAFAR: Hold your breath, Iago. More immediately. (He machined the SULTAN's tire).

IAGO: Yes, mighty Evil. [flushes] .

(IAGO runs faster. Flame passes through the ring to the hourglass below. Sand begins to swirl.)

JAFAR: Nothing, the sands of time. Tell me who's in the cave.
(Head of sand creates Wonder Cave.
It falls into a storm, but ALADDIN is climbing a ladder, and JASMINE is veiled.)
Yes Yes! Here’s the existing one. My diamond is hard.

IAGO: Is he right? Is this the payoff you've been waiting for? (IAGO loses his footing and gets absorbed into the gears).

JAFAR: Let's give the guards an invitation to the palace, okay?

(IAGO walks past and headbutts the wall).

IAGO: They were. [cough]

(JAFAR laughs menacingly, and the camera zooms into the dust storm with ALADDIN.
Finally, we are joined by the real ALADDIN, which climbs to the top of the stairs, followed by JASMINE.)

[sad laughter]

ALADDIN: I'm already there.

(JASMINE climbs up next to it, but it trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms. He gets up).

JASMINE: I want to thank you for arresting this man.

ALADDIN: Forget it. (He holds the bar.) So, this is your first time in the market, right?

(ALADD pole-jumps to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE: So obvious?

ALADDIN: Well, you're welcome. (She looks at him, looking at him longingly. She returns his gaze.
But he realizes he did and he's back to normal.) I mean, you don't know how bad Agrabah can be.
(House sets up a board so he can walk on it, but when he bends over, it jumps over his head. He turns away in surprise.
He threw a stick at her. ALADDIN and ABU's eyes widen.)

JASMINE: I'm a fast learner.

ALADDIN: That's true. Come here. (They go to the roof of the house, avoiding the boards and beams as they walk.) Huh. Keep your head in there . Be careful.

JASMINE: Do you live here?

ALADDIN: Yes. I'm with Abumpiki. Come, go as you please.

JASMINE: Very nice.

ALADDIN: Well, not much (he pulls back the curtain to reveal the palace), but it's a great view. The palace looks really nice, doesn’t it?

JASMINE: Oh, that’s lovely.

ALADDIN: I wonder what it would be like to live there, with servants and slaves...

JASMINE: That's fine. People telling you where to go and how to dress.

ALADDIN: Much better than this place. You'll have to constantly scratch and dodge guards to find food.

JASMINE: You are not free to make up your own mind.

ALADDIN: Sometimes it's.

JASMINE: You just.

BOTH: (together) – caught.

(They get to know each other and realize their perfection. But then ALADDIN realizes where he is and breaks his gaze.
He takes the apple from ABU's hand and slides his hand into JASMINE's.)

ALADDIN: Well, where are you from?

JASMINE: What does it matter? I ran away and didn't come back.

ALADDIN: Really? How can it be so? (He bites the apple in his hand, then hands it to ABU, who looks annoyed).

ABU: Why are you...!

(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE).

JASMINE: My father is forcing me to marry him.

ALADDIN: It's... terrible. (ABU appears behind the princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!

(ABU runs to a higher level, talking and cursing as he goes).

JASMINE: What about you?

ALADDIN: Abu says... uh... that's not fair.

ABU: What is it?

JASMINE: Oh, huh?

ALADDIN: Yes, of course.

JASMINE: And does Abu have anything else to say?

ALADDIN: Well, he hopes he can do something to help her.

ABU: ¡Ay wayna!

JASMINE: Hmm... tell him it's so... so nice.

(ALADDIN and JASMINE get even closer until ALADDIN leans down to kiss her. He is stopped by the discovering guards).

ANSWER: You’re there!

ALADDIN and JASMINE: They're after me! (to each other) Do yours follow?

JASMINE: My father must have sent them…

ALADDIN: Can you trust me?

JASMINE: What about you?

ALADDIN: Can you trust me? (He raises his hand)

JASMINE: Yeah. (He takes it).

ALADDIN: Then jump!

(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt. They try to escape, but the GUARD prevents them from leaving).

GUARD: We're going to keep shooting at each other, aren't we, street rat?

(ABU shoots the guard's turban again, but other guards are there and block the exit.
The first RUSH rips off ABU's head and throws him into a vase. Three guards catch ALADDIN.)
- .
ANSWER: This is a prison for you, kid.

ALADDIN: Hey, I gotta leave!

JASMINE: He has to go.

ACTION: (didn't realize she was a princess) Look what you got here, guys: a street mouse. (He falls to the ground).

JASMINE: (sayt’asisaw abrigopan capuchap apsu) ¡Princesan kamachiparjam sarañapawa!

(GUARDIANAKAX mä akatjamat sayt’asisin qunqurt’asipxäna, ukat ALADDIN-arux qunqurt’asiñapatakiw wayt’äna).

JANK’AKÄWI: Princesa Jasmine.

ALADDIN: ¿Mä princesa?

ABU: (jarro uñkatasi) Princesa?

RULER: ¿Kuns palacio anqan luraskta? Ukat aka calle ratampixa?

JASMINE: Janiw jumanakan jan waltʼäwimäkiti. Kunjamtï sisktxa ukham lurapxam. ¡Juparux qhispiyapxam!

JASMINE: (wali qarjataw uñnaqani) Iyawsapxita, nayax lurarakïwa.

(Palacio manqhan uñakipt’apxam, JAFAR jupax jamasat apartamentonakapat mistu.
He carefully closes the door, but the princess rushes in before he can finish. He closes it and stays in the door frame of IAGO.)

JASMINE: Jafar?

JAFAR: Oh, princess.

IAGO: Oh! Jafar, I'm stuck!

JAFAR: How can I help you? (She rubs her clothes and hides the door).

JASMINE: The guards would take the boy to the market at your request.

JAFAR: Your father told me to make peace in Agrabah. The boy was a bad guy.

JASMINE: What was the case?

IAGO: I can't breathe, Jafar.

JAFAR: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.

IAGO: You just... (JAFAR pushes back inside the door and it closes) - wow, that's annoying!

JASMINE: He didn't kidnap me! I was running away!

JAFAR: (walking away in shock) Oh my God! Oh, how wonderful. I'd be a scientist.

JASMINE: What do you mean?

JAFAR: Unfortunately, the guy's sentence has already been served.

JASMINE: Kuna phrasesa?

JAFAR: (sinful voice) Death. (JASMINE smiles.) Hit her jaw.

JASMINE: No! (He falls to the ground).

JAFAR: I'm so sorry, princess.

JASMINE: How do you do it? (She screams and runs from the room).

(IAGO finally manages to get through the door. He trips and lands in JAFAR's arms, coughing).

IAGO: How did it go?

JAFAR: I think he carried... it's great. (They both have dark smiles on their faces).

(Speak to JASMINE at night, crying by the well. RAJAH comes to comfort her. He hugs her).

JASMINE: It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn’t even know his name.

(Cut to the inside of the diner. Rats fly and we descend to see ALADDIN chained to the wall).

ALADDIN: (to himself) She's a princess. I don't believe it. It must have looked silly to him!

ABU: (jaya) Oh-ho! Is it Aladdin? Good morning!

(The ABU is in the window above the dungeon).

ALADDIN: Abu! Here! Hey, please help me with this.

(ABU stands up, then starts talking wildly, falling to the ground. He wraps the cloth around his head and makes big eyes for the princess to learn).

ALADDIN: Hey, he was in trouble. Ah, he’s good enough.

(ABU jumps into ALADDIN's arms and takes a small set of tools from his pocket, then releases ALADDIN.)

ABU: Jïsa, jïsa, jïsa.

ALADDIN: Hello huoli, Abou. En näe häntä enää koskaan . Olen caturotta, muista, and seal and distribute. Hänen täytyy men naimisiin prinssin kanssa and more. Hän ansaitsee .

(ABU vapauttaa lopulta ALADDINin kädet.)

ABU: ¡Ta-da!

ALADDIN: (hieroi ranteitaan) Olen.

OLD MAN: You are ina ch'usat qillqt'ata if you give up, son.

(We see an old man sitting in the corner whom ALADDIN and ABU have not seen before) ukax mä jach'a uñacht'äwiwa.

ALADDIN: Who are you?

OLD: A humble prisoner like you. But together we can be more ukax mä juk'a pachanakanwa.

ALADDIN: I'm listening to the sat jila.

OLD MAN: There ukax cave, my son... a cave of wonders, full of treasures beyond your wildest dreams. Ukhamaraki, ukaxa mä juk'a pachanakwa lurasirakispa.

(Listeners will note that CHIQA JAQIN pronounced the word "princess" as "princess" rather than "PRIN-cess".
The OLD MAN turns his back on him and IAGO pokes his head out of JAFAR's "old man" mask.) Ukax mä jach'a uñacht'äwiwa.

IAGO: Jafar, ¿janiw kunas utjkiti? I'm dying for this. [screaming].

ALADDIN: But the law says, ukat inamaya prince can...

OLD MAN: ¿You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you? Who owns the gold makes the rules ukax mä juk'a pachanakanwa. (He smiles and shows a terribly bad mouth.) [squealing laughter ukax mä jach'a uñacht'äwiwa.

ALADDIN: ¿Why qunt'asis would you share all this wonderful treasure with me?

OLD MAN: I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to chase him ukax mä jach'a uñacht'äwiwa.

ALADDIN: Ongelma. Se and siellä. Olemme täällä .

(VANHA MAN would be the one who used the pilot.) It's a big show.

OLD: Mm-mm-mm ukat juk'ampinaka. Things are not always what they seem ukat juk'ampinaka. So... do we have a deal ukat juk'ampinaka?

(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs ukat juk'ampinaka.)

ABU: Oh, you don't know.

(Cut to a desert. We see ALADDIN leading a horse, accompanied by the BIG MEN and ABU. Diss., in the Wonder Mountains.)

[snowflakes]

HEART: Who disturbs my sleep?

ALADDIN: I'm sorry, Aladdin.

HEART: Let’s move on. Do not touch anything other than the lamp.

(The pit opens with a bang and stairs appear in front of ALADDIN).

LITTLE: Remember, son, bring me a lamp first, and you'll have your reward.

ALADDIN: Come on, Abu. (hiding ABU under the sleeve of his coat).

[screaming]

(ALADDIN starts down the stairs. Once inside, he enters a golden room full of treasure).

ALADDIN: Would you like to see it?

ABU: [complains] Ohh.

ALADDIN: A few of those things could make you richer than the Sultan.

(ABU watches, sees treasure, then runs to it).

ALADDIN: Abu and so on.

[white]

(ABU stops midway, slumps on the carpet on the floor).

ALADDIN: Don't touch anything. We need to find the lamp.

(They start walking across the room when MATTO gets up off the floor and starts following them. ABU presumably follows them).

ABU: Now?

(He turns around and MATTO is lying on the ground. He continues and MATTO starts following him again.
The ABU spun again, but the ALFORMA slipped and hit the treasure pile. (ABU runs towards ALADDIN and pulls his pant leg).

ABU: Aladdin, Aladdin.

ALADDIN: Abu, can you stop him?

(Again MAT follows, but this time ABU turns around and jumps to the other side of the mat.
He comes down with the pompom and throws the tail of the ABU. When ABU jumps, CARPET jumps again to the other side.
This time ABU landed in karate. MATO kneels down and grabs ABU's hat, then puts it on himself.
ABU thought for a moment until MATO pointed an acorn at his face. ABU and CARPET both jump in fear and run.
ABU grabs ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the ALFORMA.)

[yell]

ALADDIN: Abu, what are you crazy about?

(Behind the treasure pile is a carpet).

ALADDIN: The Magic Carpet. Come on. Get out of here. I will not hurt you.

(CARP comes out slowly, creepily, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts it off. He runs towards ALADDIN and hands the hat to the ABU next to him.
(ABU screams and jumps into ALADDIN's arms).

[yell]

ALADDIN: Hey, don't worry too much, Abu. He doesn't want to bite. THANK YOU.

(CARPET picks up ABU's hat again and gives it to him. ABU shrugs and screams. CARPET starts to walk away, "sorry.")

[screaming]

ALADDIN: Hello. Wait a minute. Don't go to the gym. Maybe you can help. (ALFORMA looks back in excitement. Then runs around the couple).
Hey, huh. Look, we're trying to find this lamp. (ALFORMA motions for them to follow him.) I think he knows where he is.

ABU: [whispers happily] [echoes].

(They go through a long cave until they emerge into a large underground cave. In the middle of the room is a large pillar with stairs leading up to it.
It's surrounded by water and misplaced stones form a bridge. There is a light at the top of the pillar. ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)

ALADDIN: [ whispering] Wait here.

ABU: [complaining] Oh. Or is it a ? I see!

(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey. There is a large ruby ​​on the stretched legs. ABU falls hypnotically. ALADDIN quickly runs up the stairs.
CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail, trying in vain to stop him. ALADDIN finally gets the TAG LAMP.)

ALADDIN: Is that right? That's why we came here... (He looks down and sees ABU running off the MAT to the jewelry.)
Abu! NOW!

(ABU grabs the jewelry. A thud is heard and the room begins to shake).

HEARTBREAK: Infidels!

ABU: That's a great example.

PUICHAWIN'S WORD: You have touched the unstoppable treasure! (ABU put the gem back on top, but the gem and shrine turned to lava).
From now on, you will never see the light again!

ALADDIN: ¡Waw!

(ALADDIN runs down the stairs, but the stairs hit a ramp, sending him flying down into the air. The water turns to lava.
He falls towards her when suddenly GURSU appears and grabs him. The ABU is standing on a rock on the bridge .
He looks left and right and sees rocks turning to lava . Then CARPET rushes in and catches ALADDIN just as the last boulder explodes.)

ABU: Help, help, help!

ALADDIN: I got you! Wow Matto we’re leaving!

(Together they run through the cave, dodging walls and falling debris. ABU holds ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes).

ALADDIN: Abu! Abu, now is not the time to panic! (He takes ABU off his head and sees him flying to the wall.) Start sailing!

[Abu pant] [thunder thunder] [thunder].

(ALFORMA dives and passes through another hole. Finally, they emerge through the bottom door. Outside, the hole begins to creak and close.
MATO and company are almost on top when a rock falls on the mat and a THX Optimizer clip sends them to the floor.
ALADDIN hangs onto the stone wall. He sees the NOW, which is close.)

ALADDIN: Help!

NOW: Throw me a lamp!

ALADDIN: I can't stand it. Give me your hand!

NOW: Give me the lamp first!

(ALADDIN reaches out and takes the EARTH LAMP. He takes it and raises the HAIR MAN above his head).

JUST: [laughs] Yeah! finally! [lights the lamp].

[Aladdin is struggling].

(ALADDIN gets out with ABU's help. But THE MAN IN QUESTION pushes ABU and grabs ALADDIN's wrist).

ALADDIN: What are you doing?

RIGHT: I will give you your reward! (JAFAR continues in his normal voice.) Eternal reward. [yell]

(He picks up the twisted dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN when ABU bites his wrist. He screams but releases ALADDIN, who falls into the cave.
LITTLE Man throws ABU into the hole. The clip ends with the THX Optimizer. ALFORNA sees him but is stuck under a rock.
He tries to escape, and he escapes. He quickly grabs ALADDIN, but he hits the wall several times and is knocked unconscious.
At the top, the cave roars for the last time before sinking back into the dust. JAFAR removes his mask.) [screams].

[roar].

JAFAR: That’s mine! It’s all mine! I-- (He doesn't find it in his pocket) Where's it? No! No...!

(The kiss breaks to JASMINE's room. She sits on the bed next to a sad-looking RAJAH. The SULTAN enters).

SULTAN: Jasmina? Oh dear brother. What’s the wrong thing?

JASMINE: Jafar... did... something... terrible. (He appears to be crying).

SULTAN: There, there, there my son, we'll settle things. Now tell me everything.

(Cut to the bottom of the cave. ALADDIN is lying unconscious on top of GUSUN. ABU tries to wake him up.)

ABU: Oh, oh. Is it Aladdin? Develop. Aladdin is a brother.

(TAPIT gets up and picks up ALADDIN. He gets up slowly).

ALADDIN: Oh my head. (He peeks through the sealed entrance.) We're stuck. (Angry, sticking his finger in the entrance) That two-faced jackal boy!
(Reassuring) Who's he gone with that lamp for a long time.

ABU: Jesus!

(ABU takes the MAGIC LAMP)

ALADDIN: Good morning! Well, you little furry thief! It looks like ugly, useless scrap metal.
Hi, I think it's written here, but it's hard to understand.

(He flicks the LAMP. Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN clings to the lamp, and our dear,
GENIUS came out.)

GENIE: Aaaaahhhhh! Oh! Ten thousand years is such a pain in your neck! (He impales ALADDIN on a nearby rock.
She whirls around screaming, shaking her head. MATTO drops ALADDIN.)
Wow! Is it OK to be outside! (GENIE uses the end of his lamp as a microphone).
It's a pleasure to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hi, where are you from? (He puts the microphone in ALADDIN's face.) What's your name?

ALADDIN: Uh, al--uh--Aladdin.

GENIE: (says his name even as he finds something important) Aladdin! (The neon sign with the name ALADDIN is illuminated by chasing lights around it.
Character changes to show GENIUS next line.) Hello, Aladdin. It's great to have you on the show. Can we call you “Ali”? » Or maybe "Din?" »
Or how about "Laddi?" » (GENIE disappears, and a dog covered in a blanket comes in.) They would say, “Here, boy! Come on, Laddi!

ALADDIN: (shaking his head) I hit my head harder than I thought.

GENIE: (Still doggy) Do you smoke? Would you mind if I did? (The dog barks in the smoke, then turns back to GENIUS. ABU growls loudly).
Oh, sorry Cheetah, I hope I didn't burn my fur! Hi Rugman! I haven’t seen you in a few thousand years! Give me that pompom!
Hey! If! (AN ALFORMA runs up and greets NERO. NERO looks at ALADDIN.) Say, you are inferior to my last master.
(He holds up his beer belly.) Either that or I'm fatter. Sideways look: Do I look different to you?

ALADDIN: Wait a minute! I'm... your master?

GENIE: (places diploma in ALADDIN's hand and grenade in head.) That's right! We can teach him!!
What do you want from me, (like Arnold Schwarzenegger) always amazing, (in a bucket) long content, (with a ventriloquist doll)
learned many times, (pulls dummy aside) but never duplicated -- (He grows many GENEs around.) DUP.

GENIUS: Duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate.

GENIUS: (He speaks like a ring announcer at a boxing match.) Lamp genius! (Enter Ed Sullivan) Here, directly under the lamp,
here to have fun and fulfill your needs. THANK YOU!

ALADDIN: Wow! Do you want to be fulfilled?

GENIUS: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-no more to wish. (The slot machine turns into a slot machine, the hand goes down and the three Genies appear in the windows).
That’s it: three. (Three GENIE knights leave the area.) One, two, three. (Exchanges ab/w Groucho Marx.) No exchanges, exchanges or refunds.
(Duck translates the secret word "Reimbursements".

ALADDIN: (to ABU) Now I know I dreamed.

Genie: Master, I don't think you really understand what we have here! So why not just meditate, if you are enlightening your possibilities.
[Nero] .
Well, Ali Baba had forty thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand stories
But use your luck, because you have your work cut out for you
You have a magic that never ends!
(GENIE forms 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords. GENIUS appears in a jacket, reaches out and subdues the thieves).

[Nero] .
Now you have power in your corner
Some great ammo in your camp
You punch, spice, yahoo and whatever
See, all you have to do is dip this lamp
And I said, 'I'm sorry
(A boxing ring appears, in ALADD's corner, GENIUS hits it. Then GENIUS turns into a firecracker and explodes, shooting one of our heroes.
Then the GENIUS appeared under the lamp and took hold of ALADDIN's hand and shook the lamp.)

[Nero] .
Nanny Aladdin, nanny
What is your happiness?
I'd like to take your order, please write
You never had a friend like me
No, no, no, no!
(GENIE arranges the table and chairs, then jots things down in a notebook, like a waiter).

[Nero] .
Life is your restaurant and I am your master!
Come, ask what you want
You never had a friend like me.
(GENIE appears as a chicken dish, then returns to normal, but raises his ears to hear ALADDIN. Eventually transforms into four twin geniuses).

[Nero] .
Yes sir we are proud of our service
You are the boss, the king, the shah!
Say what you want, it’s yours!
A real plate How about some Baklava?
(Gens give him a shave, haircut and manicure, and ALADDIN appears in a comfortable armchair (eh?), surrounded by treasure and adored by the women.
GENIUS appears and fills the screen with baklava.)

[Nero] .
Try a short column "A".
Test the entire column "B".
I want to help you man
You never had a friend like me
(ALADDIN climbs the food column with a big A at the top, then jumps to another column with a B at the top.
He falls and gets caught in the pillow GENIE is holding. He opens his mouth and his mouth becomes a staircase.
A little NERO appears dressed as a magician. Mini GENIE makes a little dance with both thumbs.
Eventually they surround the minigen and destroy him.)

[Nero] .
Can your friends do it?
Do your friends do that?
Will your friends pull this out of a little hat?
Your friends can go crazy!
Well, look at this
Can your friends go to Abracadabra, let them rip
And then lose this bastard?
(NERO nods, copies, then juggles.
They cast ALADDIN, who is juggling with one arm, twirling one end in his hand like a basketball.
He drops his head to NERO, who's trying to get up from his base hat.
He spins around in a circle until he becomes a white rabbit. Rabbit turns into a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment at EPCOT Center).
The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS who dance around ALADDIN. Once you start having fun with them, they disappear).

[Nero] .
So don't just sit there, limp, empty
I am here to answer all midday prayers
You kindly got it, proof
Are you a genius in charge? business!
I would love to help you
So I really want to know what you want
You undoubtedly have a wish three miles away
So just rub it in, and oh!
(GENIE looks like something he calls ALADDIN, and turns it into a certificate that wraps around and around ALADDIN.
NERO takes a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, with which he sneezes dry after a shower.)

[Nero] .
Mr. Aladdin, sir, I want two or three
I'm at work, big mogul
You never have a friend, you never have a friend
You never have a friend, you never have a friend
Never… had a friend… like me!
You never had a friend like me!
(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in for a kiss. He turns into NERO, who brings four dancing elephants.
On the other side he blows on four dancing camels, followed by a great background dance number, and our heroes dance.
ABU grabs as much gold as he can, but GENIE wraps it all in a cyclone and wipes it all back in the cave.
GENIE has a neon "APLAUSE" sign on her back. ABU returns his hat and sees that it is empty.)

GENIE: What will happen, Master?

ALADDIN: Will you grant me three wishes?

GENIE: (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost. A few reservations, a few thoughts

ALADDIN: How is it?

GENIE: Ah, the first rule: You can't kill anyone. (He shaves his head with his hand.) Well, don't ask.
Rule number two: You can’t make someone love someone else. (The head becomes a giant pair of mouths kissing ALADDIN.)
Small penalty area. (Sleeps naked, then wakes up and becomes a zombie.) Rule Three: I can't raise people from the dead.
It's not a good picture, (He grabs ALADDIN and shakes him) It's not good enough for me! (He's back to normal.) Otherwise, there he is!

ALADDIN: (looking at ABU as if making a decision) Ah, reservations? You mean borders? according to their desires?
(to ABU) Some omnipotent geniuses can't bring people back to life. I don't know, Abu. He may not get us out of this hole.
Looks like we have to find a way out of here…

(They start to move, but a giant green foot moves in front of them).

GENIE: Excuse me? Are you looking at me? Are you kicking my lamp? Will you wake me up, bring me here? And suddenly Petit me?

JAFAR: ¡Uka lamparax utjañap munta!

IAGO: (JASMINE) I have the power to get away from you! I see!
We think we can keep kissing this idiot and his idiot daughter for the rest of our lives…

JAFAR: No, Iago. Just find an idiot guy. Then they'll throw us out... or behead us!

MOLEMAT: ¡Eeewww!

IAGO: (thinking) Oh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Jafar is the one? What if you were an idiot guy?

JAFAR: (He looks down at IAGO) What?

IAGO: Well, you're going to marry a princess, okay? So you have become a Sultan!

JAFAR: Ah! Marrying a mosquito? I will be the Sultan. Ideas are merit!

IAGO: Yeah, that's enough! If! And then we stoned the stepfather and the little woman! (Feeding bombs on the ground) Kersplat!

JAFAR: Iago, I love how your dirty little mind works!

(They both laugh as they walk to an oasis in the desert, where the WORM lands.)

GENIE: (Flight attendant) Thank you for choosing the Magic Carpet for all your travel wishes. Do not stop until the treadmill stops.
(As ALADDIN and ABU descend the stairs made by ALFORMA) Thank you. Goodbye! THANK YOU! Bye! (Return to Normal)
Well now. And that, Mr. Mustafa, who doubts?

ALADDIN: Oh, you showed me that well. Now for my three wishes - .

GENIUS: Are my ears deceiving me? Three? You are ONE, baby!

ALADDIN: Ah, no, I never really wanted to get out of that cave. You’re the only one who’s done it.

(GENIE thinks for a moment, then his jaw cracks. He turns into a sheep).

GENIE: Well, wasn't I stuck? Okay, baaaaad boy, but no more gifts.

ALADDIN: A fair plan. Three wishes, by the way. I want them to be successful. (GENIUS) What do you want?

(GENIE hangs like a hammock between two trees).

GENIE: Me? No one has ever asked me that before. So, for me, ah, forget it.

ALADDIN: What? Don't tell me.

GENIUS: Freedom .

ALADDIN: Are you a prisoner?

GENIUS: Everything is part and parcel, the whole concert of genius. (Becomes gigantic, voice resonates) Phenomenal cosmic powers!
(Shrink, narrow TAIL LAMP.) Small living room

ALADDIN: Genius, that's terrible.

GENIE: (Out of the lamp) But oh... to be free. Not "whoah! What do you want? pooh! What do you want? pooh! What do you want?"
To be my own master, that would surpass all the magic and treasure in the world! But what am I talking about here?
Let’s get real here. IT IS NOT THAT. Genius, wake up and smell the hummus.

ALADDIN: Why not?

GENIE: The only thing that comes out is if my master wants to leave. So you can imagine how many times this happened.

ALADDIN: I will. I will save you.

GENIE: (Her head falls to Pinocchio's with a wide eye) Um, that's right. Yell!

ALADDIN: Not true, I promise. (He pulls back his nose and Genie's brain returns to normal).
After doing my first two wishes, I will save you with my third wish. (He raises his hand)

GENIE: Well, I hope so. (He shakes hands with ALADDIN.) Very nice. Let’s do some magic. (He becomes a mage.) So what? What do you want more of?

ALADDIN: Well, there's this girl.

GENIUS: Ehhh! (Like a buzzer, and the Genie's chest shows a heart with a cross in it.) Bad. I can’t make anyone fall in love, remember?

ALADDIN: Oh, but, Genie, he's so smart and funny and.

GENIUS: Beautiful?

ALADDIN: It's great. He's got these eyes... and this hair. Wow. And his smile… [sigh].

GENIUS: (Sitting with ABU and MATO in a Parisian cafe.) Friend. It’s lovely.

ALADDIN: But she's a princess. To have a chance I'll... Hey, can you make me a prince?

GENIE: See here. (The "royal cookbook.") Chicken a la rey? (He crowns a chicken on his head) No, the Alaskan king crab.
(He removes his fingers and we see SEBASTIAN crush the crab "The Little Mermaid".) Ouch. I hate it when they do that. The Caesar salad? Ah!
(A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et Tu, Brute? No.. Aha. "Make a prince." (He gives ALADDIN a sly look.) Is this an official wish? You have to say the words.

ALADDIN: Genie, I want to make you a prince!

GENIE: Very nice! ¡That's a great one! (He gets square shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then he became a tailor/fashion designer.)
First of all, this connection between Fez and Vest is still third century . These places – what can we say – hold prayers? No! Let’s work with me here.
(He takes Aladdin's measurements, shakes his hands, and ALADDIN puts on his prince costume.) I like it, very macho! Now I want something else.
What does that tell me? It’s about the means of transportation. Sorry, monkey boy! Here, then!

(ABU tries to cover him with ALFORMA, but GENIE catches him and he runs away).

EXIT: ¡Ay!

GENIE: Here he comes (ALADDIN and GENIE are on the set of a game show where ALADDIN is standing on a podium marked "AL".)
And what better way to take on the streets of Agrabah than by riding one of your brand new camels!
Be careful, dancing! (The door opens with Genie's head, where ABU turns into a camel. He spits a track out of the side of his mouth.
But Genie doesn't know.) Mmm, not necessary. (He shrugs and ABU turns into a beautiful white horse.) It's very messy. Wait and see. What do you need to do?
(GENIUS repeatedly shrugged and changed ABU: a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57 Cadillac with the license plate "ABU 1".
(That's a thought, I'm not familiar with cars, but judging by the tail fins I can't say. Eventually it went back to normal).
If!! Esalalumbo, Shimin Dumbo, and more! Wow!! (And with the key spell, Dumbo ABU turns into an elephant.
CARPET is struggling to get away from the size of the ABU (46ft.), speaking of trunk space, watch this action!

(ABU sees the reflection in the pool of water and jumps into a tree.
The tree naturally crashes to the ground where ABU grabs it and looks upside down at ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Abu, you're so beautiful.

GENIUS: He's got a costume, he's got an elephant, but we haven't finished it yet. Hold on to your turban, kid, because we’re going to make you a star!

(We zoom in slowly to a distant oasis as fireworks begin to explode outside. Cut to a pile of toys. (Find BEASTS here.)
We kneel and SULTAN balances them. In the last piece he balances carefully , then sits up and smiles .
However, JAFAR barges in and the battery is destroyed.)

JAFAR: Sir, I have found a solution to your daughter's problem.

IAGO: Oh! A problem with your daughter!

SULTAN: Oh, really?

JAFAR: (rolls open) Here. "If the princess does not choose a husband by the appointed time, the sultan will choose one for her."

SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all the suitors! (He tries to put the cookie in Iago's mouth. IAGO backs away. SULTAN takes the cookie confused).
How can I choose someone who hates him? (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN immediately puts the biscuit in his mouth).

JAFAR: Don't worry, sir. There's more to it than that. Unless a suitable prince is found, the princess should marry… hmm… interesting.

SULTAN: What? WHO?

JAFAR: Royal Visor! Well, that could be… me!

SULTAN: Well, I think the law says only a prince can marry a princess, I'm pretty sure.

JAFAR: Troubled times call for desperate measures, sir. (He pulls out a staff and hypnotizes the SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...

JAFAR: You ordered the princess to marry me.

SULTAN: I... command... princess...... (breaks the spell momentarily)... but you are too old!

JAFAR: (approaching the wand) The princess will marry me!

SULTAN: The princess will marry... (the spell breaks again, this time to the fanfare of "Prince Ali" trumpets.)
What? What is this? This music is so good! Hahaha. Jafar, you gotta come see this!

(We see a parade advancing in the form of a GREAT GENIUS in human form).

STORIES: Tell Prince Ali!

SWORD: Hello! It’s Prince Ali!

LARGE: Oh, leading through the old bazaar, Oh you, let us pass, that's a shining new star, Oh, come, catch her eye for the first time in your neighborhood!
Make way, it's here, ring the bells, beat the drum. You will love this guy

(MAJOR is associated with various characters.) Prince Ali, how wonderful he is, Ali Ababwa! Genuflect, to bow in reverence

(ABU elephant crosses the city with ALADDIN (ALI) turned backwards.)
Try not to worry too much now. Pay for your Sunday afternoons smelling good and come meet the best people.

(IAGO dances to the music while JAFAR looks at him. LARGE "wheelbarrows" carry six men into the trunk of the ABU.
They stand shoulder to shoulder with each other as ALI shakes hands.) Prince Ali, he's great, Ali Ababwa! As strong as ten ordinary people, in fact
He faced the running group. A hundred villains with swords Who sent those fools to their masters, Why Prince Ali!

(The stack is destroyed by ALI, but GENIE(TM)'s lightning strikes the stack and he ends up holding them all in an acrobatic cart.
NERO transforms into an old man, then a child, and speaks the last two paragraphs to the audience.)

CHORUS MAN: (carrying camels) He has 75 golden camels!

(Pops here is a typical parade commentator)

HARRY: Aren't they cute, June?

WOMAN'S CHORUS: (on float) Purple peacock, 53 of them!

(Another commentator arrives).

JUNE: (Mary Hart voice) Great, Harry. I love the feathers.

GENIE: (GENIE comes off screen, a giant balloon monkey walking in the parade)
Speaking of exotic mammals, does he have a zoo, a world class zoo!

(GENIE appears as a leopard, then a goat, and says the last two lines to the first two children.
Move to the balcony, where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by a HAREM GENIE.)

GENIUS: (Voice of ETHEL MERMAN)

GIRL: (counterpoint, hearts beating) .

Prince Ali, he is handsome Ali Ababwa There is no doubt that this Ali is very attractive
This physics, how to speak Never clear, never boring Weak-kneed
Everything about this man is fascinating. Well, get out of there. He’s a miracle, he’s a genius, a miracle. Adjust your sails and get ready.
He'll break my heart To watch Prince Ali and crawl and watch! And I love her outfit!

(JASMINE looks out from the balcony of the palace.

CHORUS: He's got 95 white Persian monkeys!

(He has monkeys, See Monkeys!)

And it doesn’t cost anything to take care of them!

(He is generous, so generous)

He has slaves, slaves and helpers!

(It's an honor to work for him)

They bow to his whims, they want to serve him

They are just assholes about their loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali it is!

(ALADDIN throws off the hurrying crowd of gold coins. ABU, ALADDIN, and the procession ascend and enter the palace steps.
The SULTAN runs to the door of the throne room, but JAFAR is standing in front of the door.
It suddenly opens, led by ABU and ALADDIN, to destroy JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)

CHORUS and GENIUS: Prince Ali, love him! Ali Ababwa is the best!

GENIE: I hear your princess is a lovely sight!

And so, folks,

He got dressed and left

CHORUS: 60 elephantnaka, llamas galore

Osonakapampi, leonanakapampi

Marching band

with 40 fakirs, cooks and bakers

Their birds are chirping on one side

Make way for Prince Ali!

(More cheers ensue, with ALADDIN running behind ABU into the MAGIC ARFORM and running towards the SULTAN. JAFAR closes the door.)

SULTAN: (applause) It's amazing, it's really interesting.

ALADDIN: (draws a deeper voice.) Ahem. Your Majesty, I have come from afar to seek the hand of your daughter.

SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa! Of course. Nice to meet you. (He rushes over and shakes ALI's hand.) This is my royal visor, Jafar. He’s happy too.

JAFAR: (Very dry) Ecstatic. I’m afraid, Prince Abooboo…

ALADDIN: --Dogs!

JAFAR: It doesn’t matter. ADEQUATE. Don't just roll here uninvited and wait...

SULTAN: ...Allah, this is truly an amazing device. (He throws his pom poms, and they pull out his mustache.) I don't think I'll.

ALADDIN: Of course, your majesty. I can.

(He helps SULTANI to the ALFORMA and she drops him. JAFAR pins ALFORMA to the ground with a stick.)

JAFAR: Sir, I advise you not to.

SULTANI: -- You push the button, Jafar. Learn to have some fun.

(He shakes the stick and the WORM and the SULTAN run away. IAGO, who was standing at the end of the stick, falls,
stroke the stick with its tail every now and then as it descends.
SULTAN and CARPET fly high to the ceiling and attack with a bomb, running inside ABU, scaring him off.
The race continues in the background, and JAFAR and ALI are in the foreground talking.)

JAFAR: Where do you say?

ALADDIN: Oh, you've been fast, I'm sure. (He smiles. JAFAR doesn't).

JAFAR: Please try me. (Iago lands on the stick.)

SULTAN: Look, Polly!

(Everyone falls back in time as the WORM whistles a few inches above their heads. The WORM returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room).

IAGO: Hey, look at this. Look at him with that stupid rug!

(MATTO zooms in on IAGO, who proudly wipes his forehead, and leans against a pillar.
He hits the ground and around his head is a miniature SULTANTS ON CARPET "Have Graller, have biscuit."
The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)

SULTAN: Off, I'm coming down. Jafar, look at this! (It's going down).

JAFAR: Very impressive, Your Highness.

SULTAN: Oh, very strange. Yes, there seems to be a gift for that. (ALFORMA walks towards ABU in a daze, then falls. ABU catches him).
This guy is awesome. And the prince too. (mocking JAFAR) If we're lucky, we won't have to marry Jasmine after all.

JAFAR: I don't trust him, sir.

SULTAN: This is absurd. One of the things I pride myself on, Jafar, is that I'm a very good judge of character.

IAGO: Oh, good judge, yes, of course... no!!!

(JASMINE quietly enters).

SULTAN: Jasmine likes this!

ALADDIN: And I'm already in love with princess Jasmine!

JAFAR: Your Highness. I have to mention Jasmine. (JASMINE She gets angry.) This boy is no different.
What makes her think she’s fit for a princess?

ALADDIN: Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He hits JAFAR's goatee, which is shooting in all directions).
Let him meet me. I'll win your daughter!

JASMINE: How dare you! (Everyone looks surprised.) Are you here to celebrate the future? I am not going to win an award! (He rushes out).

SULTANI: Oh my Goddess. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Give Jasmine time to calm down. (They’re out).

JAFAR: I think it’s time to say goodbye to Prince Abooboo.

(JaSMINE and I talk on the balcony at night. We stoop to find ALADDIN and company in the courtyard).

ALADDIN: What am I supposed to do? Jasmine won't even let me talk to her. I should know that I cannot fulfill the wishes of these foolish princes.
(ABU struggles to open the banana with his watch case. He smashes it and the banana flies into his eyes.
Then he threw the banana peel into the same pile.)

GENIE: (on the carpet, playing chess) So! (ALFORMA does the same, dropping the blue line from the board.) Hello. That’s a good idea. (Rodney Dangerfield)
I can’t believe I’m losing all-in.

ALADDIN: Genius, I need help.

GENIE: (as Jack Nicholson) Well, Sparky, here's the deal. You want to clean up the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter, follow me?

ALADDIN: What?

GENIE: (Turning back to normal, holding a grenade launcher. He points to the words on the board) Tell him... THE TRUTH!!!

ALADDIN: That's not it! If Jasmine knew I was really a dirty street rat, she would laugh at me. (He wears a turban, which glows like a GENIUS).

GENIUS: A woman appreciates a man who makes her laugh! (ALADDIN removes the chain and turns on the lights. GENIUS emerges with his left turban).
Al, as an aside, you really need to behave yourself.

ALADDIN: Hey, that's the last thing. Well, I’m going to see him. I have to be gentle, cool and brave. How do you look like?

GENIE: (Sadly) Like a prince.

(ALADDIN runs to the balcony on the TAPIS. JASMINE is in bed, sobbing. RAJAH is beside her).

ALADDIN: (Jan wali jaya) ¿Princesa Jasmine?

(The RAJAH looks up and sighs).

JASMINE: Is there anyone there?

ALADDIN: Hello, Prince Ali. Ahem--(And he jumped into his deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.

JASMINE: I don't want to see you.

ALADDIN: No, no, please, princess. Give me a chance.

(The RAJAH growls and approaches him).

JASMINE: Leave me alone.

ALADDIN: Come down!

(On the other side of the balcony is the ALFORMA looking down and the GENIE below).

GENIE: How's our little friend?

(ALFORMA cuts her throat with her hand).

ALADDIN: Come on, good cat, take it and go. Kitten down to the bottom . (Takes off turban to dismiss RAJAH).

JASMINE: (Looking at him, considering his expression.) Wait, wait. Do I know you, guys?

ALADDIN: (changing his turban quickly) No, no.

JASMINE: You remind me of the man I met at the market.

ALADDIN: The market? (A bee dances round his head.) I have servants that go to market for me.
Why do I have servants who go to the market for my servants, so the person I am contacting cannot be me.

JASMINE: (with a sad expression) No, I don't think so.

BEE: (to NERO) Enough for you, Casanova. Let's talk about him! He's smart, funny, hair, eyes. What: choose a feature!

ALADDIN: Oh, Princess Jasmine, huh? You're still.

BEE: Lovely, great, amazing, spot on!

ALADDIN: Of course!

JASMINE: On time?

BEE: That's right.

ALADDIN: Wali jach'awa.

BEE: Good solution.

JASMINE: That's a little bit. I’m rich, you know.

ALADDIN: Come on!

JASMINE: The Sultan's daughter.

ALADDIN: I know.

JASMINE: A huge sum for any prince wedding.

ALADDIN: That's true. ADEQUATE. A prince like me.

BEE: (whispering in his ear) Be careful! Communication!

JASMINE: That's right, a prince like you. And I met everyone with a sweet, sassy, ​​peacock shirt!

ABJE: (Fires again, puts on glasses and falls) Mayday! Help!

JASMINE: Go jump off the balcony! (He turns and leaves) .

ALADDIN: What?

BEE: Stop him! Stop him, please! Would you like to push him?

ALADDIN: (He hits the bee) Wrong!

BEE: Well, it’s fine. But remember: just be yourself! (Bee with turban)

ALADDIN: Yes, of course!

JASMIN: What!?

ALADDIN: Er, you're right. You are not winning a prize (He looks disappointed).
You have the freedom to make your own choices. JASMINE and RAJAH look at each other in confusion.) I want to go now. (He goes up and down the hill).

JASMINE: No!

ALADDIN: (shakes his head) What? What?

JASMINE: (Shocked) How -- how do you do that? (He looks up and sees an ALFORMA).

ALADDIN: The flying carpet.

JASMINE: That's great. (MATO holds Jasmine with a pompom in her hand).

ALADDIN: You, uh, don't want to ride one, do you? We can see the world out of the palace.

JASMINE: Is it safe?

ALADDIN: Of course. Can you trust me?

JASMINE: (She looks up at him at this very important word) What?

ALADDIN: (Stretching out his hand as before) Do you trust me?

JASMINE: (letting out a smile) Yeah.

(He takes her hand and climbs onto the SHELF. Zooms into the sky and sets them both down.
"A Whole New World" music plays. JASMINE turns to see RAJAH staring at her questioningly.
She smiles as she runs over the palace wall and into the sky.)

ALADDIN: I can show you the world Brilliant, brilliant, wonderful. Princess, when was the last time you let your heart decide?

(ALFORMA zooms through town, pausing to pick up a bouquet of flowers. She hands them to ALADDIN, who hands them to JASMINE. She smiles).
Could I close your eyes Ask me On, side and under the flying carpet

(ALFORMA does as ALADDIN sings and then raises the clouds.) A new world!
A fantastic new perspective No one will say no or tell us where to go Or tell us we’re just dreaming

(SMILE Looks behind him and sees how Agrabah can't see him. THE WORM flies in and out of the clouds).

JASMINE: A new world A dazzling place I've never known. But when you're up there, it's obvious that you're in a whole new world with you now!

ALADDIN: I'm in a whole new world with you now!

(They each catch a small cloud as the WORM continues to fly. Then it spins around the column of clouds, giving it a circular shape).

JASMINE: The incredible views of the endless diamond sky of pride, grandeur, free swinging feeling speechless

(They join a flock of birds in the sky. One of them looks terrified and screams.
CARPET does somersaults and flips, occasionally sending ALADDIN and JASMINE into free fall just to catch them.
Then they zoom above the clouds, where a starry night awaits them).

JASMINE: A whole new world!

ALADDIN: Don't you dare open your eyes

JASMINE: There are a hundred thousand different things to see

ALADDIN: Hold your breath, it's going to get better!

JASMINE: I'm like a snowflake, I've come so far, I can't get back to where I was!

(They are flying over a river, apparently the Nile, because behind the sails of the ship are the Great Pyramids.
They salute the worker who bends the whole eye of the sphinx. He smiles, but you cut too hard and break his nose.)

ALADDIN: A New World!

JASMINE: Every tour is a surprise

ALADDIN: New horizons to pursue

JASMINE: Kuna minute, wila lyrics

(They run to the galloping wild horses. JASMINE waves at one of them).

BOTH: I'll follow them somewhere. It’s a free world Let me share this whole new world with you. A whole new world There we are

(They travel to Greece, where ALADDIN picks an apple from the tree and swings it in his hand towards JASMINE,
(who now knows he's dealing with ALADDIN, not Prince ALI.)

ALADDIN: That's funny

JASMINE: Great place

PANI: For you and me!

(ALFORMA floats over the sea and we see the reflection of the moon in the sea.
Fireworks explode and we see a Chinese New Year celebration couple sitting on the roof.)

JASMINE: It’s so magical.

ALADDIN: Yes.

JASMINE: (looking at him) Too bad Abu had to miss this.

ALADDIN: No, he hates fireworks. (ALFORMA looks up, realizing what's going on.) He doesn't want to fly.
(And now ALADDIN realizes) That's... oh no!

JASMINE: (takes off her turban) You market boy! I know that's it. Why did you lie to me?

ALADDIN: Jasmine, I'm sorry.

JASMINE: You thought I was stupid?

ALADDIN: No!

JASMINE: I don't think so?

ALADDIN: No, I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't. No, I don't mean that.

JASMIN: Who are you? Speak the truth!

ALADDIN: Really? (looks at ALFORMA, who signals to continue, losing hope).
The truth is, uh... the truth is, sometimes you dress up like a commoner to escape the pressures of palace life. (MATO breaks down in defeat.)
But of course I’m a prince! (A feather from his turban falls into his eyes).

JASMINE: Why didn't you tell me?

ALADDIN: Well, you know, uh... royalty go to town in disguise, which seems kind of weird, doesn't it?

JASMINE: Not so much.

(She picks up her pen and approaches him. MATO puts the pom-pom under her "chin" and looks mystified.
Darkening the outside. from the palace balcony where ALADDIN and JASMINE return. ALFORMA goes up and down the stairs.
Then ALADDIN descends under the balcony.)

JASMINE: Goodnight, handsome prince.

ALADDIN: Sleep well, princess.

(They slowly lean forward for the kiss, but MATO leans into him and they kiss faster than expected.
She slowly walked away and turned to face him. Finally, he enters the room through the curtain.)

ALADDIN: Yeah! (It lands on the carpet, which lands on the floor.) For the first time in my life, things start going well.

(Jasmine turns to her balcony and is held by four pairs of hands).

ALADDIN: Good morning! What? (A gag is attached to his mouth. Hushed voice) Abu! Abu! (We see an elephant hanging from a net tied to a tree).

ABU: Jesus?

WARNING: Hold your breath!

(They put chains on their legs and arms. Another WARNING ties them to the ARFORMA tree.)

JAFAR: I'm afraid you wear your welcome, Prince Abooboo. (He's gone.) Try never to find him.

(A GUARD kicks him in the head and he falls unconscious. Cuts to a cliff where the GUARDS laugh as Aladdin's body falls into the water.
He is conscious now, but his foot is tied to a rock. The stone hits the bottom of the lake, then the turban descends and the lamp falls.
She sees this and tries to shake the lamp. However, he lost consciousness and fell to the ground.
Worried about his movement, the lamp swivels around and sticks to his fingers. He shakes it and GENIUS comes out with a bath brush, rubber ducky and shower cap.)

GENIUS: Never fail. Take a bath and wash the lamp. (duck quack) Hi. (See ALADDIN IS NOT THERE)
Al? Al! Baby, don’t give up! You can’t fake this! I can't help you if you don't want to.
You have to say "Genius, I want to save my life." Did I get that? Light. Go to Aladdin!! (grabs ALADDIN by the arms and shakes him.
His head rises and then falls.) I like that. (Head turns into a mermaid.) Wooga! Wow! (It turned into a deep ship).
Getting to the right place! (He laughs at what he sounds like German. A huge stream of water appears on the ground and lands on the rock.
ALADDIN wakes up and spits water out of his lungs.) Don't scare me like that!

ALADDIN: Genie, I--uh, I-uh... (He can't say, so they kiss.) Thank you, Genie.

GENIUS: Oh Al. I’m starting to like you, boy. I don’t want to choose curtains or anything.

(Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing her hair. SULTANI appears in a double door, hypnotized).

SULTANI: ¡Jasmine!

JASMINE: Oh daddy, I just had the most amazing time. I’m so happy to be here.

SULTAN: (Very monotone under hypnosis) You must be, Jasmine. I have chosen a man for you.

JASMINE: What about you?

SULTAN: (Another door opens to reveal JAFAR.) You marry Jafar.

(JASMINE smiles at this).

JAFAR: You are speechless, I see. A great quality in a woman.

JASMINE: I'll never marry you. (He goes to the SULTAN) Sir, I have chosen Prince Ali!

JAFAR: Prince Ali is gone!

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in front of the balcony door).

ALADDIN: You better read your crystal ball again, Jafar!

JASMINE: Prince Ali!

(JAFAR smiles at ALADDIN).

IAGO: How the hell... (back to the parrot)... uh, awk!

ALADDIN: Tell them the truth, Jafar. You want to kill me!

JAFAR: What is it? (He walks towards the SULTAN) This is ridiculous, Your Highness. He's clearly lying. (He brings the stick closer to the SULTAN's face.)

SULTAN: Apparently... lying.

(ALADDIN sees the wand with glowing eyes).

JASMINE: Dad, what's wrong with you?

ALADDIN: I know something's wrong!

(ALADDIN grabs the staff and hits the ground. JAFAR jumps and the spell is broken forever).

SULTAN: ¡Ay, ay, ay, ¡Diosaja!

ALADDIN: Your Highness, Jafar uses you with this! (He brings the stick forward) .

SULTAN: What? Jafar is it?! You are a traitor!

(Three people lead JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Your Majesty, all of this can be explained.

SULTAN: ¡Guardanaka! ¡Guardanaka!

IAGO: Well, that's all, we're dead, forget it. Just dig a grave for them both. They were already dead.

(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket. He makes a move, but is caught by the guards).

SULTAN: Arrest Jafar immediately.

JAFAR: Not done yet, baby!

(JAFAR takes a bottle from his pocket. ALADDIN sees him and rushes towards him, but JAFAR drops it on the ground.
A large red cloud appears. When he’s gone, so is JAFAR.)

SULTAN: Find him! Look for it everywhere!

ALADDIN: Jasmine, are you alright?

JASMINE: Yeah.

(They sit down to kiss, but SULTANI comes between them).

SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted adviser, has been planning for me all this time. It’s just terrible. How can I ever - .
(He stops mid-sentence and looks at the two men.) Is that true? Has my daughter finally chosen a suitor?
(He shakes his head) Ha ha! Praise be to Allah! You're so smart boy, I can kiss you! Don’t… leave it to me… You got married at the same time!
Yes Yes. And you will be happy and prosperous, and then my son, you will be the Sultan!

ALADDIN: The Sultan?

SULTAN: Yes, an honest young man like you, of perfect conduct, is really what this kingdom needs!
(ALADDIN looks sad).

(Cut to JAFAR's apartments. JAFAR and IAGO enter.)

IAGO: We gotta get out of here! We... I need to start packing, Your Highness. Only the necessary items (IAGO starts throwing things out of the cage.
JAFAR smiles broadly.) Travel light! Bring guns, pistols, knives (stands up and takes a picture of him and JAFAR) and what do you think of this picture?
I don’t know, I think I’m making a weird face. (JAFAR starts laughing hard.) Oh boy, he's cracked. He was going crazy.
(IAGO walks up to him and pats him on the head.) Jafar! Jafar is a country! Wait! (JAFAR grabs him by the throat) Good catch!

JAFAR: Prince Ali is none of that dirty boy, Aladdin! He has a lamp, Iago.

IAGO: Why not.

JAFAR: But you can get away with it!

Iago: Me, right?

(Cut to outside the palace. ALADDIN is looking out over the gardens).

ALADDIN: The Sultan? Do they want me to be their sultan?

(GENIE comes out of the lamp)

GENIE: Huzzah! Hail to the victorious hero! (It turns into a one-man band. He sees ALADDIN heading downstairs.
He stops, shakes his head, gets an idea, then approaches ALADDIN.
He raises his hands like a director just framing a film and we watch.)
Aladdin is great! You have just won the heart of a princess. What will you do next?
(ALADDIN looks at him and goes sadly to bed, where he collapses on it and cries. GENIUS goes unconscious again,
then went to him and took out a note, which was called "Aladdin." Thank you :) Psst. Your words: "I unleash the genius." Whenever.

ALADDIN: Genius... I don't.

GENIE: Of course you do. You just say, “Geeeenie, I want you to be free. » (He holds ALADDIN's head and uses it as a ventriloquist dummy."
ALADDIN is far away.)
ALADDIN: I think so! I’m sorry, I really am. But they wanted to make me the Sultan… no! They want to act like Prince Ali Sultan. Without you I am Aladdin.

GENIE: Al, you win!

ALADDIN: Because of you! The only reason people think I’m special is because of you! What if they found out I wasn’t actually a prince?
(Calmly) What if Jasmine found out? i'm losing it. Genius, I can’t do this alone! I…I don’t want to get rid of you.

GENIE: (sarcastically) Well, I see. Of course, I lied to everyone.
Hey, I’m starting to feel left out. Now if you'll excuse me, sir... (The last word is spoken in disgust, then he turns back to the lamp).

(ABU and CARPET look out the window).

ABU: Ohoh that's a.

ALADDIN: Genie, I'm so sorry. (The tongue comes out of the tail and the raspberry.) Good, good!
(He covers the LAMP with a pillow.) So... hang on to it! (He looks at ABU and ALFORMA.) What are you looking at?
(They both leave.) Listen, I'm... I'm sorry... A-Abu, I'm sorry. I don't... wait. Come on! (He laughs.) What have I done? Nero is right.
I have to…tell Jasmine the truth.

JASMINE: (from a distance) Ali, oh Ali, are you coming here?

ALADDIN: (Puts on his turban and smiles) Well, there we go. (He enters the garden.) Jasmine? Where are you?

(We see IAGO dressed in a cape and standing on wooden sticks near a FLAMINGO in a pond. He learns JASMINE's voice).

IAGO: Huh... Make it quick on the Menager.

ALADDIN: I'm coming.

(We see ALADDIN hurry past, ignoring the birds. IAGO laughs evilly, then turns to look at the smiling FLAMINGO's face).

FLAMINGO: ¡Uh!

IAGO: There's a problem, pinky?! (He cleans the bird's feet from below.
IAGO laughs happily as he runs through the palace and finds the lamp under his pillow.)
Boy, Jafar is happy to see you! (He rubs his face like JAFAR's and imitates him).
Great job, Iago! (Normal) Ah, go ahead. (JAFAR) No, really – on a scale of one to ten, you’re… eleven!
(Normal) Oh Jafar. I'm ashamed, I'm blushing. (He ran the lamp).

(Cut to entering the palace. The SULTAN stands at the top and makes an announcement to the crowd.)

SULTAN: People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a suitor!

(Cut to the back of the curtain where JASMINE is looking. ALADDIN appears at the bottom of the stairs).

ALADDIN: Jasmine?

JASMINE: Ali, where did you go?

ALADDIN: Jasmine, let me tell you something.

JASMINE: The whole kingdom gathered for the father's announcement!

ALADDIN: No! But Jasmine, listen to me!

JASMINE: Good luck! (He throws himself onto the stage with the SULTAN, where he sees the whole crowd).

SULTAIN: ...He's a Dog!

ALADDIN: Oh God.

(At the top, IAGO and JAFAR look out the window).

IAGO: Look at them, they're shaking the little whiner.

JAFAR: Let them applaud. (He picks up the lamp and shakes it. The GENIUS comes out).

GENIE: You know Al, I (turns around and sees JAFAR) really yyyyyy - I don't know him. (He goes down and asks for the poster).
Ali's role tonight reveals a tall, dark and shadowy character.

JAFAR: I am now your master! (throws GENIE to the ground and puts her foot in GENIE's face).

GENIE: I was afraid of that.

JAFAR: Genie, grant me my first wish. I want to use it big AS SULTAN!

(Where dark clouds cut around the castle. The castle shakes. The roof cracks and the SULTAN and ALADDIN crash into each other.)

ALADDIN: ¡Waw!

SULTAN: Bless my soul. What is this? What’s going on? Oh god, what’s going on?!

JASMINE: ¡Tata!

(His turban comes off his head. When he catches him, his whole body twists, and they take off all his clothes except his boxers.
The dresses have reappeared in JAFAR.)

JAFAR: ¡Ey hey hey!

SULTAN: Jafar, you are... a vile traitor.

IAGO: For you, Sultan Vile Traitor.

ALADDIN: Oh, huh? Well, let’s see! (takes off his turban, but finds it empty) Lamp!

JAFAR: Interrogator- viewers, Abooboo.

(They both look up to see a giant GENIUS take the palace into the sky. ALADDIN blows his whistle and MATTO runs to greet him.
They fly right next to GENI's head.)

ALADDIN: He's a bastard! No!

GENIE: Sorry, kid, I have a new boss now. (He puts it on the palace hill).

SULTAN: Jafar, I must leave you alone!

JAFAR: Ah, but now there's a new order... MY order! You've finally bowed to me!

(SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not).

JAFAR: We will NEVER bow down to you!

IAGO: Why wasn't I surprised?

JAFAR: If you would not bow to the Sultan, you would bow to the Witch!
(to GENIE) Genie, my second wish: I want to be the most powerful wizard in the world!

ALADDIN: Nero!

(GENIE reaches out. ALADDIN tries to stop him, but fails, and another GENIE(tm) trademark lightning strikes JAFAR, restoring him to his normal form.)

IAGO: Brothers and sisters, welcome to Agrabah, Wizard Jafar!

JAFAR: Jichhax kawkhans jikxatasipxta? ¡Ah jïsa, mä jach’a jisk’achawi! (Jupax JASMINE ukat SULTAN jupanakaruw thujrupamp jawq’jatayna ukat panpachaniw jupar qunqurt’asipxäna.

in any case. I've got to step back and sort things out. (She starts walking in the snow and ends up walking on a frozen carpet).
Rug! (He looks up and sees ALFORMA tied to the pole. He pulls down to try to free ALFORMA.
He can't do it, so he starts clearing the snow from the base of the pillar.) Abu, start digging! Of course!
(Eventually, enough snow is removed and the pillar begins to sway. ALADDIN runs off, looks back, and sits down.
The pillar rolls down on him, and as he disappears, ALADDIN and ABU find themselves sitting in the crack formed by the window of the pillar.)
If! Light! (He looks at the turban he made with a frightened ABU. MATO splashes snow and runs to pick it up).
Now back to Agrabah! Let’s go!

(We go back to a great exterior shot of Agrabah covered in red clouds. Cut to a slight zoom interior of the throne room.
IAGO is tied to the SULTAN as a doll, and JASMINE is chained to the throne.)

IAGO: Does the puppet master want some cookies? These are cookies. Throw it all down your throat. It’s okay here!

(JAFAR removes the chain and JASMINE approaches with an apple).

JASMINE: Don't give up! Jafar, leave him alone!

(IAGO pauses, then continues).

JAFAR: I think it’s so sad you become this person, Jasmine. (He bites the apple he is holding.) A desert flower as beautiful as you must be in the hands of the greatest man in the world. (He shakes his hand and the crown appears.) What do you say dear? Why, when you’re the queen…

(Takes a glass of wine and throws it in his face).

JASMINE: Absolutely!

JAFAR: I want to teach respect! (He falls back as he raises his hand to hit her. Then he stops.) No Genie... I decided to do the last thing I wanted. I wanted Princess Jasmine to fall in love with me unexpectedly.

(JASMINE screams. We see ALADDIN running back to town).

GENIE: (Again as Buckley) Ah, master... there are a few extras, quid pro quo.

JAFAR: Don't answer me, you great villain! YOU did what I told you to do…slave!

(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN by the window, beckoning for a game).

JASMINE: (She rises and puts the crown on her head.) Jafar! Um, I never realized how... incredibly beautiful you are.

(Slap of NERO).

JAFAR: Mm, that's better. (Raises NERO's chin darkly.) Now... Kitty, tell me more... about myself.

JASMINE: You're... big... and dark...

JAFAR: Yeah?

JASMINE: Well dressed...

(JAFAR approaches him. ALADDIN jumps in with ABU and GENIE sees them).

GENIE: Al! Al, jisk'a friend!

ALADDIN: ¡Shh!

GENIE: (Literally opens and closes his mouth.) Al, I can't help it, I'm working for a master psycho right now. (His head becomes JAFAR and back).

ALADDIN: Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? (He closes the GENI's mouth.) I improvise.

(He tosses a stack of coins and hides next to JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR backs away from ALADDIN.)

JAFAR: Jatka and so on.

JASMINE: And your beard is... well... curly! You stole my heart... (She wraps her arms around him.
He pretends to put his arm around her, but in reality ALADDIN is calling for her to come. He makes his walk. IAGO observes.)

IAGO: Gag--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth).

JAFAR: What's a street rat?

JASMINE: Any street rats?

(They're about to kiss when IAGO manages to splash the pot. JAFAR turns to look at him, but JASMINE catches him and kisses him.
ALADDIN looked serious. (IAGO and ABU look angry).

ABU JA IAGO: Nothing!

JAFAR: It's... (he sees ALADDIN's reflection in his crown.) YOU! How many times do you have to kill, boy?!

(She snarls at ALADDIN. JASMINE runs at her and she falls to the ground. ALADDIN quickly grabs the stick).

ALADDIN: Take the lamp!

(JASMINE runs towards him. But JAFAR chokes ALADDIN, sending him into the hourglass).

JAFAR: No! Ah-ah-ah, princess... Your time is up!

ALADDIN: Jasmine!

(Sand starts falling on him from the sky).

IAGO: Ooh, good move, Jaf-- (He gets knocked out by ABU.)

(ABU runs towards the lamp).

JAFAR: Don't play with me! (He turns into a toy monkey).

ALADDIN: ¡Abu!

(TAPIT arrives soon.)

JAFAR: Things are moving fast now, baby! (JAFAR laughs as the ALFORMA is opened and dismantled.
ALADDIN runs to the lamp again.) Understand? (His path is covered with giant swords).
JAFAR grabs the lamp and laughs menacingly. ALADDIN pulls the sword from the ground.) Just warming up! (He spits the Ring of Fire around ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Are you afraid to fight me about yourself, you cowardly snake?!

JAFAR: Snake, right? Maybe you want to see how I look like a snake! (He smiles widely and we see a snake mouth sticking out from behind his teeth.
It then transforms into a giant cobra and the ring of fire around ALADDIN is part of the serpent around ALADDIN.
JAFAR the snake walks towards ALADDIN and on the third attempt ALADDIN swings the sword and hits JAFAR. (To the GENIE cheerleaders wearing A-line sweaters.)

GENIES: Rickem, rockem, racem, rake - hit that sword on that snake!

JAFAR: Get away from it!

(GENIE points to a small pennant with a “J” on it.)

GENIE: (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man. If he can’t do it, AWESOME!

(ALADDIN uses a distraction to break the hourglass, caught by JASMINE. However, JAFAR notices and blocks the way.
ALADDIN falls and loses his sword.)

JASMINE: Aladdin!

(ALADDIN jumps on a giant jewel and rolls it to the ground, grabbing the sword as he goes.
He rounds the corner, but the pursuing snake fails, and JAFAR's forehead crashes through the wall and crushes him outside the palace.
ALADDIN jumps on the back of the snake and stabs it. JAFAR screamed in agony. ALADDIN tries again to rescue the princess.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine, suyt’am!

(He's about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him).

JAFAR: (laughs evilly) You little fool! Do you think you can beat the strongest animal on Earth?!

IAGO: (Coming from behind GENIE) Fuck him, Jafar. It’s like… awk! (GENIE shakes him)

JAFAR: Without genius, my son, you are nothing!

ALADDIN: (a thought) Genius. Genius! Genie is stronger than you!

JAFAR: What?!

ALADDIN: He gave me your powers! He can pull it off!

GENIE: Al, what are you doing? Why have you brought me here?

ALADDIN: Believe me, Jafar! You’re still just…second best!

JAFAR: You’re right! His power is stronger than mine. But not for long…

(JAFAR rotates around GENIUS).

GENIUS: This guy is crazy. He's a little drunk. Someone had too many shots with a snake. (His hand becomes a snake and he hits his head with it).

JAFAR: Slave! I’m making my third wish! I… want to be ALL GENIUS!

GENIE: (reluctantly) Very nice. Your desires are the rules. Well done, Al.

(GENIE breaks JAFAR with a final GENIE(tm)-marked lightning bolt). JAFAR's snake form dissolves and he becomes a spirit.
We see JASMINE'S long arm disappear into the sand. ALADDIN runs over and ends up breaking the glass. (Sand and Princess Jasmine fall).

JAFAR: Yeah... Yeah! Power... Absolute power!

JASMINE: (to ALADDIN) What have you done?

ALADDIN: Believe me!

(A blue lamp appears at JAFAR's base. JAFAR cast a spell).

JAFAR: The universe is mine! Consider!

ALADDIN: Don't worry, Jafar! Are you forgetting something?

JAFAR: (looking questioningly) Heavy?

ALADDIN: You want to be a genius? You’ve got that!

(Chains on JAFAR's wrists).

JAFAR: WHAT?!

ALADDIN: And everything that goes with it!

JAFAR: Hey! NO!

IAGO: I'm leaving!

ALADDIN: Phenomenal Cosmic Powers!

(IAGO tries to run, but is caught by JAFAR.)

IAGO: Come on, you're a genius! I don't want to, I don't want to--!

ALADDIN: A very small dwelling.

GENIUS: Al, you little genius, you!

(ABU returns to normal, MATO parades again, JASMINE, SULTAN and RAJAH stand together.
The RAJAH jumps into the arms of the SULTAN, and everyone changes. The SULTAN is crushed under the weight of the new RAJAH.
The palace is back where it was in the city. ALADDIN carries a new lamp.)

JAFAR: (both from under the lamp.) Get your tail off my face!

IAGO: Oh, shut up, you idiot!

JAFAR: Don't tell me to shut up!

GENIE: I'm sorry. (He takes the lamp and goes to the balcony. He's got a cap on now.
Finally, he tried to throw the lamp away, but when he opened his hand, he threw his hand into the desert.)
Let ten thousand years of Wonder's Cave rest him!

(Jafar and Iago continue arguing as they disappear. Jasmine walks towards Aladdin. They hold hands, but both look sad).

Aladdin: Jasmine, I'm sorry I lied about the prince.

Jasmine: I know why.

Aladdin: Well, I guess...this...this is goodbye? (GENIE cocks her head in the corner, startled by what she hears).

Jasmine: Oh this stupid slave. It’s not right! I love you.

Genie: (wipes a smile) Al, okay. I've got a little more need for you. Just say the word and you’ll be a prince again.

Aladdin: But Genie, what about your free life?

Genie: Hey, it's just perpetual slavery. It’s lovely. (He sits down next to her).
Al, you will not in a million years find another girl like her. Believe me, I know. I'm looking at it.

Aladdin: I love you, Jasmine, but... I have to stop pretending to be nothing.

Jasmine: I see it.

(They make eye contact for the last time, and ALADDIN turns back to NERO).

Aladdin: Genie, I want you to be free.

Genius: The true pedigree of the future prince. What do I have ?

Aladdin: (He holds the lamp towards GENIE.) Genie, you're free!

(A transformation scene follows, where the chains fall from GENIE's wrist and the lamp uselessly falls to the ground. GENIE picks it up and looks at it).

Genie: (Disbelieving.) Hey, hey! I’m free to go. I’m free to go. (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.) Quickly, quickly, want something special.
Say, "I want the Nile." The love of the Nile. Try it out!

Aladdin: I'm waiting for the Nile.

Genie: It’s not like that! (Laughs hysterically. He runs like a pinball machine on the balcony.) Oh, it feels good! I am free! I was finally free!
I’m about to hit the road. I want to explore the world! I--

(He picks up his suitcase, but looks down at ALADDIN who looks very worried).

Aladdin: Genie, I love you.

Genie: I'm sorry, Al. (sniff) No matter what anyone says... you would be a prince to me.

(They kiss. The Sultan steps forward).

Sultan: That’s true. In fact, you have proved my point of view. This rule creates a problem .

Jasmine: ¿Tata?

Sultan: Well, am I a Sultan or am I a Sultan? From now on the princess will marry whomever she deems fit.

Jasmine: (With a smile on her face, she runs into ALADDIN's arms.) Him! I choose... I choose you, Aladdin.

Aladdin: Hello. Please call me Al.

(They're about to kiss when giant green arms bring them all together. Genie is wearing a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat).

Genie: Oh, all of you. Come here. Great group hug! Group hug, oops! Do you mind if I kiss a monkey? (He kisses Abu).
Oh hairball! Well, you can't do any more wrong around this ice cream cone. I'm going to leave! Well, you two crazy lovebirds!
Hello, Rugman: ciao! I’m like history! No, I am a mythologist! No, I don't care what I am, I am free!

(The Genie flew into the blue sky, leaving behind a sparkler.
They cut (a jump cut is made worse by the fireworks show at night. We made the mistake of seeing Aladdin and Jasmine running on the carpet.)

[Aladdin] .
A new era
[Jasmine] .
A whole new life
Both:
(off-camera chorus) For you and me!
[chacha chorus].
A new world!
(After they run in the moonlight, and disappear, the moon returns to reveal NERO's funny face.
Suddenly the film cuts out of the "projector", GENIUS magnifies and focuses on the audience.)

Genie: I made it look.

(Return movie to normal, moon back to normal. Black fading)


Aladdin is a brother

(Fade to black. Hip of purple mist in front of a wall of red fire.

(On the street at night, a merchant gets up from his camel and talks to us)

[camellox jachaqt'asiskiwa].

Peddler: Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. Get a little closer.
(Camera zooms in and hits the shopkeeper's face) Too close. A little too close .
(He turns his face away from the camera slightly) There we go. Welcome to Agrabah, the city of mystery, enchantment, .
(Camel bag opens which becomes bazaar stall) and even better stuff here in Jordan, on sale today.
I'm going to disappear. Uh huh. Let's take a look at it. If. Hookah and coffee makers together . Also make julienne potatoes . There is no condemnation. (she taps the table) no.
It was broken. So it’s a good idea! Let's take a look at it. (Takes Tupperware) Never seen one intact before. This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware .
Hear. (He opens it, hears raspberry..) Ah, that's good. (The camera starts panning to the right. The merchant rushes to catch up with him.) Wait, don't go there! (Stop the page.)
You realize that you know better than anything exceptionally rare. I guess it's good then, come to think of it.
(The vendor pulls the iconic Magic Lamp from his sleeve.) Don’t let its worldly appearance fool you.
Like so many other things, it's not what's on the outside that counts, it's what's on the inside. (Another page, this one further to the left.
Again the salesman rushes in.) This is no ordinary lamp! It changed the young man's life.
The boy who loved the lamp was more than he was. A diamond is rough. Maybe you want to hear a story?
(The merchant pours the shiny dust from the lamp onto his hands).
The dark night begins... (The merchant throws ashes into the sky where it creates a starry night.) where a dark man waits with dark intent.

(The camera moves to show Jafar sitting on his horse, Iago sitting on his shoulder. Gazeem approaches them).

[nickelanaka horse].

Jafar: You're late.

Gazeem: Many apologies, oh Patient One.

Jafar: So you have it?

Gazeem: I had to cut some throats, but I did it. (He pulls out half of the locket. Jafar grabs it, but Gazeem pulls it out.) Ah-ah-ahhh. Treasure. (Iago shouts as Iago passes and grabs the locket.) Oh!

Jafar: Trust me, my friend. You find what comes to you.

Iago: What's wrong with you? So it’s a good idea!

(Jafar takes the other half of the locket. It interacts with them and forms a golden beetle. It lives and flies away).

Jafar: Hurry up! Follow the path!

(On horseback, the three of them chase the locket through the moonlit desert)

It's much faster!

(The creature splits into two parts, each half of which sits on a sand dune. Protruding from the dune is a large tiger head 'the sword of the sword of the sword of the sword of the sword of the sword of the sword of the sword of the sword of the sword snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow .
Men's horses rear up on their hind legs and throw their horses. Jafar smiles as the tiger head opens its hollow mouth.)

[horse screams].

[cold wail]

Jafar: Finally after all the years of searching, Wonder Hole.

Iago: Awk. Hole of Wonders!

Gazeem: ( whispering) By Allah...

Jafar: Now you have to decide. Bring me the lamp! The rest is yours, but the lamp is mine. [laugh]

(Gazeem begins to approach the lion's mouth, the entrance to the cave. He laughs as he walks away).

Iago: Oh lamp. Oh, the lamp. (Now it's just Iago and Jafar, Iago opens up in normal English.) Damn, where did you find that bozo?

(Jafar puts his hand over his mouth and silences him. Gazeem crawls towards the entrance to the mouth of the cave.
He's looking deep into her mouth as her lips turn into a staircase.
He stuck in one of the tiger's teeth, but was startled by the sound of voices in the cave).

Cave: [echo growling] Who disturbed my sleep?

Gazeem: [the thief snorts] I, Gazeem, humble thief.

P'iya: Mo uka. Only one gets in, the one whose value is far away. A diamond is rough.

(Gazeem turns to Jafar with a questioning look).

Jafar: What are you waiting for? Jack.

[animal's pride]

(Gazeem hesitates, then goes inside the cave. Still nervously with his foot down. Nothing happens. He calmly starts walking again. Then he hears another scream. He turns around, but Lion's mouth closes and the dune collapses and back to normal.Only Jafar remains, Iago and two separate half medals.)

Jafar: Now!

Hole: Find a diamond in the rough.

Iago: [coughs] I can't believe it. I don’t believe it! We’ll never get our hands on that stupid lamp! Forget about it! Let's take a look at it. Let's take a look at it.
I was so tickled and wanted to piss. (He runs into Jafar's arms).

Jafar: Be patient, Iago. Patience. Gazeem was not good enough.

Iago: (very sarcastic) Oh, it's a big surprise. It’s unbelievable… I think I’m going to die of this weird heart attack.
What are we going to do? We have a big problem here, a big- (Jafar pinches his beak.)

Jafar: Yes. Only one can enter. I need to find this, this… diamond.

(Cut to the ceiling, where Aladdin runs up the hill with the bread. He nearly falls to the top).

Razoul: Don't give up! Thief! I'll take the trophy from you, street rat!

Aladdin: (Looks back, then down, then towards the bread.) All this for bread? Oooooh!

(He jumps and lands on two ropes tied between buildings, clothes drying on top. He throws them into the air, picking up his own clothes as he walks. He finally approaches the end of the rope by the window as a woman waves and dances in the blinds .Aladdin hits the shutters and falls into the street, his fall shattering several awnings and a pile of clothes around him. He takes off his clothes on the top floor and is about to suck on his bread. when...)

Guard 1: There!

Guard 2: You won't get past this easily!

Aladdin: Did you think that was easy?

(He looks at the three women and mocks them).

Razoul: You two, this way, and you, follow me. We’ll find him.

(Aladdin puts on a sheet and covers himself to disguise himself. He rushes to the women).

Aladdin: Hello, ladies.

Woman 1: We've had a bit of trouble this morning, haven't we, Aladdin?

Aladdin: The problem? Now it doesn’t exist. You only get into trouble if you get caught.

(A hand grabs Aladdin's arm and pulls him back. It's Razoul. Aladdin's mask falls).

Razoul: I got you!

Aladdin: I'm in trouble.

Razoul: And this time... (Abu shouts, and the guard's turban is pulled over his eyes. Abu points to the guard's head, laughing).

Aladdin: Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

Ash: Ash.

Aladdin: Come on. Let’s get out of here. i'm.

(The guard tosses Aladdin, but destroys the fish barrel. Abu waddles the guard, then dodges the attack. Aladdin then drops the guard's pants)

♪ A jump before the end ♪

♪ Slightly forward ♪

♪ I only steal what I can't sell ♪ That's all.

(Aladdin runs away, the guard gives him the fish like pants from his lower body).

♪ One step ahead of the rule ♪

♪ So now it's a joke ♪

♪ These guys don't like me being broke! ♪

(Aladdin and Aby climb a pile of barrels and avoid the guards).

♪ ¡Calle instalment! ♪

♪ Deceiver! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Just a little snack, guys. ♪

Guard: ♪ Tear it up, take it back, guys! ♪

(Aladdin runs upstage. The guards rock the stage back and forth to try and pull him down).

Aladdin: ♪ I see ♪

♪ I have to face facts ♪

(Aladdin leaps from the stage to his literal death to grab Abu’s arms like an acrobat. The two of them hover in the harem).

♪ ¡Juma sapakïtawa, Abu! ♪

Harem Girls: Who?

Woman 2: ♪ I want to blame the parents, or he didn’t give up. ♪

Aladdin: ♪ I must eat to live,

♪ Will tell you all about it when I have time! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu get out and run to the awning. They cut down a muscular man kneeling in front of the crowd.
The guards quickly left. Cut to Aladin and Abu following the muscular man as he walks to make mistakes and be seen. )

♪ One step before I lost. ♪

♪ Next time I'll name a pen. ♪

Razoul: There he is!

(Sequence where Aladdin and Abu, pursued by guards, run through a flock of sheep and pounce on the sleeping artist on a nail bed [actually still the large guard lands on him])

Aladdin: ♪ Jump in front of the assassins ♪

♪ One step ahead of the pack ♪

♪ I think I'm going to go for a walk in the neighborhood ♪

Man 1: ♪ Don't stop, thief! ♪

Aljiri 1: 🔥 ¡Vandal! 

Aladdin: ♪ ¡Abu! ♪

Woman 3: ♪ Scandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Don't move too fast ♪

(Aladdin is surrounded by GUARDS in front of the door. The door opens and a tall, ugly woman enters)

Woman: ♪ I think that’s cool though! ♪

(Aladdin kneels down and shakes hands with the guard, acting like everyone is a friend).

Aladdin: ♪ I have to eat to live, ♪

♪ I can steal food ♪

♪ Otherwise, good luck! ♪

Guard: NO!!!

(The guards jump on Aladdin, but are shot. His paint rolls onto the pots)

Leader: Get him!

(Aladdin jumps at the artist, who is walking harmlessly through the hot ashes. The guards run through the ashes, burning their feet and jumping in agony.
Aladdin and Abu encounter a sword eater, and Abu turns around to remove the sword from the eater's mouth. (Abu goes to the guards, who stand in fear).

Guard: He has a sword!

Razoul: You idiots. We all have swords!

(The guards draw their swords. Abu lowers his sword and runs away. Aladdin and Abu are surrounded again, guards coming from left and right.
(He jumps up and climbs onto a stunt suit that goes down the street as all the guards shoot each other).

Aladdin: ♪ A leap before my feet ♪

Guardianaka: ¡Vandal!

Aladdin: ♪ A leap before the hump ♪

Guardianaka: Rat Street!

Aladdin: ♪ One turn before disaster strikes ♪

Guardianaka: ¡Trickster!

Aladdin: ♪ They move fast, but I'm faster ♪

Guard: Pick it up!

(The guards chase Aladdin up the stairs into the room. He grabs the rug...)

Aladdin: ♪ Well, ♪

♪ You better have your hands on ♪

♪ I wish you a better world, ♪

♪ All you have to do is jump! ♪

(..then jumps out the window like the carpet is magic. The guards chase him out the window, but they fall right into the street and land on a fertilizer cart with a sign that says "Mad Hakim's Discount Fertilizer.")

Guards: Happy! Hey!

(Aladdin uses the carpet as a parachute to land safely. Aladdin and Abu greet each other)

Aladdin: And now, honored effendi, we feast. Light.

(Aladdin cuts the bread in half and gives half to ABU, who begins to eat.
But Aladdin looks up and sees two little kids looking for food in the garbage can.
The girl sees it, then throws away what she's found and tries to hide. Aladdin looks down at them, then at the bread, then at Abouta.)

Abu: Nam, nam! Voi ei.

(Abou takes a big bite of his food, but Aladdin gets up and approaches the children. The girl pushes her brother back).

Aladdin: [sighs] This is great. Jack. You have to take it.

[laruña]

[inach'usaru]

Abu: Ah, don't do that. Or is it a ?

Man: On Palace Road, I think. Another suitor for the princess.

[hintasa].

Prince Ahmed: Out of my way, brats.

Aladdin: Hey! If I were as wealthy as you, I would have the money of success.

Prince Ahmed: That’s good. I will teach you to walk!

[the men laugh].

[grimace] and so on.

Aladdin: Look, Abu. It's not every day you see a horse with two hindquarters.

Audience: Wow!

Prince Ahmed: Ha! You're a worthless street rat. You are born a street rat, you die a street rat and only fleas cry for you.

Aladdin: I'm useless. And I don’t have fleas. [sighs] Come on, Abu. Let’s go home.
♪ Riffraff, street snow. I didn't buy it. If only they had looked more closely. Did they see the poor boy? Not the father. They think I have a lot more to do. ♪
One day Abu, things will change. We are rich, we live in a palace, and we never have problems.

[roosters crow].

Prince Ahmed: I've never been so humiliated.

Sultan: Oh Prince Ahmed. You wouldn’t leave that early, would you?

Prince Ahmed: Good luck marrying her.

Sultan: Ah! Jasmine was like that. Jasmine is alright! Jasmine is alright! Jasmine is alright!

[murisee] .

Sultan: Change it, Rajah. That's why Prince Ahmed went so hard.

Jasmine: Oh, Dad. Rajah continued to play with him.
Isn't that true, Rajah? You're playing the overdressed, self-promoting Prince Ahmed, aren't you?

[both laugh].

[clears throat]

Sultan: My dear, you must not turn down all the suitors who invite you. The law states that.

Both: You’re marrying a prince…

Sultan: Until the next birthday.

Jasmine: The law is wrong.

Sultan: Only three days.

Jasmine: Dad, I hate this. When I get married, I want it to be a marriage of love.

Sultan: Jasmine...it's not just this rule. I won’t be here forever, well, I just… I want you to be taken care of. Anticipated slowly.

Jasmine: Try to understand. I never did anything on my own. I never had any real friends.

[inach'usaru]

Jasmine: Except you, Rajah. I never left the palace walls.

Sultan: But Jasmine, you are a princess.

Jasmine: So maybe she doesn't want to be a princess anymore.

Sultan: Oooh! I...I...Allah forbade you from having daughters.

Diagram: Hmm?

Sultan: I don’t know where he got it. His mother wasn't too hard on him. I see! Ah, Jafar . My most trusted adviser. I want your knowledge.

Jafar: My life is just serving you, sir.

Sultan: That’s a boon for suitors. Jasmine does not want to choose a man. I am at the end of the thread.

Iago: Aha! Finish the rope!

Sultan: [laughs] Oh! A biscuit, good Polly.

Jafar: [Jafar laughs] Your Majesty knows how to fool sure animals.

[Iago murisee] .

Jafar: Now maybe we need to figure out a solution to this complicated problem.

Sultan: If anyone can help, you can.

Jafar: But you'd have to use Mystic Blue Diamond for that.

Sultan: That's right. Oh my ring? But it has been in the family for many years.

Jafar: We need to find a suitor for the princess. Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

Sultan: Everything will be fine.

Jafar: It’s a diamond.

Sultan: Here, Jafar. Everything you need is well equipped.

Jafar: You are very kind, liege. Now run and play with your little toys, hmm?

Sultan: Yes. It’s going to be pretty cool.

Iago: [spitting, snoring] I can't take it anymore! If I had to choke on one more of those disgusting moldy cookies... Bam! Hit!

Jafar: Calm down, Iago.

Iago: And I caught his head. Hit!

Jafar: Soon, I'll be the Sultan, not this deranged idiot.

Iago: And then I threw cookies down his throat. Ha, ha!

[inach'usaru]

Jasmine: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here, I can live my life for me too. I will miss you.

[inach'usaru]

Jasmine: That’s right.

[customers call].

Aladdin: Well, Abu. Go.

Melon Vendor: Try this. Your flavors dance and sing.

[screaming]

Melon Seller: Hands off.

[cocktail] .

Melon Seller: Well, you... Get out of here, bloody dirty monkey!

Abu: Good morning.

Aladdin: Well, Abu.

[maltisiwi]

Aladdin: Breakfast.

Food vendor: Good woman, buy a bowl. There could be no finer dish made of brass or silver.

Nut seller: Sweet dates. Sweet dates and figs. Sweet dates and pistachios.

Necklace salesman: Should a woman wear a necklace? A beautiful necklace for a beautiful woman.

Fish vendor: Fresh fish! We caught them, you bought them!

Jasmine: Okay now. I don't believe it. I see!

[swallow]

Jasmine: That’s fine.

[a slight drink]

[burps] and so on.

Jasmine: I’m really, really sorry.

Aladdin: Well done.

Abu: Uh. How do I live? How do I live?

Jasmine: Oh, you must be hungry. Here’s the existing one.

Apple Merchant: You better pay for it.

Jasmine: Jig?

Apple Seller: Now you stole my cart.

Jasmine: Oh, my, sir. I don't have the money.

Apple seller: Thief!

Jasmine: Please... If you let me go to the palace, I can get it from the Sultana.

Apple Retailer: Do you know what the theft crime is?

Jasmine: Now! Now Thank You!

Aladdin: Thank you, good sir. I am so glad you found it. I'm looking for you everywhere.

Jasmine: What are you doing?

Aladdin: Play the game.

Appleseller: And you, now, this girl?

Aladdin: Unfortunately, yes. She’s my sister. He's a little crazy.

Apple seller: He said he knew the Sultan.

Aladdin: He thinks that monkey is the Sultan.

Jasmine: Oh wise Sultan, how can I serve you?

[crap]

Aladdin: Sad, isn't it? But there is no problem. Now come on, sister. It’s time to go to the doctor.

Jasmine: Hello, Doctor. How is this going to happen?

Aladdin: Now, now, now. Don’t be afraid. Come on, Sultan.

[attacks, tears].

Apple customer: Great? What? Come back here, little thieves!

[explosion] .

Iago: With all due respect, rat, can't we just wait for a real storm?

Jafar: Hold your breath, Iago. More immediately.

Iago: Yes, mighty Evil one. [flushes] .

Jafar: Nothing, the sands of time. Tell me who's in the cave. If! If! Here’s the existing one. My diamond is hard.

Iago: Is he right? Is this the payoff you've been waiting for?

Jafar: Let's give the guards an invitation to the palace, okay?

Iago: It's great. [cough]

[sad laughter]

Aladdin: I'm already there.

Jasmine: I want to thank you for protecting this man.

Aladdin: Forget it. So, this is your first time in the market, right?

Jasmine: Is it that clear?

Aladdin: Well, you're famous. I mean, you wouldn't know how dangerous Agrabah would be.

Jasmine: Hmm. I'm a quick learner.

Ash: Wow.

Aladdin: [laughs] Hello. Come on. Such. Wow. Keep your head in there . Be careful.

Jasmine: Do you live here?

Aladdin: Yes. I'm with Abumpiki. Come, go as you please.

Jasmine: That’s amazing.

Aladdin: Well, there’s not much, but it’s amazing to see. Wow. The palace looks really amazing, doesn't it?

Jasmine: Oh, that’s lovely.

Aladdin: I wonder what it would be like to live here, with servants and servants.

Jasmine: Absolutely. People telling you where to go and how to dress.

Aladdin: Better than this. Always looking for food and dodging guards .

Jasmine: You are not free to decide for yourself.

Aladdin: Sometimes it's.

Jasmine: You just.

Both: ...trap.

Aladdin: [clears throat] So where are you from?

Jasmine: What does it matter? I ran away and didn't come back.

Aladdin: Really? How can it be so?

Abu: Well you.

Jasmine: My father is forcing me to marry him.

Aladdin: It's... terrible. Abu!

[angry smile]

Jasmine: What about you?

Aladdin: Abu says, uh... that's not fair.

Abu: What is it?

Jasmine: Oh, huh?

Aladdin: Yes, of course.

Jasmine: And does Abu have anything else to say?

Aladdin: Well, he hopes to do something to help her.

Abu: Yes way.

Jasmine: Hmm. Tell him that’s cool.

Razoul: Oh well.

Both: They're after me! You?

Jasmine: My father must have sent them…

Aladdin: Can you trust me?

Jasmine: What about you?

Aladdin: Can you trust me?

Jasmine: Yeah …

Aladdin: Then jump!

Razoul: We kept running, didn't we, street rat?

Aladdin: Run away! Go! Get out of here!

Razoul: Take it from me! This is a prison for you, kid.

Aladdin: I have to leave.

Jasmine: He has to leave.

Razoul: Look here, guys. That's a snowflake!

[the guards laugh].

Jasmine: Must leave at the request of the Princess.

Razoul: Princess Jasmine.

Aladdin: ¿Mà Princesa?

Abu: Princess?

Razoul: What are you doing outside the palace? And this street rat.

Jasmine: It's not your problem. Just do as I say. Let him go, please.

Razoul: I wish, princess, or the orders must come from Jafar. Talk to him about it.

Jasmine: Believe me, I will. Jafar is the one?

Jafar: Oh princess.

Iago: Aha! Jafar, I'm stuck.

Jafar: How can I help you?

Jasmine: The guards only took the boy to the market at your request.

Jafar: Your father charged me with peace in Agrabah. The boy was a bad guy.

Jasmine: What's his fault?

Iago: I can't breathe, Jafar.

Jafar: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.

Iago: If you... Aah! That is annoying!

Jasmine: He didn't kidnap me. I was running away.

Jafar: Oh my dear. Oh, how wonderful. I’ve had it, but I know…

Jasmine: What do you mean?

Jafar: Unfortunately, the young man’s sentence has already been served.

Jasmine: Kuna phrasesa?

Jafar: Death.

[Jasmine's son].

Jafar: Mestatamamma .

Jasmine: Now.

Jafar: I'm so sorry, princess.

Jasmine: How do you do that? [huge]

Iago: [cough] [cough, gasp] Well, how did it go?

Jafar: I think he carried himself well.

Jasmine: [Jasmine cries] It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn’t even know his name.

[The Rajah interrupts].

Aladdin: She was a princess. I don't believe it. I must have looked silly to him.

Abu: Yoo-hoo! Aladdin is great! Good morning!

Aladdin : Abu . Here.

[screaming]

Aladdin: Come on, help me out of here.

[punishment].

Aladdin: Hey, he was in trouble. Ah, he’s good enough.

Abu: Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

Aladdin: Don't worry. I will never see him again. I’m a street rat, remember? And there is a rule. She must marry the prince. She deserves a prince.

Object: Wow!

Aladdin: I'm a fool.

Old Jafar: You are a fool to leave, son.

Aladdin: Who are you?

Old Jafar: A humble prisoner like you. But together we can be more.

Aladdin: I'm listening.

Old Jafar: There's a cave, child, a wondrous cave, full of treasures beyond your wildest dreams...

Abu: You're right!

Old Jafar: I bet you have enough treasure to make your princess too.

Iago: Jafar, can you hurry? I’m dying for it. [jafar punches him].

Aladdin: But the rule is that only a prince can.

Old Jafar: You've heard of the Golden Rule, haven't you? Whoever owns the gold makes the rules. [laughter laughter]

Aladdin: Yes. Why would you share all these wonderful treasures with me?

Old Jafar: I need young legs and a strong back to go.

Aladdin: The problem. There's a guy. We’re here to stay.

Chief Jafar: Uh. Things are not as simple as they seem. So do we have a deal?

Abu: Oh, I don't know.

[snowflakes]

P'iya: Yes. Who disturbs sleep?

Aladdin: Sorry, Aladdin.

P'iya: Continue. Do not touch anything other than the lamp.

Old Jafar: Remember, son, first bring me a lamp, and you will receive your reward.

Aladdin: Come on, Abu.

[screaming]

Aladdin: I want to know!

[inach'usaru]

Aladdin: Only a few of those things would make me richer than the Sultan. Abu!

[white]

Aladdin: Don't... touch... anything. We need to find the lamp.

Abu: [grunts] Or? Aladdin is great!

Aladdin: Abu, can you stop him?

[yell]

Aladdin: Abu, what's mad about you? There’s a magic carpet. Come on. Get out of here. We don't want to hurt you.

[yell]

Aladdin: Hey, don't worry too much, Abu. He doesn't want to bite. THANK YOU.

[screaming]

Aladdin: Hello. Wait a minute. Don't go to the gym. Maybe you can help. Hey! Wow! Look, we're trying to find this lamp. I think he knows where it is.

[sighs with delight].

[there are echoes].

Aladdin: [ whispers] Wait here.

Abu: [sighs] Oh!

Aladdin: That’s right. That’s why you came here… Abu! NOW!

Pit: Unbelievers!

Ash: Ohh.

Cave: You've touched unstoppable treasure! From now on, you will never see the light again!

Aladdin: Wow!

Abou: Help! Help! Help!

Aladdin: I got you! Wow. Mat, let’s go. Abu! Abu, it’s time to panic. Start panicking.

Both: Wow!

[Exhales breath].

[thunderous thunderstorms].

[roar].

Aladdin: Help me.

Old Jafar: Throw me the lamp.

Aladdin: I can't take it. Give me your hand.

Chief Jafa: Give me the lamp first. [maniacal laughter] Yeah! finally! [laugh]

Aladdin: [Aladdin struggles] What are you doing?

Old Jafar: I will give you your reward. [Old Jafar's voice returns to normal Jafar's] Eternal reward. [Abu then bites his hand, then screams].

[yell]

[screams of cave collapse].

Jafar: [laughs] Mine. [takes off his mask] It's all mine. Me... Where is he? Now… DON’T OOOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!!!!

Sultan: Jasmine? Oh dear brother. What’s the wrong thing?

Jasmine: [sniffs] Jafar... what the fuck.

Sultan: There, there, my dear. We’ll sort things out. Now tell me everything.

Abu: That's right. Aladdin is a brother. Develop. Aladdin is a brother.

Aladdin: Ah! My head is right. They were arrested. This two-faced jackal boy! Whoever it was, he’s long gone with the lamp.

Abu: Jesus!

Aladdin: [laughs] Well, you little brain thief. It looks like ugly, useless scrap metal.
Hi, I think it's written here, but it's hard to understand.

Genie: Wow! Hey! 10,000 years gives you such a stiff neck. Please wait a little longer. Wow! WOW!!! Is it safe to be outside?
I'm telling you, I'm glad to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hey. Where did you come from? What is your name?

Aladdin: Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

Genius: Aladdin. Greetings to Aladdin. It's great to have you on the show. Did I call you "Ali"? Or maybe just "Din". And "Laddie"?
They would say, "Here, boy. Come on, Laddie."
Aladdin: I nodded harder than I thought I would.

Genie: Do you smoke? Would you mind if I did? [laughs] Oh, sorry, Cheetah. I hope I didn't burn the edges. Oh, the Rugman guy. I haven’t seen you in a few thousand years.
Give me the pompom. If. Uh huh. Say you are inferior to my former master. Either that or I'm overweight. Look at a place.
Do I look different to you?

Aladdin: Wait a minute. Am I your master?

Genie: Absolutely. He may be studied. What do you want from me? Always surprising, long content, often imitated but never copied… [echo].
Duplicate, duplicate... Genius... Lamp! Here, right from the lamp, right here for your dearest wishes to be fulfilled. THANK YOU.

Aladdin: Well done. Do you want to be fulfilled?

Genie: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-no more to wish. Of course. Three. Uno, dos, and so on. Now change, change or restore.

Jafar: "Marry a princess..." Hmm... Interesting...

Sultan: What is it? WHO?

Sultan: Jasmine likes this.

Aladdin: And I already like princess Jasmine.

Jafar: Your highness, now. I have to mention Jasmine. This guy is no different. What makes her think she’s fit for a princess?

Aladdin: Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa. Let him meet me. I'll win your daughter.

Jasmine: How dare you. You guys are all right. Will I be left to decide the future? I am not going to win an award.

Sultan: Oh my dear. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Give Jasmine time to calm down.

Jafar: I think it’s time to say goodbye to Prince Abooboo.

Aladdin: [Aladdin screams] What am I supposed to do? Jasmine won't even let me talk to her. I should know that I cannot fulfill the wishes of these foolish princes.

[janwalt'a]

Genie: Go ahead. Hey. That’s a good idea. I don't believe it. I'm going all-in.

Aladdin: Genie, I need help.

Genie: Well, Sparky, here's the deal. If you want revenge on that little lady, you have to be a genius. Did you find that?

Aladdin: What?

Genie: Tell him the truth!

Aladdin: Not at all. If Jasmine knew I was really a dirty street rat, she would laugh at me.

Genius: A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh. Al, as an aside, you really need to behave yourself.

Aladdin: Hey, that's the last thing. Well, I’m going to see him. I... I have to be nice, cool, brave. How do you look like?

Genie: Like a prince.

[sighs] he said.

Aladdin: Princess Jasmine?

[janwalt'a]

Jasmine: Is there anyone there?

Aladdin: Nayawa, Prince Ali. Hmm. Oh, Prince Ali Ababwa, please.

Jasmine: I don’t want to see you.

Aladdin: No, no, please, princess. Give me a chance.

Figura: (T'ijtäwi) .

Jasmine: Leave me alone.

Aladdin: Oh, kitty.

Genie: How's your boyfriend?

Aladdin: Good cat, take it.

[Image by Murisee]

Aladdin: Oh, kitty.

Jasmine: Wait. Wait. Do I know you, guys?

Aladdin: Okay now. NOW.

Jasmine: You remind me of someone I met at the market.

Aladdin: The market? I have servants who market for me. Well, I even have servants who go to the market for my servants.
SO. It would not have been known to me.

Jasmine: No, I don’t think so.

Genie: You're welcome, Casanova. Let's talk about him. He's smart, funny, hair, eyes. No. Select a function.

Aladdin: Hmm. Princess Jasmine? You're still.

Genius: Great, wonderful, true.

Aladdin: ...of course.

Jasmine: On time?

Genie: Excuse me.

Aladdin: Uh, very nice.

Genie: Good treatment.

Jasmine: Hmm. I’m rich, you know.

Aladdin: Yes.

Jasmine: Daughter of the Sultan.

Aladdin: I know.

Jasmine: A great prize for any prince who marries.

Aladdin: That's true. ADEQUATE. A prince like me.

Genie: Be careful! Communication!

Jasmine: That's true. A prince like you. And every other stuffed shirt, cheeky peacock I know.

Genie: There's uru! Yanapa!

Jasmine: Go jump off the balcony!

Aladdin: What?

Genie: Stop him. Stop him, please! Would you like to push him?

Aladdin: Nothing happened.

Genie: Okay, fine. But remember the "bee" itself.

Aladdin: Yeah, that's true.

Jasmine: What about you?

Aladdin: Uh... Uh, you're right. [sighs] You don’t feel like a prize. You have the freedom to make your own choices. I'm going to go now.

Jasmine: Now!

Aladdin: What? Bitter?

Jasmine: Like... How do you do that?

Aladdin: The flying carpet.

Jasmine: That’s lovely.

[Carpet "jamp'att'asi" amparapa].

Aladdin: You, uh... You don't want a ride? We can see the world out of the palace.

Iago: We need to get out of here. We have to get out. I have to start packing your Highness. Only the most important things.
We need to slow down and bring guns, pistols, knives, and what do you think about this picture? I don't know, I think I'm making a weird face with it.

Genie: Of course you can. You just say, "Genius, I want to be free."

Aladdin: I'm sober! Look, I’m sorry. Really! But they wanted to make me the Sultan. No, they want to act like Prince Ali Sultan. Without you I am Aladdin.

Genie: Al, you win.

What if Jasmine found out? i'm losing it. Genius, I can’t do this alone. I don't want you to be free.

#I'll tell you everything
When I have time#
#Slowly slowly move forward

Here’s the existing one.
Move on from the #killers
One step ahead of pack# .
#I want to go for a walk

- Stand up, thief.
- Vandals are responsible.
- ¡Abu!
- More scandal.

Curry.
Hold onto that!
He has a sword!
You guys are idiots.
We all have swords.

- Damn you rat!

- Deceiver!

Surti guardian! Chhuy!
And now, my dear effendi, we are happy.
Light.
We’re going to be us!
Oh no, I don't.
Here. Jack. You have to take it.
Oh no, I don't. Or is it a ?
On the way to the palace, I think.
Another suitor for the princess.
- Get out of my way, brats.
Chhuy!
If I were as rich as you are
I indulged in certain habits.
I see. I will teach you to walk.
Look, Abu.
You don’t see that every day
a horse with two hind ends.
Animal!
You're a worthless street rat.
You were born a street rat, .
you died like a street rat
and only fleas cry for you.
I don't value anything.
And I don’t have fleas.
Come on, Abu.
Let’s go home.
#Riffraff, caturotta#.
#i didn't buy this#
#They can watch more closely#
#could they take care of that poor guy#
#Not my father#
#They could have found out#
#There's more to come#
#For Me#
One day, Abu,
things change.
We are rich, we live in a palace,
and I have never had any problems.
I have never been so upset.
Oh Prince Ahmed .
You wouldn’t leave that early, would you?
Good luck marrying her.
Oh yeah, yeah! Jasmine was like that.
Jasmine is alright!
Jasmine is alright!
- Jasmine!
That's cool, Rajah.
That’s why Prince Ahmed did it
fighting
oh dad
Rajah continued to play with him.
Isn't that true, Rajah?
you are just kidding
and isthapt'ata
Self-conscious Prince Ahmed,
Isn't that right ?
Honey, don’t disagree
every suitor who comes calling.
The law says
you marry a prince…
before the next birthday.
The law is not good enough.
There are only three days left.
Sir, I hate to be forced to do that.
If I get married, .
I want it to be out of love.
Jasmine is the.
it is not this rule.
I won't be here forever,
suma i...
I want to know without a doubt
you will be taken care of.
Anticipated slowly.
Try to understand.
I never did anything on my own.
I never had any real friends.
Except you, Rajah.
I’ve never been there
outside the palace walls.
But Jasmine, you are a princess.
So maybe he doesn't want to
to be more of a princess.
Oooh! naya naya...
Allah has forbidden you to do so
must have daughters.
Mmm?
I don’t know where he got it.
His mother was not such a choice.
I see! Ah, Jafar .
My most trusted adviser.
I want your knowledge.
Life is meant to serve you, sir.
It’s the business of suitors.
Jasmine refused
choose your husband.
- I'm at the end of my nerves.
- Oh, they were! Finish the rope!
I see!
A biscuit, good Polly.
His majesty is real
think with gentle animals.
NOW,
maybe i can figure out the solution
this difficult problem.
If anyone can help, you will.
However, this may require some management
the mystic blue diamond .
I see. Oh my ring?
But it has been in the family for many years.
We need to find out
the princess is a suitor.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.
Diamond was the name.
Here, in Jafar.
Everything you need is well equipped.
You are very kind, sir.
Now run and play
with your little toys, isn't it?
If. It’s going to be pretty cool.
Can't take it anymore !
I would have to choke once more
those moldy, disgusting cookies…
Boom! I'm fighting!
Relax, Lake.
Then I held his head.
I'm fighting!
Soon I will be the Sultan,
not this stupid idiot.
And then stuffed with cookies
it was crazy.
¡Haha!
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.
But I can’t stay here
and my life must be lived for me.
I will miss you.
Animal Animal.
Good morning, Abu. Go.
Try it out. The sewing machines
dances, songs.
In this case, remove your foot.
Why do you.
To get out of here, .
you damn dirty monkey!
Animal Animal.
They also look at things.
Breakfast will be served.
Good woman, buy a pot.
There could be no finer dish made of brass or silver.
Sugar cubes .
Sweet dates and figs.
Sweet dates and pistachios.
Does a woman need a necklace?
A beautiful necklace for a beautiful woman.
Fresh challwa!
We caught them, you bought them!
Oh no, I don't. I don't believe it.
I see!
P'ampachawi.
I’m really, really sorry.
Wow.
Oh no, I don't.
Ask everyone. How do I live?
Oh, you must be hungry.
Here’s the existing one.
You better pay for it .
Is he the only one?
No one steals the basket.
Oh, I’m sorry, sir.
I don't have the money.
- The powers!
- Amp sum.
If you let me go to the palace,
I can find the Sultan.
you know what
is there a penalty for stealing?
No! I’m not thankful!
Thank you, sir.
I am so glad you found it.
I'm looking for you everywhere.
- Art lurtä?
- Play a game.
Do you know this girl?
But unfortunately, yes. She’s my sister.
He's a little crazy.
He said he knew the Sultan.
He thinks the monkey is Sultan.
O wise Sultan, how can I serve you?
Sad, isn't it?
But there is no problem.
Now come on, sister.
It’s time to go to the doctor.
Good morning, Doctor.
How is this going to happen?
- No, I don't know. Don’t be afraid.
"Come on, Sultan.
Eh. Kuna?
Come back here, little thieves!
With all due respect,
Your decay, .
we can’t just wait
for the right wind?
Breathe save me, Lake. More immediately.
Yes, this is my father's prayer.
No, the weather is slow.
Show it to me
whoever enters the hole.
Jesus! Jesus!
Here’s the existing one.
My diamond is hard.
He is. It’s called a clown
Did they wait for it?
Let the guards get on with it
an invitation to the palace, okay?
Swell.
Almost as much.
I want to thank you guys
for the arrest of this man.
Forget about it.
So this is your first time
market, right?
Is it that obvious?
Well, you're still famous.
I mean, as if you didn’t know
how Agrabah can fail .
Hmmm, I'm a bit of a student.
Wow.
Chuy.
Come on. Such.
Wow. Keep your head in there .
Be careful.
Do you live here?
If. I'm with Abumpiki.
Come, go as you please.
It looks amazing.
Well, not so much, .
but it has a broad vision.
Wow. The palace is overlooked
Interesting, isn’t it?
Oh, that’s funny.
I wondered what it would be like
it’s like I lived there
and there are slaves and servants.
Oh, of course. People are reporting
where to go, how to dress.
Much better than this.
You're always looking for food
and dodging guards.
You are not free
you have to choose for yourself.
- Sometimes it's.
- You're just.
...ansa.
So where did you come from?
What is the value of this?
I was running away
and I'm not going back.
Really. How can it be so?
Why do you.
My father inspires me
marriage.
It’s… terrible.
¡Abu!
Is there?
Abu says that.
it is not accurate.
Is there?
- Is that right?
- Of course.
Ja Abu
do you have anything else to say?
So he wants to be
what he could do to help.
Oh no, I don't.
Mmm.
Call him the best.
That's where you are.
"They're following me!" You?
- My father sent them to.
"Can you trust me?"
- Is there?
"Can you trust me?"
- Joo...
So jump in!
Keep crossing paths, .
Aren’t you, street rat?
Run! Go! Get out of here!
Take this thing away from me!
- This is a prison for you, son.
- I'm going to leave.
Let him go.
- Look here, guys. Street snow.
Therefore,
at the command of the princess.
Princess Jasmine.
- Nice?
- Nice?
What are you doing outside the palace?
And this street rat.
It is not your problem.
Just do as I say. Let him go, please.
i will princesa
or my orders from Jafar.
- You need to talk to him.
- Believe me, I'm sorry.
Jafar is the one?
Oh princess.
So it’s a good idea! Jafar, I'm stuck.
How can I help you out?
The guards took only the boy
it's in order .
Your father condemned me
Peace in Agrabah.
- The guy is a bad guy.
- What's his fault?
You can’t breathe, Jafar.
Why kidnap the princess,
Of course.
You're.
Ah! That is annoying!
He was not kidnapped.
I was running away.
Ohhh.
Oh, how wonderful.
I'd know...
What do you mean?
Oh, the boy’s judgment
it is almost complete.
What is the aruchjasa?
Soul.
- With the fight.
- No.
I am so sorry, princess.
How are you?
So how did that happen?
I think he took it well.
It's all my fault, Rajah.
- I don't even know his name.
She was a princess.
I don't believe it.
I must have watched it
so foolish for him.
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin is great!
Ask everyone!
Ashes. Akana.
Come on, help us out of here.
Hey, he was in trouble.
Ah, he’s good enough.
Jïsa jïsa jïsa
Don't worry.
I will never see him again.
I’m a street rat, remember?
And there is a rule.
She must marry the prince.
- She deserves a prince.
- Yes Yes!
I'm a slow mover.
You’re just a fool
you leave me alone baby
Who are you?
A humble prisoner like you.
But together,
perhaps more than that.
I'm listening to you.
There's a hole, baby, .
the cave of wonders, .
full of treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.
Animal!
A treasure, it is fascinating
your princess i bet.
Jafar, what a surprise?
I’m dying for it.
But the rule is that only a prince.
You have heard the golden rule,
Isn't that right ?
Whoever has the gold
makes rules.
Why are you telling me all this
dear treasure with me?
I have a young pair of legs and.
strong behind to pursue him.
It's a problem.
There's a guy.
We’re here to stay.
Um. Things aren’t always like this
how they appear.
SO...
we have a contract
Oh, I don't know.
Who disturbs sleep?
That’s me, Aladdin.
Sarayaña.
Do not touch anything other than the lamp.
remember my son
first bring me the lamp
and then you need to do that
get your reward.
Come on, Abu.
You can look at that!
These are just a few
To make me richer than the Sultan.
¡Abu!
Don't... touch... anything.
We need to find the lamp.
¿Eh?
- Aladdin!
- Abu, can you stop him?
Abu what are you crazy about?
There’s a magic carpet.
Come on. Get out of here.
We don't want to hurt you.
Hey, don't worry too much, Abu.
He doesn't want to bite.
PAY SUPER.
Wait a minute. Don't go to the gym.
Maybe you can help.
Chhuy! Wow!
You see, we tried
to find this lamp.
I think he knows where it is.
Wait here .
I see!
So what is it?
That's what we came for
everything here is…
Abu! They!
- The unbelievers!
- Oh no, I don't.
You've touched it
forbidden treasure!
Now you will never do it again
watch out for the day!
Wow!
Car! Car! Car!
I’ve got you guys!
Mat, let’s go.
¡Abu!
Abu, now is not the time to panic.
Start panicking.
Wow!
- Help me out.
- Throw me a lamp.
I couldn't take it.
Give me your hand.
Give me the lamp first.
¡Joo!
finally!
Art lurtä?
We give you your reward.
Your eternal reward.
That’s what I have.
Everything is mine.
I... where is he?
No.
No!
Is it Jasmine?
Oh dear brother.
What’s the wrong thing?
Jafar is a city.
he had done something wrong.
There, there, my love.
We’ll sort things out.
Now tell me everything.
I see.
Aladdin is a brother. Develop.
Aladdin is a brother.
I see! My head is right.
They were arrested.
This two-faced jackal boy!
to know who he is
he's been away with the lamp for a long time.
¡Ah!
Well, you hairy little thief.
It looks like a beating, .
worthless garbage.
Hi, I think so
what's written here
but it is difficult to understand.
¡Aaaaaaahhhhh!
Chhuy!
, years will give you
such a stubborn heart.
Please wait a little longer.
Wow! Wow!
Is that a worthwhile one?
you have to get out of it.
It's a pleasure to be back,
Brothers and sisters.
Hey. Where did you come from?
What is your name?
Er... Er, Aladdin.
Aladdin is a brother. Greetings to Aladdin.
It's great to have you on the show.
Did I call you "Ali"?
Or maybe just "Din".
Ja "Laddie" ukax?
They would say, "Here, boy. Come on, Laddie."
I was scratching my head
harder than I thought.
Do you smoke cigarettes? Would you mind if I did?
Please, Cheetah.
I hope I didn't burn the edges.
Oh, the Rugman guy. I don't think I've seen you
in a few thousand years.
Give me the pompom.
Yoo. Eh eh.
You should say it's lower
as the last master.
Or maybe even bigger.
Look at a place. Do I look different?
Wait a minute.
Am I your master?
Adequate. He may be studied.
What do you want from me?
It’s always amazing, .
jaya pacha content, .

Copy, duplicate...

A couple of three.
There is no change, .

Now I know I was dreaming.
Master, I don’t really understand

So why is he not thinking

Oh, almost like that.
A few reservations are required, .
certain contributions.
Justana?
Ah, the first rule of thumb:
I can’t kill anyone.
So don't ask me.
The second number rule.
You can’t do it for anyone
falling in love with another person.
You've got a small punishment.
Three number rule. I couldn't bring myself
people come back from the dead.
It’s not a good picture.
I just don't like that.
Otherwise, there you have it.
- Mmm.
- I see!
Reservations required?
You mean borders?
according to their desires?
Almighty genius.
I can’t even bring people
will return from the dead.
I don't know, Abu. Maybe it’s the same
I can't even get out of this hole.
That’s how we have to do it
find a way to do it.
P'ampachawi?
Are you looking at me?
Are you kicking my lamp?
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?
And you cheated on me?
I don't believe it,
it's not immediate.
You will get what you want,
so sit down!
- In a crisis, .
exits here, here, .
here, here, somewhere.
Holding hands and arms
under the carpet.
You're.
get out of here!
Jafar, that’s a scandal.
If it hadn't been all your years
good and honest service...
We need to talk from now on
to judge my prisoners,
before their heads were cut off.
I tell you, Your Highness,
it will never happen again.
Jasmine is the.
Jafar is a great city. Let's put everything
difficulties are behind it.
Amp sum.
My apologies and most humble apologies
you too, princess.
Something good will come
and that I was obliged to marry.
When you are queen, you feel
hard to get away from you.
It’s a nice sight.
So everything came together.
Now Jasmine, back to that
this suitor is…Jasmine?
Jasmine is alright!
I wish I had this lamp.
“I have the power
turn away from you. »
For example
jamp'att'asiskakiñasawa
to this idiot
and his foolish daughter
- in our lives.
- No, Lake.
He’s until he finds it
loqhe chacha
Then they brought us a banana.
Or they were beaten.
Wow!
I see. Wait a minute.
Jafar is a great city. And if you are
idiot husband?
Is there?
Okay, you got married
princess, are you okay?
And then you
to become the sultan.
I see.
A mosquito wedding.
I will be the Sultan.
- The idea is meritorious.
- Yes, it's necessary. If.
And then we let the stepfather down
and the little woman at the cliff.
¡Joo !
Christmas plate!
I like the road
your dirty little mind is at work.
Thank you for choosing the Magic Carpet
for everything that wants to go.
Do not stand near the mat
it's completely standing still.
PAY SUPER.
Now, greetings. Well yes.
PAY SUPER.
Well, how about this,
M. Are you waiting for Mustafa?
Oh, you showed me that well.
Now for my three wishes.
Are my ears bothering me?
Three. You're a point behind, kid.
Oh no, I don't. I never really expected it
to exit the cave.
You’re the only one who’s done it.
Well, I'm stupid.
All right you baaad boy
but no more gifts.
The right trade.
Three wishes, by the way.
I want them to be successful.
What do you want to do?
NAYA?
No one has ever asked me that before.
Well my point is…
Ah, forget about that.
- Is there?
- No, I don't. I...
Come on. Appointment.
Liwirtara.
Are you a prisoner?
All of these are important
the whole genius concert happened.
Phenomenal Cosmic Powers.
Very small living area.
Genius, this is terrible.
But oh, for freedom.
You don’t have to go there
"Huh huh. What do you want?"
Poof the rest . What do you need to do?
Poof the rest . What do you want to do?
To be my own master.
It would be like that
beyond all magic
and all the equipment
All over the world.
But what are you talking about?
Let’s get real here.
IT IS NOT THAT.
Genius, wake up and smell the hummus.
Why not?
The only way out
if my master wants to go.
So you can imagine how many times
it happened.
I'll do it, too. I will save you.
- Uh-huh, that's right.
- Not really, I promise.
after my first two wishes,
I use my third wish
to save you from the snow.
Well, I'm hoping so.
Light.
Let’s do some magic.
So what is the value?
What do you want more of?
Well, this girl exists.
Curry.
You can’t do it for anyone
falling in love, remember?
But, genius, .
he's smart and funny and.
- Nice?
- Nice.
He has these eyes that.
and the skin . Wow.
And his smile…
I'm going to be like that.
It’s lovely.
But she’s a princess.
And to give us a chance, .
I have to be like that.
Hey, can you make me a prince?
Let’s see here.
Royal chicken? No.
Alaskan king crab.
There's a little bit of it. I hate it when they do that.
Caesar salad is the best. Ah!
And you, Brute. No.
Haha. "Make a prince."
Is this an officer’s wish?
Say the magic words.
Genius, I need you
make me a prince
Light!
¡Eh heh! Mark! Mark!
First, this Fez and jacket combination
it is seriously of the third century.
These adjustments.
What do you mean, beggar?
No, work with me here.
So it's a good thing. I like this one very much. Very macho.
Now we need something else.
What does that tell me?
It’s about the means of transportation.
Sorry, jisk'a mono.
Whom. Such.
- Oh no, I don't.
- Well, this is him.
What better way to do it yourself
into the streets of Agrabah
like riding alone
a new camel.
Hear. They’re dancing.
Mmmm. It's not necessary.
Wali ch'amawa.
Wait and see.
What do you need to do?
¡Joo!
Esalalumbo Shimin Dumbo .
Wow!
Talk about your trunk.
Check this process.
Abu, you look beautiful.
He’s wearing a dress.
He has an elephant.
But we are not finished yet.
Hold on to your turban, kid.
We will make you a star.
Sir i have found a solution
your daughter's problem.
Alright. Problem with your daughter.
Really?
Akanah.
“The princess doesn’t choose
the husband at a fixed time, .
so the Sultan must act
complain to him. »
But Jasmine hated it
all the suitors.
How could I choose
who does he hate?
Don't worry, sir.
There's more to it than that.
“in the event
we can't get a good prince."
Jerk.
"So the princess is getting married….
Hmm. Interesting.
Is there? WHICH?
Real Viewfinder .
Well, that would be… me.
But I thought the law said
it is the prince alone
can marry a princess.
I'm still learning...
Desperate times call
desperate measures, dad.
If. Desperate measures.
You will order it
princess marrying me
I ordered…
Nice...
load...
But you’re too old.
The Princess will marry me.
The princess is ready to be married…
- What. What is this?
Aka musicaxa.
Jafar, please come
and take a look at this .

Llijukiri.
It’s really impressive.
Juma Alteza, .
I’ve been to far away places
seek your daughter’s hand.
Prince Ali Ababwa .
Of course.
Nice to meet you.
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He’s happy too.
That’s a lot of fun.
- I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...
- Regiment.
Forget about it.
You can’t just roll here
uninvited and expected…
Allah, indeed it is
amazing device.
Develop.
I don’t think so…
Indeed, Your Majesty.
Act.
Sir, I must advise you not to do so.
Amukt'am, Jafar.
Learn to have some fun.
AIE AIE AIE .
Ahhh! Wow!
Where you say you are
where you come from
Oh, more and more
you traveled, I know.
- Try me out.
- Very carefully, Polly.
Hey, look at this.
Look at him with that stupid rug.
¡Ah!
¡Huh huh!
Get out of the way.
I’m coming to the city.
Jafar, look at this.
- Impressive, Juma Highness.
- It's awesome.
Yes, it feels that way to me
have talent for it.
This guy is awesome.
And a prince for that matter.
If we are lucky, you won't
Eventually, I would marry Jasmine.
- I don't trust him, sir.
- That's incomprehensible.
I am proud of one thing, Jafar,
I’m a pretty good judge of character.
Oh, wali supreme judge.
Of course. No!
Jasmine appreciates that.
And I already know
I want Princess Jasmine.
Your Highness, no.
I have to mention Jasmine.
This guy is no different
some.
That's what makes him think
Is she fit for a princess?
Juma Alteza, .
I am Prince Ali Ababwa.
Let him meet me.
I'll win your daughter.
How dare you.
You guys are all right. Standing up
plan the future?
I am not going to win an award.
Ohhh.
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Give Jasmine time
my phisir.
I think it’s time to say goodbye
to Prince Abouboo .
What do I do with my own?
Jasmine doesn't do that
I want to talk to him.
I should know that I can’t escape this
this foolish prince wants it.
So you have to move somewhere else.
Chuy.
That’s a good idea.
I don't believe it.
I'm going all-in.
Genius, I need help.
All right, Sparky, .
this is a decision.
If you want to go to court
jisk'a lady,
you must be like that
fighting in the right direction.
- Did you get it?
- Is there?
Tell him…
-...come out!
- You are welcome.
If only Jasmine knew that I was really into it
dirty street rat, .
he’s laughing at me.
A woman values ​​a man
who makes him laugh.
Al, jokingly aside, .
you really have to behave yourself.
Hey, that’s the last thing I want.
Well, I’m going to see him.
I'm just... stupid,
cold, fearless.
How do you look like?
Like a prince.
Princess Jasmine?
- Who's here?
- I am, Prince Ali.
Hmm. Oh, Prince Ali Ababwa, please.
I don’t want to see you.
No, no, please, princess.
Give me a chance.

- In the world, cat.
How is our little friend doing?
Good cat, take it out.
Oh, kitty.
Wait. Wait.
Do I know you, guys?
No. No.
You remind me of something
I met him in the city.
Commercial?
My servants are going
to the market for me.
So we have visiting servants
the market of the animal.
You haven’t met me.
No, I don't think so.
Please, Casanova.
Let's talk about him.

But remember the "bee" itself.

Why do you.
Make sure it never gets discovered.
Never make a mistake. Take a bath
there's a problem with the lamp.
How do I live? Al?
Al! Baby, leave it alone.
You can’t fake this.
I can't help you if you don't want to.
You have to say, “Genius,
I want you to save my life.” Do you understand?
Come on, Aladdin!
I'll take it.
Superior reaching.
Don’t be so scared.
Genius, I am.
NAYA...
- Yuspajarapxsmawa, Genie.
- Jumax Al.
I’m starting to like you, boy.
I don't want to choose
curtains or something.
Jasmine was like that.
Oh lord, I just felt it
the most wonderful world .
- I'm still excited.
- You should be, Jasmine.
I have chosen a man for you.
- Is there?
- You married Jafar.
You are speechless, I see.
A great quality in a woman.
I will never marry you.
- Sir, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali is gone.
It's better to check yours
another crystal ball, Jafar.
Prince Ali it is!
How about... um. So it’s a good idea!
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You want to kill me.
What? Ridiculous nonsense, .
Your Highness is very much appreciated.
He's clearly lying.
It's obviously a lie.
Dad, what’s wrong with you?
I know something is wrong.
Oh, it’s not!
Jafar controls you with it.
What? Jafar is the one?
You are a traitor!
Juma Alteza, .
all of which can be explained.
¡Guardanaka! ¡Guardanaka!
Well, that’s it.
They were already dead. Forget about it.
Just dig a grave for them both.
They were already dead.
Jafar's quick finish.
Not done yet, baby.
Here it is!
- Search everywhere!
-Jasmine, are you alright?
Joo.
Jafar, my trusted adviser,
all the while plotting against me.
It’s horrible, just horrible.
How could I ever.
¿Eh?
Could that be true?
My daughter is later
have you chosen a suitor?
Ha, ha! Praise be to Allah!
You are a very smart young man, .
I can kiss you.
I'm not going to do that.
I've got that in my.
But you got married at the same time.
Yes Yes. And you’ll be happy
and prosperity, .
and you, my son, .

A handsome, honest young man
like you,

That’s exactly what this kingdom needs.
We need to get out of here.
Gotta start packing.
Only the most important things.
We've got to slow down.
Bring the guns, bring the guns, .
and what do you think of this picture?
I think I can make a weird face with it.
Oh no, I don't. It's broken.
He was going crazy.
¡Jar marka! ¡Jar marka!
Wait!
Excellent adhesion.
Prince Ali has none
the lazy boy Aladdin .
- He's got a lamp, Lake.
- Well, this poor.
But you guys will do that
to release him.
NAYA?
Is it the Sultan?
Do they want me to be their sultan?
¡Huzah!
#Hail to the Conquering Hero#
Aladdin, you just won
princess heart
What will you do next?
Psst Your line, .
"I want to give up life."
Whenever.
- Genius. I'm not going to be able to.
- Of course you do.
Let us go ahead,
"Genius, I want freedom."
I’m serious about it.
Look, I’m sorry. I’m definitely.
But they wanted to make me the Sultan.
No, they want to do it
Prince Ali Sultan .
Without you,
I’m just Aladdin.
- Al, you win.
- Friday.
The only reason we can think of
I’m worth everything, because of you.
And if they knew that
Am I really a prince?
What if Jasmine found out?
i'm losing it.
Genius, I can’t do that
keep it myself.
I don't want you to be free.
OK. I understand.
You lied to everyone.
Hey, I’m starting to feel left out.
I apologize now, Master.
Genius, I’m so sorry.
OK.
So hang in there.
What are you looking at?
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.
Abu, I’m sorry. I don't know.

I'm coming to you.
Got a problem, Pinky?
Jerk.
Boy, Jafar is happy to see you.
- Great job, Lake.
- Let's go.
It’s not really a coincidence. It’s on the scale
from one to ten, you are eleven.
Oh Jafar, you are so kind.
I'm shy.
I'm shaking yellow .
The people of Agrabah,
my daughter finally
chose a suitor.
Jasmine was like that.
Ali, where did you go?
Jasmine, there’s something
I have to tell you.
The whole kingdom returns

No, but Jasmine, listen to me.

I don't think you know him.
Ali's role tonight

and a horrible villain.
- Now it's your master.
- That's what I was afraid of.
Genie, grant me my first wish.
I want to reign supreme like a sultan.
- Wow!
- Blessed Almaxa.
What is this?
What’s going on?
Oh god, what's going on?
Father.

For you, the Vile Traitor Sultan.
Indeed?
We’ll see then.
A lampshade.
Visitor Keepers, Abooboo.
Genius, right!
Sorry, baby.
Now I have a new master.
Jafar, I'm telling you to stop.
Ah, but now there is a new order.
Nayan ordenaja.
Finally you bowed to me.
We will never bow down to you.
Why wasn’t I surprised?
If you do not bow to the Sultan,
and you knelt down
in front of the witch!
Genius, my second wish…
I want to be a stronger witch
in the world!
Genius, don’t give up!
Brothers, sisters,

Hey, that’s just it
perpetual bondage.
It’s lovely.
Al, you won’t find another girl

And the heat is very hot

Se and barbarian, mutta hei, se and kotini

And the sun comes from the west ukat juk'ampinaka

And the sand in the glass is right

I've never seen it

It's still a popular one
Tupperware from the Dead Sea .

Hear. Ah, it's beautiful.

Wait. Don't go to the gym.

I see you’re just interested
and exceptionally rarely .

I guess you can do that then
they will be more rewarded for thinking about it.

Don’t be fooled
because of its banal appearance.

Like many things, .
it’s not what’s out there

but what is important in our hearts.

This is no ordinary lamp.

Once that changes
of the life of a young man.

A young man like this lamp,
it was more than that.

A diamond is rough.

It begins in the darkest night,

where darkness awaits

with a dark lens .

(HORSE NICKERS) 1.1.

You're left behind.

A thousand forgivenesses, O patience.

So you have that?

I had to cut a couple of throats, but I did it.

Ah-ah-ahhh .

¡AH!

Trust me I'm spicy my friend.

JAFAR: Finally,
after all the years of research,

Cave of Wonders .

Alright. Cave of Wonders .

In the name of Allah .

Now let’s remember. Bring me the lamp.

The rest of the treasure is yours,
but the lamp is mine.

(NAURU) and more.

Oh, the lamp. Oh, the lamp.

Damn, where did you get this bastard?

Shh

(echo of thunder)

- Who's disturbing the bed?
(LUNTHAX smiles)

I, Gazeem, a humble thief.

Let them know.

If you come here,

whose value is far away.

A diamond is rough.

What are you waiting for? Jack.

(The animal shouted)

-(ROAR) smirking.
(yell)

No!

(what happened)

I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

We will never do that
remove that stupid lamp.

Forget about it. Let's take a look at it.
I was furious, so I tolerated it.

Paciencianïña, Iago. Llamp'ucha.

Gazeem was like that
slightly less.

Oh, there's a big surprise.

I think I have a heart attack
and that strange death.

What are we going to do?
We have a big problem here, a big…

Joo.

Only one can enter.

I need to find this, this.

A diamond is rough.

MAN: Don't stop! Thief!

I will take the trophy from your hand,
street snowflakes

All this for bread?

Wow!

(YELL)

- VALTIJA: There he is!
- You won't get through this so easily!

Did you think it was easy?

(NAURA) and others.

You two are right there

- We'll find him.
- Animal sisters.

We got into trouble a little bit earlier
today, right, Aladdin?

- I'm getting you.
- I'm having problems.

And this time…

( MONO SQUENQNG

Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

- Abu.
- Come on. Let’s get out of here.

(SCREAMING) I have to jump
In front of the bread line

One step ahead of the sword

I just stole what I couldn't afford

That’s the whole thing

A leap forward from law enforcement

It is, and it is no joke

A little snack, guys

and the stirring
Bring it back guys

I can take a hint
I have to face the facts

- You are my only friend, Abu
- WOMAN: Who?

Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom

He becomes a bachelor, he increases the evil

I blamed the parents
Except he doesn’t have it

I have to eat to survive
I have to steal to eat

I will tell you everything
When I had the time

Slow down and slow down and jump forward
Stepping forward from my loss

Next time I will use a pen name

Here’s the existing one

A leap forward hitters
One step ahead of the pack

I think I want to go for a walk

Scandal is a great example

Let us not be too quick

I think it’s pretty good.

I have to eat to survive
I have to steal to eat

Otherwise, we had a good time

Leader: Get him!

He has a sword!

You guys are idiots. We all have swords.

They're fast, but I'm faster

Come, I'd better put my hand on it

I wish you a safe landing
AH what you have to do is jump

(YELL)

GUARDS: Happy! Hey!

ABU: ¡Nam, nam!

Oh no, I don't.

(SIGH)

Here. Jack. You have to take it.

(NAURA) and others.

(LAUGHTER)

Oh no, I don't. Or is it a ?

On the way to the palace, I think.

Another suitor for the princess.

(K'AJA)
(FEMALE FIBER) .

-(HIGH) 1.1.
- Get out of my way, brats.

Chhuy!

If I were as rich as you are
I indulged in certain habits.

I see. I will teach you to walk.

(MEN ALSO)

(GRIMATION) 1.1.

Look, Abu.

You don’t see that every day
a horse with two hind ends.

PEOPLE: Wow!

You're a worthless street rat.

You were born a street rat, .
you died like a street rat

and only fleas cry for you.

I don't value anything.

And I don’t have fleas.

(SCREAM) Riffraff, street snow

I would not buy this

If only they had looked more closely

Did they see the poor boy?

No, sir

They could have found it

And there are many more

For me, it’s

(Sighs) One day, Abu, .
things change.

We are rich, we live in a palace,

and I have never had any problems.

(GALLO ALSO)

I have never been so upset.

Oh Prince Ahmed .
You wouldn’t leave that early, would you?

Good luck marrying her.

Oh yeah, yeah! Jasmine was like that.

Jasmine is alright!

Jasmine is alright!

- Jasmine!
-(SLAVE)

That's cool, Rajah.

So that's why
Prince Ahmed rushed out.

oh dad

Rajah continued to play with him.
Isn't that true, Rajah?

you are just kidding
and isthapt'ata

Self-conscious Prince Ahmed,
Isn't that right ?

(ALL LARUNA)

(FOURTH VERIFICATION)

Honey, don’t disagree
every suitor who comes calling.

The law says
marry a prince

before the next birthday.

The law is not good enough.

There are only three days left.

Sir, I hate to be forced to do that.

When I get married, I want it to be a marriage of love.

jasmina, 1999 marana.

it is not this rule.

I won't be here forever,
suma i...

I want to know without a doubt
you will be taken care of.

Anticipated slowly.

Try to understand.

I never did anything on my own.
I never had any real friends.

(GRUNTS) screaming.

Except you, Rajah.

I didn’t go outside either
the walls of the palace.

But Jasmine, you are a princess.

So maybe he doesn't want to
to be more of a princess.

Oooh! NAYA...

Allah has forbidden you to do so
must have daughters.

Mmm?

I don’t know where he got it.

His mother was not such a choice.

I see! Ah, Jafar .

My most trusted adviser.

Life is meant to serve you, sir.

- I'm at the end of my nerves.
- Oh, they were! Finish the rope!

(LAUGHTER) it's going to happen!

- Take a biscuit, good Polly.
(JAFAR LAUGH) .

His majesty is real
think with gentle animals.

(GRUNTS) screaming.

NOW,
maybe i can figure out the solution

this difficult problem.

If anyone can help, you will.

However, this may require some management
the mystic blue diamond .

Oh, my ring?

But it has been in the family for many years.

We need to find out
the princess is a suitor.

Don't worry.

Everything will be fine.

Everything will be fine.

Diamond was the name.

Here, in Jafar.

Everything you need is well equipped.

You are very kind, sir.

Now run and play
with your little toys, isn't it?

If. It’s going to be pretty cool.

(Spit, vomiting) .

Can't take it anymore !

I would have to choke once more
those moldy, disgusting cookies…

Barn! Nuwaña!

Relax, Iago.

Then I held his head.
V ¡Hack!

Soon I will be the Sultan,
not this confused idiot.

And then stuffed with cookies
in the throat. Ha, ha!

(LAUGHTER)

Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

But I can’t stay here
and my life must be lived for me.

I will miss you.

(LAUGHTER)

Animal Animal.

(SITTING IN THE SELLER)

Good morning, Abu. Go.

Try it out. The sewing machines
dances, songs.

(sighs)

- Take it from the top.
-(RAITA) .

Why do you.

To get out of here, .
you damn dirty monkey!

Animal Animal.

- Suma lurt'ata, Abu.
-(KUJERRUS) .

Breakfast will be served.

Good woman, buy a pot.
There could be no finer dish made of brass or silver.

Sugar cubes . Sweet dates and figs.

Sweet dates and pistachios.

Does a woman need a necklace?

A beautiful necklace for a beautiful woman.

Fresh challwa!

We caught them, you bought them!

Oh no, I don't. I don't believe it.

-About
(STANDING)

- Forgiveness.
(GULPS) .

(röyhtäily) .

I’m really, really sorry.

Wow.

Oh no, I don't.

How do I live? How do I live?

Oh, you must be hungry.

Here’s the existing one.

You better pay for it .

- Is he the only one?
- No one stole the basket.

Oh, I’m sorry, sir.
I don't have the money.

- The powers!
- Amp sum.

If you let me go to the palace,
I can find the Sultan.

You know
what is the punishment for stealing?

No! I’m not thankful!

Thank you, sir.
I am so glad you found it.

I'm looking for you everywhere.

- Art lurtä?
- Play a game.

Do you know this girl?

But unfortunately, yes. She’s my sister.

He's a little crazy.

He said he knew the Sultan.

He thinks the monkey is Sultan.

O wise Sultan, how can I serve you?

(SIHAA) .

Sad, isn't it?

But there is no problem.

Now come on, sister.
It’s time to go to the doctor.

Good morning, Doctor. How is this going to happen?

No, no, no, no. Don’t be afraid.
Come on, Sultan.

(GIBERATION) .

(AMTAYAATANAKA)

Or is it a ? What?

Come back here, little thieves!

(EXPLOSION) .

can we just wait for a real storm?

Hold your breath, Iago. More immediately.

Yes, my friend is with me.

(AMTAYAATANAKA)

No, the weather is slow.

Show it to me
whoever enters the hole.

Jesus! Jesus!

Here’s the existing one.

My diamond is hard.

Is it himself? It’s called a clown
Did they wait for it?

Let the guards get on with it
an invitation to the palace, okay?

Swell.

(CH'UXU)

(SUMA LARUNA) .

Almost as much.

I want to thank you guys
for the arrest of this man.

Forget about it.

So this is your first time
market, right?

Is it that obvious?

Well, you're still famous.

I mean, as if you didn’t know
how Agrabah can fail .

Hmmm, I'm a bit of a student.

Wow.

(LOUD) Hi.

Come on. Such.

Wow. Keep your head in there .

Be careful.

Do you live here?

If. I'm with Abumpiki.
Come, go as you please.

It looks amazing.

Well, not so much, .
but it has a broad vision.

Wow. The palace is overlooked
Interesting, isn’t it?

Oh, that’s funny.

I wondered what it would be like
it’s like I lived there

and there are slaves and servants.

Oh, of course. People are reporting
where to go, how to dress.

Much better than this.

You're always looking for food
and dodging guards.

You are not free
you have to do something for yourself.

- Sometimes it's.
- You're just.

- Ansa.
- Ansa.

(FOURTH VERIFICATION)
So where did you come from?

What is the value of this?

I ran away and didn't come back.

- Really? How can it be so?
- Why are you.

My father forced me to get married.

It’s… Terrible.

- ALADDINI Jan Wali!
(HATEFUL POSITION)

Is there?

Abu says it’s not fair.

Is there?

- Is that right?
- Of course.

Ja Abu
do you have anything else to say?

So he wants to be
what he could do to help.

Oh no, I don't.

Mmm.

Call him the best.

That's where you are.

"They're following me!"
- Are they after you?

My father must have sent them…

"Can you trust me?"
- Is there?

"Can you trust me?"
- Joo...

So jump in!

Keep crossing paths, .
Aren’t you, street rat?

Run! Go! Get out of here!

Take this thing away from me!

- This is a prison for you, son.
- I'm going to leave.

Let him go.

- Look here, guys. Street snow.
(GUARDS Laugh)

He must go at the princess’s command.

Princess Jasmine.

- Nice?
-ABU: Princess?

It is not your problem.
Just do as I say. Let him go, please.

i will princesa
or my orders from Jafar.

- You need to talk to him.
- Believe me, I'm sorry.

Am I too far away?

Oh princess.

So it’s a good idea! Jafar, I'm stuck.

How can I help you out?

The guards took only the boy
it's in order .

Your father condemned me
Peace in Agrabah.

- The guy is a bad guy.
- What's his fault?

You can’t breathe, Jafar.

Why kidnap the princess,
Of course.

You just... Aah! That is annoying!

He was not kidnapped. I was running away.

Ohhh.

Oh, how wonderful.
I'd know...

What do you mean?

Oh, the boy’s judgment
it is almost complete.

What is the aruchjasa?

- Soul.
-(EXPERIENCE)

- With the fight.
- No.

I am so sorry, princess.

How are you?

(JACHA)

(what happened)

(AMTAYAATANAKA)

So how did that happen?

I think he took it well.

(JASMINE smiles)

It's all my fault, Rajah.

- I don't even know his name.
(RAJAH'S STORIES)

I must have looked silly to him.

ABUI Y00-h00! Aladdin is great! Good morning!

Ashes. Akana.

(sighs)

Come on, help us out of here.

(ABOUT)

Hey, he was in trouble.
Ah, he’s good enough.

Jïsa jïsa jïsa

Don't worry, Abu.
I will never see him again.

I’m a street rat, remember?
And there is a rule.

She must marry the prince.

- She deserves a prince.
- Yes Yes!

I'm a slow mover.

MAN: You're an idiot
you leave me alone baby

Who are you?

A humble prisoner like you.

I'm listening to you.

There's a hole, baby, .
the cave of wonders, .

full of treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

Animal!

The treasure is fascinating
princesses too, I suppose.

Jaiyar, ?jank'akismati?
I’m the gym, I’m here.

-(Invitation)
- But the law says that the prince alone.

You have heard the golden rule,
Isn't that right ?

(slow laughter)

Why are you telling me all this
dear treasure with me?

I want a young pair of legs
and a strong back to continue it .

It's a problem.

There's a guy. We’re here to stay.

Um. Things aren’t always like this
how they appear.

So do we have a deal?

Oh, I don't know.

(THUNDER CRASH) .

Who disturbs sleep?

That’s me, Aladdin.

Do not touch anything other than the lamp.

And then you get rewarded.

You little pony right there.

Three number rule. I couldn't bring myself
people come back from the dead.

It’s not a good picture.
I just don't like that.

Otherwise, there you have it.

- Mmm.
- I see!

Reservations required? You mean borders?

according to their desires? Almighty genius.

I can’t even bring people
will return from the dead.

I don't know, Abu. Maybe it’s the same
I can't even get out of this hole.

That’s how we have to do it
find a way out of here.

P'ampachawi?

Are you looking at me?
Are you kicking my lamp?

Did you wake me up?

I tell you, Your Highness,
it will never happen again.

Jasmine is the.

Jafar is a great city. Let's put everything
difficulties are behind it.

Something good will come
and that I was obliged to marry.

When I was the Queen
I have the power to turn away from you.

Here right now. It’s a nice sight.
So everything came together.

Now, Jasmine, I'm back

Jasmine is alright!

Keep kissing, for example

I see. Wait a minute. Jafar is a great city.

Is there?

And then you become the Sultan.

I see.

A mosquito wedding.

I will be the Sultan.

- The idea is meritorious.

And then we let the stepfather down

Well, how about this,
M. Are you waiting for Mustafa?

Oh, you showed me that well.
Now for my three wishes.

Are my ears bothering me?

Three? You're a point behind, kid.

Oh no, I don't. I never really expected it
to exit the cave.

You’re the only one who’s done it.

Well, I'm stupid.

Okay you bad boy
but no more gifts.

The right trade. Three wishes, by the way.

I want them to be successful.

What do you want to do?

NAYA?

No one has ever asked me that before.

Well, for me... Ah, forget it.

- Is there?
- No, I don't. I...

Come on. Appointment.

Liwirtara.

Are you a prisoner?

All of these are important
the whole genius concert happened.

Phenomenal Cosmic Powers.

Very small living area.

Genius, this is terrible.

But oh, to be free…

You don’t have to go there
"Huh huh. What do you want?"

"Huh huh. What do you want?"
Poof the rest . What do you want to do?

To be my own master.

That would be even bigger
that’s all the magic

and all the treasures in the world.

But what are you talking about?

Let’s get real here.
IT IS NOT THAT.

Why not?

The only way out
if my master wants to go.

So you can imagine how many times
it happened.

I'll do it, too. I will save you.

- Uh-huh, that's right.
- Not really, I promise.

After making my first two wishes,

I will use my third will to save you.

Well, I'm hoping so. Light.

Let’s do some magic.

So what is the value?
What do you want more of?

Well, this girl exists.

You can’t do it for anyone

- Nice?
- Nice.

He has these eyes that.
And that hair. Wow.

And his smile... (SIGH) .

I'm going to be like that.

It’s lovely.

But she’s a princess.

Hey, can you make me a prince?

Let’s see here.

Is he the chicken king? No.

Alaskan king crab.
There's a little bit of it. I hate it when they do that.

Caesar salad is the best. Ah! And you, Brute? No.

Haha. "Make a prince."

Is this an officer’s wish?
Say the magic words.

Genius, I need you
make me a prince

Light!

¡Eh heh! Mark! Mark!

First, this Fez and jacket combination
it is seriously of the third century.

These adjustments.
What do you mean, beggar?

No, work with me here.

So it's a good thing. I like this one very much. Very macho.

Now we need something else.
What does that tell me?

It’s about the means of transportation.

Sorry, jisk'a mono.
Aqul' slightly less. Such.

“The princess doesn’t choose
the husband at a fixed time, .

"Then the Sultan will choose for him."

But Jasmine hated all the suitors.

How could I choose one
does he hate it?

Don't worry, sir. There's more to it than that.

“Nothing can happen
We can't find a better prince..."

Jerk.

"Then the princess should be married….

Hmm. Interesting.

Is there? WHICH?

Well that would be me.

I'm still learning...

Geniuses are more powerful

Is there?

He gives you your strength.
He has to take it.

Al, what are you doing?
Why have you brought me here?

Believe it, Jafar.
You’re still in second place.

You’re right about that.

His power is stronger than mine.

But it doesn't last long.

The guy is crazy.

So, I guess this is goodbye?

Oh this stupid slave. It’s not right.

Munsmawa.

(SNIFFS) That's fine.
I've got a little more need for you.

Sano inamaya sana
and you are a prince again.

Hey, it’s just perpetual slavery.

It’s lovely.

Al, you won’t find another girl
a million years older than him.

Believe me, I know. I'm looking at it.

Jasmine, I love you so much,

but I must stop pretending
to be something I am not.

I understand.

Genius, I want your freedom.

Get out
the prince's pedigree looms next.

- Genius, you're free.

I’m free to go. I’m free to go.

Oh, does it feel good! I see!

I am free! I was finally free!

I also liked Al. (SNIFFS) .

Maynix kunsi siskpan, I'm not sure what to do.

Adequate.

You have certainly proved your worth
because it comes to me.

This rule creates a problem .

- Father?
- Well, am I a sultan or a sultan?

From today onwards,

the princess is getting married
which he sees fit.

Him. I chose to…

I would choose you, Aladdin.

Please call me Al.

Oh everyone, come here.
Great group kissing.

Group hug .

Do you mind if I kiss a monkey?

Oh hairball .

So it can't get any worse
around this Popsicle.

I'm going to leave!

Well, you two crazy lovebirds!
