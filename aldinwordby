lt 
begins 
on 
a 
dark 
night. 
Where 
a 
dark 
man 
waits 
with 
a 
dark 
purpose. 
You 
are 
late. 
A 
thousand 
apologies, 
oh 
patient 
one. - 
You 
have 
it, 
then? 
- l 
had 
to 
slit 
a 
few 
throats. 
But 
l 
got 
it. 
The 
treasure. 
Trust 
me, 
my 
pungent 
friend. 
You'll 
get 
whats 
coming 
to 
you. 
Whats
coming 
to 
you. 
Quick, 
follow 
the 
trail. 
Faster. 
At 
last, 
after 
all 
my 
years 
of 
searching. 
The 
cave 
of 
wonders. 
Cave 
of 
wonders. 
By 
Allah. 
Now, 
remember. 
Bring 
me 
the 
lamp. 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
treasure 
is 
yours, 
but 
the 
lamp 
is 
mine. 
The 
lamp. 
The 
lamp. 
Jeez, 
where
did 
you 
dig 
this 
bozo 
up? 
Who 
disturbs 
my 
slumber? 
lt 
is 
l.
Gazeem. 
A 
humble 
thief. 
Know 
this. 
Only 
one 
may 
enter 
here. 
One 
whose 
worth 
lies 
far 
within. 
The 
diamond 
in 
the 
rough. 
What 
are 
you 
waiting 
for? 
Go 
on. 
No! 
Seek 
thee 
out 
the 
diamond 
in 
the 
rough. 
l 
can
not 
believe 
it. 
l 
just 
do
not 
believe 
it. 
We
are 
never 
going 
to 
get 
a 
hold 
of 
that 
stupid 
lamp. 
Just 
forget 
it. 
Look 
at 
this. 
l
am 
so 
ticked 
off 
that 
l
am 
molting. 
Patience, 
lago. 
Patience. 
Gazeem 
was 
obviously 
less 
than 
worthy. 
There
is 
a 
big 
surprise. 
l 
think 
l
am 
gonna 
have 
a 
heart 
attack 
and 
die 
from 
that 
surprise. 
What 
are 
we 
going 
to 
do? 
We 
got 
a 
big 
problem 
here, 
a 
big... 
Yes. 
Only 
one 
may 
enter. 
l 
must 
find 
this 
one, 
this 
diamond 
in 
the 
rough. 

On 
his 
way 
to 
the 
palace, 
l 
suppose. 
Another 
suitor 
for 
the 
princess. 
Out 
of 
my 
way, 
you 
filthy 
brats. 
Hey! 
lf 
l 
were 
as 
rich 
as 
you, 
l 
could 
afford 
some 
manners. 
l
will 
teach 
you 
some 
manners. 
Look 
at 
that, 
Abu. 
lts 
not 
every 
day 
you 
see 
a 
horse 
with 
two 
rear 
ends. 
You 
are 
a 
worthless 
street 
rat. 
You 
were 
born 
a 
street 
rat, 
you'll 
die 
a 
street 
rat 
and 
only 
your 
fleas 
will 
mourn 
you. 
l
am 
not 
worthless. 
And 
l 
don't 
have 
fleas. 
Come 
on, 
Abu. 
Lets 
go 
home. 
Riffraff, 
street 
rat 
l 
don't 
buy 
that 
lf 
only 
they'd 
look 
Closer 
Would 
they 
see 
a 
poor 
boy? 
No 
siree 
They'd 
find 
out 
Theres 
so 
muCh 
more 
to 
me 
Some 
day, 
Abu, 
things 
are 
gonna 
change. 
We'll 
be 
rich, 
live 
in 
a 
palace 
and 
never 
have 
any 
problems 
at 
all. - 
l
have 
never 
been 
so 
insulted. - 
Prince 
Achmed. 
Your
not 
leaving 
so 
soon, 
are 
you? 
Good 
luck 
marrying 
her 
off. 
Jasmine. 
Confound 
it, 
Rajah. 
So 
this 
is 
why 
Prince 
Achmed 
stormed 
out. 
Oh, 
Father. 
Rajah 
was 
just 
playing 
with 
him. 
Weren't 
you, 
Rajah? 
You 
were 
just 
playing 
with 
that 
over
dressed, 
self-
absorbed 
Prince 
Achmed, 
weren't 
you? 
Dearest, 
you've 
got
to 
stop 
rejecting 
every 
suitor 
who 
comes 
to 
call. 
The 
law 
says 
you 
must 
be 
married 
to 
a 
prince 
by 
your 
next 
birthday. - 
The 
law 
is 
wrong. 
- You've 
only 
got 
three 
more 
days. 
Father, 
l 
hate 
being 
forced 
into 
this. 
lf 
l 
do 
marry, 
l 
want 
it 
to 
be 
for 
love. 
Jasmine, 
its 
not 
only 
this 
law. 
lm 
not 
going 
to 
be 
around 
forever, 
and... 
l 
just 
want 
to 
make 
sure 
you're 
taken 
care 
of. 
- Provided 
for. 
- Please 
try 
to 
understand. 
l've 
never 
done 
a 
thing 
on 
my 
own. 
l've 
never 
had 
any 
real 
friends. 
Except 
you, 
Rajah. 
l've 
never 
even 
been 
outside 
the 
palace 
walls. 
But, 
Jasmine, 
you're 
a 
princess. 
Then 
maybe 
l 
don't 
wanna 
be 
a 
princess 
any
more. 
Allah 
forbid 
you 
should 
have 
any 
daughters. 
l 
don't 
know 
where 
she 
gets 
it 
from. 
Her 
mother 
wasn't 
nearly 
so 
picky. 
Jafar, 
my 
most 
trusted 
advisor. 
l 
am 
in 
desperate 
need 
of 
your 
wisdom. 
My 
life 
is 
but 
to 
serve 
you, 
my 
lord. 
lts 
this 
suitor 
business. 
Jasmine 
refuses 
to 
choose 
a 
husband. 
lm 
at 
my 
wits' 
end. 
Wits' 
end. 
Have 
a 
cracker, 
pretty 
Polly. 
Your 
Majesty 
certainly 
has 
a 
way 
with 
dumb 
animals. 
Now, 
then. 
Perhaps 
l 
can 
divine 
a 
solution 
to 
this 
thorny 
problem. 
lf 
anyone 
can 
help, 
its 
you. 
But 
it 
would 
require 
the 
use 
of 
the 
mystic 
blue 
diamond. 
My 
ring? 
- But 
its 
been 
in 
the 
family 
for 
years. - 
lt 
is 
necessary 
to 
find 
a 
suitor. 
Don't 
worry. 
Everything 
will 
be 
fine. 
Everything 
will 
be
fine. 
The 
diamond. 
Here, 
Jafar. 
Whatever 
you 
need 
will
be 
fine. 
You 
are 
most 
gracious, 
my 
liege. 
Now 
run 
along 
and 
play 
with 
your 
little 
toys. 
That 
will 
be 
pretty 
good. 
l 
can't 
take 
it 
anymore. 
lf 
l 
gotta 
choke 
down 
on 
one 
more 
of 
those 
moldy, 
disgusting 
crackers... 
Calm 
yourself,
lago. 
Soon 
l 
will 
be 
sultan, 
not 
that 
addle-
pated 
twit. 
And 
then 
l 
stuff 
the 
crackers 
down 
his 
throat. 

You 
must 
be 
hungry. 
- Here 
you 
go. 
- You 
had 
better 
be 
able 
to 
pay 
for 
that. - 
Pay? 
- No 
one 
steals 
from 
my 
cart. 
l
am 
sorry, 
sir. 
l 
do
not 
have 
any 
money. 
- Thief! 
- Please. 
lf 
you 
let 
me 
go 
to 
the 
palace, 
l 
can 
get 
some 
from 
the 
sultan. 
Do 
you 
know 
what 
the 
penalty 
is 
for 
stealing? 
No, 
please. 
Thank 
you, 
kind 
sir. 
l
am 
so 
glad 
you 
found 
her. 
- l
have
been 
looking 
for 
you. 
- What 
are 
you 
doing? 
- Just 
play 
along. 
- You 
know 
this 
girl? 
Sadly, 
yes. 
She 
is 
my 
sister. 
- She
is 
a 
little 
crazy. 
- She 
said 
she 
knew 
the 
sultan. 
She 
thinks 
the 
monkey 
is 
the 
sultan. 
O 
wise 
Sultan, 
how 
may 
l 
serve 
you? 
Tragic, 
is
not 
it? 
But 
no 
harm 
done. 
Come 
along, 
sis.
Time 
to 
go 
see 
the 
doctor. 
- Hello, 
doctor. 
How 
are 
you? 
- No, 
not 
that 
one. 
Come 
on, 
Sultan. 
What 
is 
it? 
Come 
back 
here, 
you 
little 
thieves. 
With 
all 
due 
respect, 
Your 
Rottenness, 
couldn't 
we 
just 
wait 
for 
a 
real 
storm? 
Save 
your 
breath, 
lago. 
Faster. 
Yes, 
oh 
mighty 
evil 
one. 
Part, 
sands 
of 
time. 
Reveal 
to 
me 
the 
one 
who 
can 
enter 
the 
cave. 
Yes. 
There 
he 
is. 
My 
diamond 
in 
the 
rough. 
Thats 
him? 
Thats 
the 
clown 
we've 
been 
waiting 
for? 
Lets 
have 
the 
guards 
extend 
him 
an 
invitation 
to 
the 
palace. 
- Shall 
we? 
- Swell. 
Almost 
there. 
l 
want 
to 
thank 
you 
for 
stopping 
that 
man. 
Forget 
it. 
So 
this 
is 
your 
first 
time 
in 
the 
market
place, 
huh? 
ls 
it 
that 
obvious? 
Well, 
you
do 
kind 
of 
stand 
out. 
l 
mean, 
you 
do
not 
seem 
to 
know 
how 
dangerous 
Agrabah 
can 
be. 
l
am 
a 
fast 
learner. 
Come 
on. 
This 
way. 
Watch 
your 
head 
there. 
Be 
careful. 
- 
ls 
this 
where 
you 
live? 
- 
Yep. 
Just 
me 
and 
Abu. 
- Come 
and 
go 
as 
we 
please. 
- That 
sounds 
fabulous. 
Well, 
it
is 
not 
much. 
But 
it
has 
got 
a 
great 
view. 
The 
palace 
looks 
pretty 
amazing, 
huh? 
lt
is 
wonder
full. 
Wonder 
what 
it
would 
be 
like 
to 
live 
there. 
And 
have 
servants
and 
valets. 
Oh, 
sure. 
People 
who 
tell 
you 
where 
to 
go 
and 
how 
to 
dress. 
That
is 
better 
than 
here. 
Always 
scraping 
for 
food 
and 
ducking 
guards. 
You
are 
not 
free 
to 
make 
your 
own 
choices. 
- Sometimes 
you 
feel 
so... 
- You
are 
just... 
trapped. 
So 
where 
are 
you 
from? 
What 
does 
it 
matter? 
l 
ran 
away 
and 
l 
am 
not 
going 
back. 
Really? 
How 
come? 
Why, 
you... 
My 
father 
is 
forcing 
me 
to 
get 
married. 
That
is 
awful. 
What? 
Abu says... 
that
is 
not 
fair. 
- 
Oh, 
did 
he? 
- 
Yeah. 
Of 
course. 
And 
does 
Abu 
have 
anything 
else 
to 
say? 
He 
wishes 
there 
was 
something 
he 
could 
do 
to 
help. 
Oh, 
boy. 
Tell 
him 
that
is 
very 
sweet. 
Here 
you 
are. 
They
are 
after 
me. 
They
are 
after 
you? -
 My 
father 
must 
have 
sent 
them... - 
Do 
you 
trust 
me? 
- What? 
- Do 
you 
trust 
me? 
- Yes. 
- Then 
jump! 
We 
just 
keep 
running 
in
to 
each 
other, 
do
not 
we, 
street 
rat? 
Run.
 Go, 
get 
out 
of 
here. 
lt
is 
the 
dungeon 
for 
you, 
boy.  
- Get 
off. 
- Let 
him 
go. 
Looky 
here, 
men. 
A 
street 
mouse. 
Unhand 
him. 
By 
order 
of 
the 
princess. 
- Princess 
Jasmine. 
- The 
princess? 
What 
are 
you 
doing 
here? 
And 
with 
this 
street 
rat? 
Thats 
not 
your 
concern. 
Do 
as 
l 
command. 
Release 
him. 
l 
would, 
Princess. 
Except 
my 
orders 
come 
from 
Jafar. - 
You'll 
have 
to 
take 
it 
up 
with 
him. - 
Believe 
me, 
l 
will.
 
Jafar? 
Princess. 
- How 
may 
l 
be 
of 
service 
to 
you? 
The 
guards 
took 
a 
boy 
from 
the 
market. 
On 
your 
orders. 
Your 
father 
has 
charged 
me 
with 
keeping 
peace 
in 
Agrabah. - 
The 
boy 
was 
a 
criminal. 
- What 
was 
his 
crime? 
- Why... 
- kidnapping 
the 
princess, 
of 
course. - 
He 
didn't 
kidnap 
me. 
l 
ran 
away. 
Oh, 
dear. 
How 
frightfully 
upsetting. 
Had 
l 
but 
known... 
What 
do 
you 
mean? 
Sadly, 
the 
boy's 
sentence 
has 
already 
been 
carried 
out. 
- What 
sentence? 
- Death. 
- By 
beheading. 
- No. 
l 
am 
exceedingly 
sorry, 
Princess. 
How 
could 
you? 
So. 
How 
did 
it
go? 
l 
think 
she 
took 
it 
rather 
well. 
lt
is 
all 
my 
fault, 
Rajah. 
l 
did
not 
even 
know 
his
name. 
She 
was 
the 
princess. 
l 
can
not 
believe 
it. 
l 
must 
have 
sounded 
so 
stupid 
to 
her. 
She 
was 
in 
trouble. 
She 
was 
worth 
it. 
Do
not 
worry 
l 
will 
never 
see 
her 
again. 
l
am 
a 
street 
rat 
remember
and 
there 
is 
a 
law. 
She
has
got 
to 
marry 
a 
prince. 
She 
deserves 
a 
prince. 
l
am 
a 
fool. 
You
are 
only 
a 
fool 
if 
you 
give 
up, 
boy. 
- Who 
are 
you? 
- A 
lowly 
prisoner 
like 
your
self. 
But 
together 
perhaps 
we 
can 
be 
more. - 
l
am 
listening. 
- There 
is 
a 
cave, 
boy. 
A 
cave 
of 
wonders, 
filled 
with 
treasures 
beyond 
your 
wildest 
dreams. 
Treasure 
enough 
to 
impress 
even 
your 
princess, 
l
would 
wager. 
But 
the 
law 
says 
that 
only 
a 
prince... 
Have 
not
you 
heard 
of 
the 
golden 
rule? 
Who
ever 
has 
the 
gold 
makes 
the 
rules. 
So 
why 
would 
you 
share 
this 
treasure 
with 
me? 
l 
need 
a 
young 
pair 
of 
legs 
and 
a 
strong 
back 
to 
go 
in 
after 
it. 
One 
problem. 
lt
is 
out 
there 
and 
we
are 
in 
here.  
Things 
are
not 
always 
what 
they 
seem. 
So. 
Do 
we 
have 
a 
deal? 
Who 
disturbs 
my 
slumber? 
lt 
is 
l. 
Aladdin. 
Proceed. 
Touch 
nothing 
but 
the 
lamp. 
Remember, 
boy. 
First 
fetch 
me 
the 
lamp. 
And 
then 
you 
shall 
have 
your 
reward. 

- Help 
me 
up. 
- Throw 
me 
the 
lamp. 
l 
can't 
hold 
on. 
Give 
me 
your 
hand. 
First 
give 
me 
the 
lamp. 
Yes! 
At 
last. 
- What 
are 
you 
doing? 
- Giving 
you 
your 
reward. 
Your 
eternal 
reward. 
lt's 
mine. 
lt's 
all 
mine. 
l
... 
where 
is 
it? 
No. 
No! 

Oh, 
dearest. 
What
is 
wrong? 
Jafar 
has 
done 
something 
terrible. 
there 
there, 
my 
dear. 
We
will 
set 
it 
right. 
Now, 
tell 
me 
everything. 

That 
two-
faced 
son 
of 
a 
jackal. 
Well, 
whoever 
he 
was, 
he
is 
long 
gone 
with 
that 
lamp. 
Why, 
you 
hairy 
little 
thief. 
lt 
looks 
like 
such 
a 
beat-
up, 
worth
less 
piece 
of 
junk. 
l 
think 
there
is 
something 
writ
ten 
here, 
but 
it's 
hard 
to 
make 
out. 
Ten 
thousand 
years 
will 
give 
you 
such 
a 
crick 
in 
the 
neck. 

You
are 
smaller 
than 
my 
last 
master. 
Wait 
a 
minute. 
l
am 
your 
master? 
That
is 
right. 
He 
can 
be 
taught. 
What 
would 
you 
wish 
of 
me? 
Genie 
of 
the 
Lamp. 
Right 
here 
for 
your 
very 
much 
wish-
fulfillment. 
Thank you. 
- Wish-
fulfillment? 
- Three, 
to 
be 
exact. 
lx-
nay 
on 
the 
wishing 
for
more 
wishes. 
That
is 
it. 
Three. 
No 
substitutions, 
exchanges 
or 
refunds. 
- You 
do
not 
realize 
what 
you 
got
here. 
 So 
why 
do
not 
you 
just 
ruminate 
whilst 
l 
illuminate 
the 
possibilities? 
So 
what
will 
it 
be, 
Master? 
You
are 
gonna 
grant 
me 
any 
three 
wishes 
l 
want, 
right? 
Almost. 
There 
are 
a 
few 
provisos, 
a 
couple 
of 
quid 
pro
quos. 
Like? 
Rule 
one. 
l 
can
not 
kill 
any
body. 
So 
do
not 
ask. 
Rule 
two. 
l can
not 
make 
anybody 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
any
body 
else. 
You 
little 
punim 
there. 
Rule 
three. 
l 
can
not 
bring 
people 
back 
from 
the 
dead. 
lt
is 
not 
a 
pretty 
picture. 
l 
do
not 
like 
doing 
it. 
Other
than 
that, 
you 
got 
it. 
Provisos? 
You 
mean 
limitations? 
On wishes? 
Some 
all-
powerful 
genie! 
Can
not 
even 
bring 
people 
back 
from 
the 
dead. 
l 
do
not 
know. 
He 
probably 
can
not 
even 
get 
us 
out 
of 
this 
cave. 

Jafar, 
this 
is 
an
outrage. 
lf 
it 
weren't 
for 
all 
your 
years 
of 
loyal 
service... 
From 
now 
on, 
you
are 
to 
discuss 
sentencing 
of 
prisoners 
with 
me. 
Before 
they 
are 
beheaded. 
l 
assure 
you, 
Your 
Highness, 
it 
won't 
happen 
again. 
Jasmine, 
Jafar, 
now 
lets 
put 
this 
whole 
messy 
business 
behind 
us. 
Please. 
My 
most 
abject 
and 
humblest 
apologies 
to 
you 
as 
well, 
Princess. 
At 
least 
some 
good 
will
 come 
of 
my 
being 
forced 
to 
marry. 
When 
l 
am 
queen, 
l 
will 
have 
the 
power 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
you. 
Thats 
nice. 
All 
settled, 
then. 
Now, 
Jasmine, 
getting 
back 
to 
this 
suitor 
business... 
Jasmine! 
lf 
only 
l 
had 
gotten 
that 
lamp. 
''l 
will 
have 
the 
power 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
you.'' 
To 
think 
we 
gotta 
keep 
kissing 
up 
to 
that 
chump 
and 
his 
chump 
daughter 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
our 
lives. 
No, 
lago. 
Only 
until 
she 
finds 
a 
chump 
husband. 
Then 
she
will
 have 
us 
banished. 
Or 
beheaded. 
Wait 
a 
minute. 
What 
if 
you 
were 
the 
chump 
husband? 
What? 
You 
marry 
the 
princess, 
right? 
And 
then 
you 
become 
the 
sultan. 
Marry 
the 
shrew. 
l 
become 
the 
sultan. 
The 
idea 
has 
merit. 
Yes, 
merit. 
And 
then 
we 
drop 
poppa-
in-
law 
and 
the 
little 
woman 
off 
a 
cliff. 
l 
love 
the 
way 
your 
foul 
little 
mind 
works. 

Well, 
how 
about 
that, 
Mr. 
Doubting 
Mustafa? 
You 
sure 
showed 
me. 
Now 
about 
my 
three 
wishes... 
Dost 
mine 
ears 
deceive 
me? 
Three? 
You 
are 
down 
by
 one, 
boy. 
No, 
l 
never 
actually 
wished 
to 
get 
out 
of
 the 
cave. 
You 
did 
that 
on 
your 
own. 
l 
feel 
sheepish. 
All 
right, 
you 
bad 
boy. 
But 
no 
more 
freebies. 
Fair 
deal. 
Three 
wishes. 
l 
want 
them 
to 
be 
good. 
What 
would 
you 
wish 
for? 
Me? 
No 
one
has 
asked 
me 
that 
before. 
Well, 
in 
my 
case... 
- 
Forget 
it. 
- What? 
- l 
can
not 
tell 
you. 
- Come 
on. 
Freedom. 
- You
are 
a 
prisoner? 
- lt
is 
part 
of 
the 
whole 
genie 
gig. 
Phenomenal 
cosmic 
powers. 
- ltty-
bitty 
living 
space. 
- Genie, 
that
is 
terrible. 
But 
oh, 
to 
be 
free. 
Not 
to 
have 
to 
go, 
''What 
do 
you 
need?'' 
To 
be 
my 
own 
master. 
Such 
a 
thing 
would 
be 
greater 
than 
all 
the 
magic
and 
treasures 
in 
the 
world. 
But 
what 
am 
l 
talking 
about? 
lts 
not 
going 
to 
happen. 
- 
Wake 
up. 
- Why 
not? 
The 
only 
way 
l 
get 
out 
of
 this 
is 
if 
my 
master
 wishes 
me 
out. 
So 
you 
can 
guess 
how 
often
 thats 
happened. 
l'll
 do 
it. 
l'll 
set 
you 
free. 
Yeah, 
right. 
l 
promise. 
After 
my 
first 
two 
wishes, 
l'll 
use 
my 
third 
wish 
to 
set 
you 
free. 
Well, 
heres
hoping. 
Lets 
make 
some 
magic. 
So 
how 
about 
it? 
What 
is 
it 
you 
want 
most? 
Well, 
theres 
this 
girl. 
Wrong. 
l 
can't 
make 
anybody 
fall 
in 
love, 
remember? 
But, 
Genie, 
shes 
smart 
and 
fun 
and... 
- Pretty? 
- Beautiful. 
Shes 
got 
these 
eyes 
that 
just... 
and 
this 
hair. 
And 
her 
smile... 
But 
shes 
the 
princess. 
To 
even 
have 
a 
chance, 
l
would 
have 
to 
be...
 - 
Can 
you 
make 
me 
a 
prince? 
- Lets 
see. 
''To 
make 
a 
prince.'' 
ls 
that 
official? 
Say 
the 
magic 
words. 
Genie, 
l 
wish 
for 
you 
to 
make 
me 
a 
prince. 

Hes 
got 
the 
outfit, 
hes 
got 
the 
elephant, 
but 
were
not 
through 
yet. 
Hang 
on 
to 
your 
turban, 
kid. 
Were 
gonna 
make 
you 
a 
star. 

Sire, 
l 
have 
found 
a
solution 
to 
the 
problem 
with 
your 
daughter. 
The 
problem 
with 
your 
daughter. - 
Really? 
- Right 
here. 
lf 
the 
princess 
has 
not 
chosen 
a 
husband 
by 
the 
appointed 
time, 
then 
the 
sultan 
shall 
choose 
for 
her. 
But 
Jasmine 
hated 
all 
those 
suitors. 
How 
could 
l 
choose 
someone 
she 
hates? 
Not 
to 
worry, 
my 
liege. 
There 
is 
more. 
lf 
in 
the 
event 
a 
suitable 
prince 
cannot 
be 
found, 
a 
princess 
must 
then 
be 
wed 
to... - 
lnteresting. 
- What? 
Who? 
The 
royal 
vizier. 
That 
would 
be... 
...me. 
But 
l 
thought 
only 
a 
prince 
can 
marry 
a 
princess. 
l
am 
quite 
sure. 
Desperate 
times 
call 
for 
desperate 
measures, 
my 
lord. 
Desperate 
measures. 
You 
will 
order 
the 
princess 
to 
marry 
me. 
l 
will 
order 
the 
princess 
to... 
But 
your
so 
old. 
The 
princess 
will 
marry 
me. 
The 
princess 
will
marry... 
What 
is 
that? 
That 
music? 
Jafar, 
you 
must 
come 
and 
see 
this. 
Splendid. 
Absolutely 
marvelous. 
Your 
Majesty, 
l 
have 
journeyed 
from 
afar
to 
seek 
your 
daughter's 
hand. 
Prince 
Ali 
Ababwa. 
Of 
course. 
lm 
delighted 
to 
meet 
you. 
This 
is 
my 
royal 
vizier, 
Jafar. 
Hes 
delighted 
too. 
Ecstatic. 
- lm 
afraid, 
Prince 
Abubu... 
- Ababwa. 
What
ever. 
You 
cannot 
just 
parade 
in 
here 
uninvited 
and 
expect 
to...
By 
Allah, 
this 
is 
quite 
a 
remarkable 
device. 
l 
do 
not 
suppose 
l 
might... 
Why 
certainly, 
Your 
Majesty. 
Allow 
me. 
Sire. 
l 
must 
advise 
against 
this. 
Oh, 
button 
up, 
Jafar. 
Learn 
to 
have 
a 
little 
fun. 
Just 
where 
did 
you 
say 
you 
were 
from?  
Much 
farther 
than 
you
have 
traveled, 
l
am 
sure. 
- Try 
me. 
- Duck, 
Polly. 
Watch 
it, 
you 
dumb 
rug. 
Have 
a 
cracker. 
Out 
the 
way, 
lm 
coming 
in 
to 
land. 
Jafar, 
watch 
this. 
- Spectacular, 
Your 
Highness. 
- lt 
was 
lovely. 
Yes, 
l 
do 
seem 
to 
have 
a 
knack 
for 
it. 
This 
is 
a 
very 
impressive 
youth. 
And 
a 
prince 
besides. 
lf 
we're 
lucky, 
you 
won't 
have 
to 
marry 
Jasmine 
after 
all. 
- l 
don't 
trust 
him, 
sire. 
- Nonsense. 
One 
thing 
l 
pride 
myself 
on. 
l
am 
an 
excellent 
judge 
of 
character. 
Oh, 
excellent 
judge, 
yeah, 
sure. 
Not. 
Jasmine 
will 
like 
this 
one. 
And 
lm 
sure 
l
will 
like 
Princess 
Jasmine. 
Your 
Highness, 
no. 
l 
must 
intercede 
on 
Jasmine's 
behalf. 
This 
boy 
is 
no 
different 
from 
the 
others. 
What 
makes 
him 
think 
he 
is 
worthy
of
the
princess? 
Your 
Majesty, 
l 
am 
Prince 
Ali 
Ababwa. 
Just 
let 
her 
meet 
me. 
l 
will 
win 
your 
daughter. 
How 
dare 
you? 
All 
of 
you. 
Standing 
around 
deciding 
my 
future? 
l 
am 
not 
a 
prize 
to 
be 
won. 
Oh, 
dear. 
Don't 
worry, 
Prince 
Ali. 
Just 
give 
Jasmine 
time 
to 
cool 
down. 
l 
think 
its 
time 
to 
say 
good
bye 
to 
Prince 
Abubu. 
What 
am 
l 
going 
to 
do? 
Jasmine 
will
not 
even 
let 
me 
talk 
to 
her. 
l 
should 
have 
known 
l 
could
not 
pull 
off 
this 
stupid 
prince 
wish. 
Genie, 
l 
need 
help. 
- All 
right, 
sparky, 
here
is 
the 
deal. 
lf 
you 
want 
to 
court 
the 
lady, 
you 
got 
to 
be 
a 
straight 
shooter. 
Do 
ya 
got 
it? 
What? 
Tell 
her 
the 
truth. 
No 
way. 
lf 
Jasmine 
found 
out 
l 
was 
some 
crummy 
street 
rat, 
she 
would 
laugh 
at 
me. 
A 
woman 
appreciates 
a 
man 
who 
can 
make 
her 
laugh. 
Al, 
all 
joking 
aside, 
you 
really 
ought 
to 
be 
yourself.
 That
is 
the 
last 
thing 
l 
want 
to 
be. 
Ok, 
l
am 
going 
to 
go 
see 
her. 
l 
got 
to 
be 
smooth, 
cool, 
confident. 
How 
do 
l 
look? 
Like 
a 
prince. 
Princess 
Jasmine? 
- Who
is 
there? 
- lt
is 
me, 
Prince 
Ali
Ababwa. 
- l 
do 
not 
want 
to 
see 
you. 
- Please, 
Princess. 
Give 
me 
a 
chance. - 
Leave 
me 
alone. 
- Down, 
kitty. 
So 
how
is 
our 
little 
beau 
doing? 
Good 
kitty. 
Take 
off. 
- Down, 
kitty. 
- Wait. 
Do 
l 
know 
you? 
No. 
You 
remind 
me 
of 
someone 
l 
met 
in 
the 
market
place. 
The 
market
place? 
l 
have 
servants 
who 
go 
to 
the 
market
place 
for 
me. 
Why, 
l 
even 
have 
servants 
who 
go 
to 
the 
marketplace 
for 
my 
servants. 
So 
it 
could
not 
have 
been 
me 
you 
met. 
No. 
- l 
guess 
not. 
- 
Enough 
about 
you. 
Talk 
about
her.  
She
is 
smart, 
fun. 
The 
hair, 
the 
eyes. 
Any
thing. 
Pick 
a 
feature. 
Princess 
Jasmine, 
you
are 
very... 
Wonderful. 
Magnificent. 
Punctual. 
- Punctual. 
- Sorry. 
- Beautiful. 
- Nice 
recovery. 
- l
am 
rich 
too, 
you 
know. 
- Yeah. 
- The 
daughter 
of 
a 
sultan. 
- l 
know. 
A 
fine 
prize 
for 
any 
prince 
to 
marry. 
Right. 
A 
prince 
like 
me. 
- Warning. 
- Right. 
A 
prince 
like 
you. 
And 
every 
other 
stuffed
shirt, 
swaggering 
peacock 
l've 
met. 
May
day. 
Just 
go 
jump 
off 
a 
balcony. 
- Stop 
her. 
Want 
me 
to 
sting 
her? 
-buzz
off!
fine
but
remember
bee 
yourself.
yeah 
right.
- What? 
You
are 
right. 
You 
are
not 
just 
some 
prize 
to 
be 
won. 
You 
should 
be 
free 
to 
make 
your 
own 
choice. 
l
will 
go. 
- No. 
- What? 
How... 
- How 
are 
you 
doing 
that? 
- lt
is 
a 
magic 
carpet. 
lt
is 
lovely. 
You... 
You 
do
not 
want 
to 
go 
for 
a 
ride, 
do 
you? 
We 
could 
get 
out
of 
the 
palace. 
See 
the 
world. 
- ls 
it 
safe? 
- Sure. 
Do 
you 
trust 
me? 
- What? 
- Do 
you 
trust 
me? 
Yes. 
- lt
is 
all 
so 
magical. 
- Yeah. 
- lt
is 
all 
so 
magical. 
- Yeah. 
lt
is 
a 
shame 
Abu 
had 
to 
miss 
this. 
He 
hates 
fire
works. 
He 
does
not 
really 
like 
flying 
either. 
That 
is... 
- Oh, 
no. 
- You 
are 
the 
boy 
from 
the 
market. - 
l 
knew 
it! 
Why 
did 
you 
lie
to 
me? - 
l
am 
sorry. 
Did 
you 
think 
l 
was 
stupid? 
That 
l 
would
not 
figure 
it 
out? 
No, 
l 
mean... 
l 
hoped 
you 
would
not. - 
That
is 
not 
what 
l 
meant. 
- Who 
are 
you? 
Tell 
me 
the 
truth. 
The 
truth? 
The 
truth... 
The 
truth 
is, 
l 
some
times 
dress 
as 
a 
commoner. 
To 
escape 
the 
pressures 
of 
palace 
life. 
But 
l 
really 
am 
a 
prince. 
Why 
did
not 
you 
just 
tell 
me? 
Well, 
you 
know. 
Royalty 
going 
out 
into 
the 
city 
in 
disguise. 
Sounds 
a 
little 
strange, 
do
not 
you 
think? 
Not 
that 
strange. 
Good 
night, 
my 
handsome 
prince. 
Sleep 
well, 
Princess. 
Yes! 
For 
the 
first 
time 
in 
my 
life, 
things 
are 
starting 
to 
go 
right. 
Hold 
him. 
lm 
afraid 
you've 
worn 
out 
your 
welcome, 
Prince 
Abubu. 
- Why 
you 
dirty, 
rotten... 
- Make 
sure 
hes 
never 
found. 
Never 
fails. 
Get 
in 
the 
bath 
and 
theres 
a 
rub 
at
the 
lamp. 
Hello? 
Al? 
Kid, 
snap 
out 
of 
it. 
l 
can't 
help 
you 
unless 
you 
make 
a 
wish. 
You 
have 
to 
say, 
''Genie, 
l 
want 
you 
to 
save 
my 
life.''
OK? 
Come 
on, 
Aladdin. 
l'll 
take 
that 
as 
a 
yes. 
Up 
scope. 
Don't 
you 
scare 
me 
like 
that. 
Genie, 
l... 
- Thanks, 
Genie. 
- Oh, 
Al. 
lm 
getting 
kind 
of 
fond 
of 
you, 
kid. 
Not 
that 
l 
wanna 
pick 
out 
curtains. 
Oh, 
Father. 
l 
just 
had 
the 
most 
wonderful 
time. - 
lm 
so 
happy. 
- You 
should 
be, 
Jasmine. 
l 
have
chosen 
a 
husband 
for 
you. - 
What? 
- You 
will 
wed 
Jafar. 
You
are 
speechless, 
l 
see. 
A 
fine 
quality 
in 
a 
wife. 
l 
will 
never 
marry 
you. 
- Father, 
l 
choose 
Prince 
Ali. 
- 
Prince 
Ali 
left. 
Better 
check 
your 
crystal 
ball 
again. - 
Prince 
Ali. 
- How 
in 
the... 
Tell 
them 
the 
truth, 
Jafar. 
You 
tried 
to 
have 
me 
killed. 
What 
ridiculous 
nonsense, 
Your 
Highness. 
He
is 
obviously 
lying. 
Obviously 
lying. 
- Father, 
whats 
wrong 
with 
you? - 
l 
know 
whats 
wrong. 
- Oh, 
my. 
- Your 
Highness. 
Jafar's 
been 
controlling 
you 
with 
this. 
What? 
Jafar? 
You 
low 
traitor. 
Your 
Majesty, 
all 
this 
can 
be 
explained. - 
Guards. 
- Well, 
thats 
it. 
We're 
dead. 
Just 
dig 
a 
grave 
for 
both 
of 
us. 
Arrest 
Jafar 
at 
once. 
This 
is 
not 
done 
yet, 
boy. 
Find 
him. 
Search 
everywhere. 
- Jasmine, 
are 
you 
all 
right? 
- Yes. 
Jafar, 
my 
most 
trusted 
counselor, 
plotting 
against 
me 
all 
this 
time. 
This 
is 
horrible, 
just 
horrible. 
How 
will 
l 
ever... 
Can 
this 
be 
true? 
My 
daughter
has 
finally 
chosen 
a 
suitor? 
Praise 
Allah. 
You 
brilliant 
boy. 
l 
could 
kiss 
you. 
l 
will
not. 
l
will 
leave 
that 
to 
my... 
But 
you 
two 
will 
be 
wed 
at 
once. 
Yes, 
and 
you
will 
be 
happy 
and 
prosperous. 
And 
then 
you, 
my 
boy, 
will 
become 
sultan. 
- Sultan? 
- Yes. 
A 
fine 
youth 
such 
as 
yourself. 
A 
person 
of 
your 
unimpeachable 
moral 
character 
is 
exactly 
what 
this 
kingdom 
needs. 
We 
gotta 
get 
outta 
here. 
l 
gotta 
start 
packing. 
Only 
essentials. 
We 
gotta 
travel 
light. 
Bring 
the 
guns, 
the knives... 
And 
how 
about 
this 
picture? 
l 
don't 
know. 
l 
think 
lm 
making 
a 
weird 
face. 
Oh, 
boy. 
Hes 
cracked. 
Hes 
gone 
nuts. 
Get 
a 
grip. 
Good 
grip. 
Prince 
Ali 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
that 
ragged
urchin 
Aladdin. 
He 
has 
the 
lamp, 
lago. 
- Why, 
that 
miserable... 
- But 
you 
will 
relieve 
him 
of 
it. 
Me? 
Sultan? 
They 
want 
me 
to 
be 
sultan? 
Hail 
the 
Conquering 
hero 
You've 
just 
won 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
princess. 
What 
are 
you 
gonna 
do 
next? 
Your 
line 
is, 
''lm 
going 
to 
free 
the 
genie.'' - 
Any 
time. 
- Genie... 
- l 
can't. 
- Sure 
you 
can. 
You 
just 
go, 
''Genie, 
l 
wish 
you 
free.'' 
lm 
serious. 
Look, 
lm 
sorry, 
l 
really 
am. 
But 
they 
wanna
make 
me 
sultan. 
No, 
they 
wanna 
make 
Prince 
Ali 
sultan. 
Without 
you, 
lm 
just 
Aladdin. 
- 
Al, 
you 
won. 
- Because 
of 
you. 
People 
only 
think 
lm 
worth 
anything 
because 
of 
you. 
What 
if 
they 
find 
out 
lm 
not 
a 
prince? 
What 
if 
Jasmine 
finds 
out? 
l'd 
lose 
her. 
l 
can't 
keep 
this 
up 
on 
my 
own. 
l 
can't 
wish 
you 
free. 
l 
understand. 
After 
all, 
you've
lied 
to 
everyone 
else. 
l 
was 
beginning 
to 
feel 
left 
out. 
Now, 
if 
you'll 
excuse 
me, 
master. 
Genie, 
lm 
really 
sorry. 
Well, 
fine. 
Then 
just 
stay 
in 
there. 
What 
are 
you 
guys 
looking 
at? 
Look, 
l... 
Abu, 
lm 
sorry. 
l 
didn't... 
Wait. 
Come 
on. 
What 
am 
l 
doing? 
Genies
right. 
l 
gotta 
tell 
Jasmine 
the 
truth. 
Ali, 
will 
you 
come 
here? 
Here 
goes. 
Jasmine, 
where 
are 
you? 
- Out 
in 
the 
menagerie. 
Hurry. 
- lm 
coming. 
You 
got 
a 
problem, 
pinky? 
Jerk. 
Jafars
gonna 
be 
happy 
to 
see 
you.  
- Excellent 
work, 
lago. 
- Ah, 
go 
on. 
No, 
really. 
On 
a 
scale 
of 
one 
to 
ten, 
you 
are 
an 
eleven. 
Oh, 
Jafar, 
your 
too 
kind. 
lm 
embarrassed. 
lm 
blushing. 
People 
of 
Agrabah, 
my 
daughter 
has 
finally 
chosen 
a 
suitor. 
- He 
is 
a 
man 
of 
integrity. 
- Jasmine? 
Ali, 
where 
you 
have 
you 
been? 
Theres 
something 
l 
gotta 
tell 
you. 
The 
whole 
kingdom 
has 
turned 
out 
for 
Father's 
announcement. 
Jasmine, 
listen 
to 
me. 
Please, 
you 
dont 
understand. 
- Good 
luck. 
- Prince 
Ali 
Ababwa. 
Look 
at 
them. 
Cheering 
that 
little 
pipsqueak. 
Let 
them 
cheer. 
You 
know, 
Al, 
l
am 
get 
really... 
l 
dont 
think 
your

Tonight 
the 
part 
of 
Al 
will 
be 
played
by 
a 
tall, 
dark 
and 
sinister 
ugly 
man. - 
l 
am 
your 
master 
now. 
- l 
was 
afraid 
of 
that. 
Genie, 
grant 
me 
my 
first 
wish. 
l 
wish 
to 
rule 
on 
high. 
As 
sultan. 
Bless 
my 
soul. 
What 
is 
this? 
Whats

on? - 
Oh, 
my 
goodness. 
What
is 
happening?
 - Father! 
Jafar, 
you 
vile 
betrayer. 
Thats
Sultan 
Vile 
Betrayer 
to 
you. 
Oh,

We'll

The

- Finders 
keepers, 
Abubu. 
Genie,

Sorry,

new 
master

Jafar,

But

new 
order 
now. 
My 
order. 
Finally 
you 
will 
bow 
to 
me. 
We 
will 
never 
bow 
to 
you. 
Why 
am 
l 
not 
surprised? 
lf 
you 
wont 
bow 
be
for
a 
sultan, 
then 
you 
will 
cower 
before 
a 
sorcerer. 
Genie, 
my 
second 
wish. 
l 
wish 
to 
be 
the 
most 
powerful 
sorcerer 
in 
the 
world. 
Genie,

Ladie
and 
gentlemen,

warm 
Agrabah 
welcome

Jafar. 
Now,

Oh, 
Princess.

This

the 
chance. 
Are

OK? 
lm 
sorry, 
Abu.

Somehow.

Gotta

Jafar, 
leave 
him 
alone. 
lt 
pains
me 
to 
see 
you 
reduced 
to 
this, 
Jasmine. 
A 
beautiful 
desert 
bloom 
such 
as 
yourself 
should 
be 
on 
the 
arm 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
man 
in 
the 
world. 
What 
do 
you 
say, 
my 
dear? 
Why, 
with 
you 
as 
my 
queen... 
Never. 
l'll 
teach 
you 
some 
respect. 
No. 
Genie. 
l 
have 
decided 
to 
make 
my 
final 
wish. 
l 
wish 
for 
Princess 
Jasmine 
to 
fall 
desperately 
in 
love 
with 
me. 
Master, 
there 
are 
a 
few 
addendas, 
some 
quid 
pro 
quo. 
Dont 
talk 
back
to
me, 
you 
big 
blue 
lout. 
You 
will
do 
what 
l 
order 
you 
to 
do, 
slave. 
jafar

how 
incredibly
handsome 
you 
are. 
Thats

Now, 
pussy

me 
more 
about 
myself. 
You're

dark. 
Well-
dressed. 
Al. 
Little 
buddy. 
l

nice 
long 
nose.

so 
- What 
are 
you 
gonna 
do? 
- 
lm 
a 
street 
rat, 
remember? 
- l
will 
improvise. 
- Cute 
little 
gaps 
between 
your 
teeth. 
Go 
on. 
And 
your 
beard 
is 
so... 
twisted. 
You've 
stolen 
my 
heart. 
And 
the 
street 
rat? 
What 
street 
rat? 
That 
was... 
You. 
How 
many 
times 
do 
l 
have 
to 
kill 
you, 
boy? 
Get 
the 
lamp. 
No. 
Princess, 
your 
time 
is 
up. 
Nice 
shot, 
Jafar. 
Dont 
toy 
with 
me. 
Things 
are 
unraveling 
fast 
now, 
boy. 
Get 
the 
point? 
lm 
just 
getting 
warmed 
up. 
Are 
you 
afraid 
to 
fight 
me 
yourself, 
you 
cowardly 
snake? 
A 
snake, 
am 
l? 
Perhaps 
you'd  
like 
to 
see 
how 
snake
like 
l 
can 
be. 
Stick 
that 
sword 
into 
that 
snake. 
You 
stay 
out 
of 
this. 
Jafar, 
Jafar, 
hes 
our 
man. 
lf 
he 
cant
do 
it... 
Great! 
Jasmine, 
hang 
on. 
You 
little 
fool. 
You 
thought 
you 
could 
defeat 
the 
most 
powerful 
being 
on 
Earth. 
Squeeze 
him, 
Jafar. 
Squeeze 
him 
like 
a... 
Without 
the 
genie, 
boy, 
your
nothing. 
The 
genie. 
The 
genie 
has 
more 
power 
than 
youll
ever 
have. 
- What!?
- He 
gave 
you 
your 
power. 
- He 
can 
take 
it 
away. 
- Al, 
why 
are 
you 
bringing 
me 
into 
this? 
Face 
it, 
Jafar. 
Your 
still 
just 
second-
best. 
Your 
right. 
His 
power 
does 
exceed 
my 
own. 
But 
not 
for 
long. 
The 
boy
is 
crazy. 
Hes 
a 
little 
punch-
drunk. 
- One 
too 
many 
hits 
with 
the 
snake. - 
Slave, 
l 
make 
my 
third 
wish. 
l 
wish 
to 
be 
an 
all-
powerful 
genie. 
Alright. 
Your 
wish 
is 
my 
command. 
Way 
to 
go, 
Al. 
Yes. 
The 
power. 
The 
absolute 
power. 
- What 
have 
you 
done? 
- Trust 
me. 
The 
universe 
is 
mine 
to 
command. 
To 
control. 
Not 
so 
fast, 
Jafar. 
Arent 
you 
forgetting 
something? 
You 
wanted 
to 
be 
a 
genie? 
You 
got 
it. - 
What? 
- 
And 
everything 
that 
goes 
with 
it. 
No. 
- l
am 
getting 
out
of 
here. 
- Phenomenal 
cosmic 
powers. 
ltty-
bitty 
living 
space. 
Al, 
you 
little 
genius, 
you. 
Get 
your 
blasted 
beak 
out 
of 
my 
face. - 
Shut 
up, 
you 
moron. 
- Do
not 
tell 
me 
to 
shut 
up. 
Allow 
me. 
Ten 
thousand 
years 
in 
a 
cave 
of 
wonders 
ought 
to 
chill 
him 
out. 
Shut 
up. 
lm

a 
prince.

why 
you

Well,

bye. 
That 
stupid 
law. 
This 
is
not 
fair. 
l 
love 
you. 
Al, 
no 
problem. 
You

one 
wish 
left. 
Say 
the 
word 
and

a 
prince 
again. 
But 
what 
about 
your 
freedom? 
Hey, 
its 
only 
an 
eternity 
of 
servitude. 
This 
is 
love. 
Al, 
your
not 
going 
to 
find 
another 
girl 
like 
her 
in 
a 
million 
years. 
Believe 
me,

But

No

No

what 
anybody 
says,

always 
be 
a 
prince 
to 
me. 
That
is 
right. 
You

proven 
your 
worth 
as 
far 
as 
lm 
concerned. 
lts 
that 
law 
thats 
the 
problem. - 
Father? - 
Well,

From
