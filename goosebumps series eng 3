00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:03,367
Crystal, this is crazy.
Why does this cat want me?

118
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:06,867
Not you, Allison.
He wants your life force.

119
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,867
Rip isn't an ordinary cat,

120
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:12,867
but he still had nine lives,
and now he's almost run out of them,

121
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:16,367
so he's gotta find some way
to get 'em back.

122
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:19,867
Every time he scratches you,
a bit of your life goes into him,

123
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:22,367
and a bit of him goes into you.

124
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:25,867
Is that why I'm eating raw fish?

125
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:29,367
And the more he scratches you,
the worse it'll get.

126
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:33,367
- But how do I stop him?
- I don't know.

127
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:37,867
Mom and I tried,
but he just kept coming back.

128
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:40,367
You said he was desperate.

129
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,867
That means I have to get him...

130
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:45,367
before he gets me.

131
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,867
He must have a hiding place.

132
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:50,367
Somewhere he goes between lives.

133
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:52,367
Yeah, but that could be anywhere.

134
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:55,800
Could be, but it isn't.

135
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,800
He goes someplace
he remembers from his first life.

136
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,600
The first time he died--
where did you bury him?

It's the only way
we can stop the monster.

and destroy his bones.

made its way into open water.

to get us out of the way.

246
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,333
Why?

247
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,833
So he could have D-13 all to himself.

248
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,333
He was probably planning to
sell it to a company

249
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,000
with no regard for the consequences.

250
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So he could get rich
by hurting innocent people.

[ Murmuring ]

252
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,167
We'll go get Ritter.

253
00:17:57,167 --> 00:18:00,667
[ All Murmuring ]
Get Ritter! Get Ritter! Get Ritter!

254
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,600
Huh?

255
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
No.

256
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,000
No!

257
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,267
No! Stay away!

258
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,267
Stay away from me!

259
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,100
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:51,833
[ Luis ]
Hello, Dr. Ritter.

261
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,333
Going somewhere?

262
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:02,433
- [ Roars ]
- No!

263
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
- See you, Luis.
- Take care.

264
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Well, that's the last of the antidote.

265
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,167
Good.

266
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,167
According to my calculations,

267
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,600
that should get rid of
all traces of D-13.

268
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,100
Okay, uh, what about the giant fish?
The others?

269
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,100
Once the antidote starts to work,

270
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,100
they should revert to normal size
within the next 48 hours.

271
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,100
How are you feeling?

272
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,100
I couldn't be better.
I haven't got a fin or scale on me.

273
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,600
But I've kind of, uh,
lost my taste for seafood.

[ Chuckling ]

275
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:54,533
I promise you guys,

276
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:57,533
the rest of your vacation
will be completely normal.

277
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:00,500
No mad scientists, no monsters.
Just a nice, quiet summer.

278
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,000
Good.
Just one thing, though.

279
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,500
What do you think happened to Ritter?

280
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,167
Yeah. He sorta disappeared
after those fish people got hold of him.

281
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:14,667
Well, I don't think
we've heard the last of him.

282
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,033
Guys like Ritter
always show up sooner or later.

[ Female Barker ]
Come on down, folks!

284
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
See the fish man!

285
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,400
He's half man and half fish!

286
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,900
And he's alive! Come on down!

287
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,900
Oh, don't be shy, sweetie.

288
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Go on in.

289
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,367
See, he's the fish man!
Half man, half fish!

290
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:42,367
You won't believe it!
You have to see it with your own eyes!

291
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,867
Man, what a rip-off.

292
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:48,867
That looks totally fake.
