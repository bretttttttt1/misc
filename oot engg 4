<both>     I'll come back to haunt you!

 - A circle of light appears on a platform. It takes Link to

  Chamber of the Sages

 - Nabooru appears before Link.

Nabooru    Kid, let me thank you. Heheheh...look what the little kid has become
            in the past seven years--a competent swordsman!

            By the way... I really messed up... I was brainwashed by those old
            witches and used by Ganondorf to do his evil will... But isn't it
            funny? That a person like me could turn out to be the Sage of
            Spirit! And now, I'm going to fight them as one of the six Sages!
            Heh heh... I'm going to pay them back for what they did to me!

            Kid... No... Link, the Hero of Time! Instead of keeping the promise
            I made back then, I give you this Medallion! Take it!

     You received the Spirit Medallion! Nabooru awakens as a Sage and
            adds her power to yours!

Nabooru    If only I knew you would become such a handsome man... I should have
            kept the promise I made back then...

Rauru      Link, the hero! Finally, all of us, the six Sages, have been
            awakened! The time for the final showdown with the King of Evil
            has come!

            Before that, though, you should meet the one who is waiting for
            you... The one who is waiting for you at the Temple of Time....

       Ganon's Castle      

 Hyrule Castle Town  -  Temple of Time  

Sheik      I have been waiting for you, Link.

            Link, the Hero of Time... You have overcome many hardships and
            awakened six Sages. And now, you have a final challenge, a showdown
            with Ganondorf, the King of Evil....

            Before that...I have things I want to tell only to you.
            Please listen.

            Another unknown legend of the Triforce passed down by the shadow
            folk, the Sheikahs....

            If you would seek the sacred triangle, listen well... The resting
            place of the sacred triangle, the Sacred Realm, is a mirror that
            reflects what is in the heart...the heart of one who enters it...
            If an evil heart, the Realm will become full of evil; if pure,
            the Realm will become a paradise.

            The Triforce...the sacred triangle...it is a balance that weighs
            the three forces Power, Wisdom and Courage. If the heart of the
            one who holds the sacred triangle has all three forces in balance,
            that one will gain the True Force to govern all. But, if that one's
            heart is not in balance, the Triforce will separate into three
            parts Power, Wisdom and Courage.

            Only one part will remain for the one who touched the Triforce...
            the part representing the force that one most believes in. If that
            one seeks the True Force, that one must acquire the two lost parts.
            Those two parts will be held within others chosen by destiny,
            who will bear the Triforce mark on the backs of their hands.

            Seven years ago, Ganondorf, the King of Thieves, used the door you
            opened in the Temple of Time and entered the Sacred Realm. But when
            he laid his hands on the Triforce, the legend came true.

            The Triforce separated into three parts. Only the Triforce of Power
            remained in Ganondorf's hand. The strength of the Triforce of Power
            enabled him to become a mighty, evil king, but his dark ambitions
            were not satisfied. To gain complete mastery of the world, Ganondorf
            started looking for those chosen by destiny to hold the two other
            Triforce parts.

            The one who holds the Triforce of Courage is... You, Link!

            And the other, who holds the Triforce of Wisdom...is the seventh
            Sage, who is destined to be the leader of them all...

 - The symbol of the Triforce appears upon the back of Sheik's left hand,
    the lower-left triangle shining brighter than the others.

    Light fills the room, resonating from the Triforce mark. As it fades,
    Zelda appears in the place of Sheik.

Zelda      It is I, the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda.

            I apologize for meeting you in disguise, but it was necessary to
            hide from the King of Evil. Please forgive me...

            On that day, seven years ago, Ganondorf attacked Hyrule Castle.
            I saw you as I was escaping from the castle with my attendant, Impa.
            I thought I should entrust the Ocarina to you... I thought that
            would be our best chance...

            As long as you had the Ocarina in your possession, I thought
            Ganondorf could never enter the Sacred Realm, but...something I
            could never expect happened...

            After you opened the door of time, the Master Sword sealed you away
            in the Sacred Realm... Your spirit remained in the Sacred Realm...
            and then the Triforce fell into Ganondorf's hands. he went on to
            invade the Sacred Realm... Ganondorf had become the Evil King,
            and the Sacred Realm became a world of evil. All of this is an
            unfortunate coincidence.

            I passed myself off as a Sheikah and hoped that you would return.
            I waited for seven years... And...now you are back. The dark age
            ruled by Ganondorf the Evil King will end!

            The six Sages will open the sealed door and lure Ganondorf back
            into the Sacred Realm. I will then seal the door to the Sacred Realm
            from this world. Thus, Ganondorf the Evil King will vanish from
            Hyrule.

            Link... In order to do this, I need your courage again. Please
            protect me while I do my part. And here is a weapon that can
            penetrate the Evil King's defenses... The power given to the chosen
            ones... The sacred Arrow of Light!!!

     You got the Light Arrow! Set it to {C} and your arrows will be
            powered up! The light of justice will smite evil!

 - The temple begins to tremble.

Zelda      That rumbling...It can't be!?

 - A crystal surrounds Zelda. Ganondorf transmits his voice.

Ganondorf  Princess Zelda...you foolish traitor!

            I commend you for avoiding my pursuit for seven long years.
            But you let your guard down... I knew you would appear if I
            let this kid wander around!

            My only mistake was to slightly underestimate the power of this
            kid...

 - The crystal floats into the air.

Ganondorf  No... It was not the kid's power I misjudged, it was the power of
            the Triforce of Courage! But, with the Triforce of Wisdom that Zelda
            has... When I obtain these two Triforces... Then, I will become
            the true ruler of the world!!

            If you want to rescue Zelda, come to my castle!

 - The crystal disappears. Ganondorf laughs.

  Ganon's Castle 

 - The castle floats above a pit of lava where Hyrule Castle once stood.

Rauru      Link...can you hear me? It's Rauru, the Sage.

            We six will gather our power to create a bridge to the castle
            where Ganondorf dwells... The castle's keep, which is known as
            Ganon's Tower, is protected by six evil barriers. Bring down the
            six barriers and save Princess Zelda!!

 - A bridge appears, formed by light of the colors associated with each sage.

 - Upon the destruction of an object that sustains the barriers, the sage
    associated with said object's color will appear before Link.

Rauru      The Light Barrier is dispelled! Hurry!

Saria      The Forest Barrier is dispelled! Hurry up, Link!

Darunia    The Fire Barrier is dispelled! Hurry up, Brother!

Ruto       The Water Barrier is dispelled! Hurry up!

Impa       The Shadow Barrier is dispelled! Please save the Princess!

Nabooru    The Spirit Barrier is dispelled! Hurry up, kid!

 - Ganondorf is playing an organ in the castle's highest room. Zelda is present
    within the same crystal as before.

    The Triforce marks on Link's and Zelda's hands glow. Ganondorf stops playing
    the organ.

Ganondorf  The Triforce parts are resonating... They are combining into one
            again... The two Triforce parts that I could not capture on that day
            seven years ago... I didn't expect they would be hidden within you
            two! And now, finally, all the Triforce parts have gathered here!

            These toys are too much for you! I command you to return them to me!

 - He raises his right hand, the symbol of the Triforce glowing thereupon.
    A stream of dark light surges towards Link.

Navi       Link! I can't help you! Because of the waves of darkness, I can't
            get close! I'm sorry, Link!

 - "Great King of Evil Ganondorf" begins to hover in the air.

    Upon defeating him

Ganondorf  The Great Evil King Ganondorf...beaten by this kid?!

 - He coughs up blood.

Ganondorf  Link....!

 - Ganondorf conjours a blast of magic that destroys the roof and walls of
    the room. Thereafter, he collapses.

    The crystal containing Zelda disappears.

Zelda      Ganondorf...pitiful man... Without a strong, righteous mind,
            he could not control the power of the gods...and...

 - The castle begins to tremble violently.

Zelda      Link, listen to me! This tower will collapse soon! With his last
            breath, Ganondorf is trying to crush us in the ruins of the tower!
            We need to hurry and escape!

            Please follow me!

 - She begins to lead Link out of the castle. In a certain room, she is
    surrounded by a circle of fire, which is extinguished upon the nearby
    Stalfos' defeat.

Zelda      Thank you, Link. Now, let's hurry!

 - Zelda and Link escape the castle shortly before it falls apart.

Zelda      It's over...it's finally over...

Navi       Link... I'm sorry I couldn't help you in the battle before!

 - A rumble is heard.

Zelda      What is that sound?

 - As Link draws near the center of the floating island, a ring of fire
    appears along its perimeter.

    Ganondorf rises from the debris. He uses the Triforce of Power to assume
    a form referred to as "Ganon" by Navi, in which he appears similar to a
    large, anthropomorphic pig.

    He knocks the Master Sword out of Link's hands, to the fire's exterior.

Navi       There's no way he's going to hold me back again! This time,
            we fight together!

 - Ganon eventually takes enough damage so as to collapse.

Zelda      Link! The Master Sword is here! Hurry up!!

            Use the Master Sword! Destroy Ganon with the sacred sword!

 - Link reclaims the Master Sword and resumes combat with Ganon.
    Upon Ganon's next collapse, Zelda strikes him with magic.

Zelda      I'm using my power to hold the Evil King! You use your sword and
            deliver the final blow!

 - The Master Sword's blade glows momentarily.

Zelda      Use the Master Sword! Destroy Ganon with the sacred sword!

 - Link drives the Master Sword through Ganon's throat.

Zelda      Six Sages... Now!!

 - In the Chamber of the Sages

Rauru      Ancient Creators of Hyrule! Now, open the sealed door and send the
            Evil Incarnation of Darkness into the void of the Evil Realm!!

 - The Sages become spheres of light and merge together, forming a portal
    that consumes Ganondorf and drops him into an abyss.

Ganondorf  YOU... CURSE YOU...ZELDA! CURSE YOU...SAGES!! CURSE YOU...LINK!

            Someday... When this seal is broken... That is when I will
            exterminate your descendants!!

            As long as the Triforce of Power is in my hand...

 - Link and Zelda appear as if to be standing in a sky.

Zelda      Thank you, Link... Thanks to you, Ganondorf has been sealed inside
            the Evil Realm! Thus, peace will once again reign in this world...
            for a time.

            All the tragedy that has befallen Hyrule was my doing... I was so
            young...I could not comprehend the consequences of trying to control
            the Sacred Realm. I dragged you into it, too.

            Now it is time for me to make up for my mistakes... You must lay
            the Master Sword to rest and close the Door of Time... However,
            by doing this, the road between times will be closed...

            Link, give the Ocarina to me... As a Sage, I can return you to
            your original time with it.

            When peace returns to Hyrule... It will be time for us to say
            good-bye...

            Now, go home, Link! Regain your lost time! Home... Where you are
            supposed to be...the way you are supposed to be...

 - A circle of light surrounds Link as Zelda plays the Song of Time.

Zelda      Thank you... Link... Good-bye....

 - The credits begin to roll as various places are displayed. Many of Hyrule's
    inhabitants perform a celebration in Lon Lon Ranch, which the Sages observe
    from Death Mountain.

    Link appears in the Temple of Time as a child, with the Master Sword
    returned to the Pedestal of Time. Navi departs through a window.

    Link enters the courtyard of Hyrule Castle, seemingly unaccompanied by Navi.
    Zelda, who had been looking into a window, turns to Link.

   Navi            


001  The Great Deku Tree has summoned you! Please come with me!

002  C'mon! Be brave! Let's go into the Great Deku Tree!

003  The Great Deku Tree wanted us to go visit the princess at Hyrule Castle...
      Shouldn't we get going?

004  The girl from the ranch asked us to find her father...I wonder where he
      is?

005  I wonder where we'll find the princess in this big old castle?

006  What would Saria say if we told her we're going to save Hyrule?

007  Impa said that the Spiritual Stone of Fire is somewhere on Death Mountain.

008  Let's go inside the Dodongo's Cavern using a Bomb Flower!

009  Darunia said that a fairy lives on top of Death Mountain, didn't he?

010  I wonder if Saria knows anything about the other Spiritual Stone?

011  It seems Princess Ruto somehow got inside Jabu-Jabu's belly...

012  You collected three Spiritual Stones! Let's go back to Hyrule Castle!

013  Those people on the white horse...they were Zelda and Impa, weren't they?
      It looked like they threw something into the moat!

014  Let's go check inside the Temple of Time.

015  Link... Try to keep moving!!

016  Should we believe what Sheik said and go to Kakariko Village?

017  I wonder what's going on in the forest right now... I'm worried about
      Saria, too!

018  That cloud over Death Mountain...there is something strange about it...

019  An arctic wind is blowing from Zora's River...do you feel it?

020  Those Iron Boots look like they weight a ton! If you wear those boots,
      you may be able to walk at the bottom of a lake.

021  Let's look for someone who might know something about the other Sages!

022  Have you ever played the Nocturne of Shadow that Sheik taught you?

023  The desert...that is where Ganondorf the Evil King was born. If we go
      there, we might find something...

024  The one who is waiting for us at the Temple of Time...it could be...

025  We have to save Princess Zelda from her imprisonment in Ganon's Castle!

   [ General ]
001  What's that?

002  You need a key to open a door that is locked and chained.

003  Hey... Isn't that the same design that's on the Door of Time?

004  Strong iron bars are blocking the door. You can't open them with your
      hands!

005  You need a special key to open this door.

006  There's a treasure chest here.

007  It looks like that torch was burning not too long ago...

008  Watch for the shadows of monsters that hang from the ceiling.

   [ Inside the Deku Tree ]
009  Look, look, Link! You can see down below this web using {C Up}!

010  Look at this wall! The vines growing on it give it a rough surface...
      Maybe you can climb it, Link!

011  You can open a door by standing in front of it and pressing {A}.
      Pay attention to what the Action Icon says. That's the blue icon at
      the top of the screen!

012  Look! Something is hanging up there! It looks like an old ladder!

013  After you get into the water, if you hold down {A}. you can dive!
      I bet there are some interesting things underwater!

014  Stand next to this block and grab hold of it with {A}. While holding {A},
      you can push or pull it. If you stand next to the block and press {A}
      while pressing {Control Stick} towards the block, you can climb on top
      of it. Pay attention to what the Action Icon says!

   [ Dodongo's Cavern ]
015  It looks like there are many lava pits around here, so watch your step!

016  Wow! Look at all those Bomb Flowers! Is there any way you can set them
      off all at once?

017  You never know what will be around the corner in these narrow paths...
      Use {Z} Targeting to always look in the proper direction. This is a
      useful technique, isn't it?

018  With that switch on, the moving platform goes higher. Now you can quickly
      reach the second floor!

   [ Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly ]
019  Something strange is covering the entrance. You must solve the puzzle in
      this room to make the entrance open.

020  Watch out, Link! Electricity is running through this <red/blue/green>
      slimy thing!

021  This switch... It doesn't look like you can press it down with your
      weight alone. Link...

022  The red slimy thing is gone! That must be because you cut the red tail!
      Will that work with the other ones too?

023  There's a switch beyond this wall!

   [ Lost Woods ]
024  From here on, we'll be going through some narrow passages! If you take it
      slow, maybe you can sneak up on some enemies. Use {Z} Targeting to always
      look in the proper direction. Set your view so you can see down the next
      corridor before you turn a corner. Once your view is set, hold down {Z}
      to sidestep around the corner. That way you won't be surprised by an enemy
      waiting in ambush.

   [ Forest Temple ]
025  There are arrows painted on the floor!

026  The fires on the torches are gone. Seems like the ghosts took them away!

027  This corridor is all twisted!

028  This...this is the same torch we saw at the entrance to the temple,
      isn't it?

029  This torch is lit...that means...

030  Look, Link! A torch is lit! That's because you beat a ghost, isn't it?!

031  Link, watch out! The ceiling is falling down!

032  This switch is frozen!

   [ Fire Temple ]
033  Link, I hear Goron voices down below.

034  This switch looks rusted.

035  You can see down from here... Isn't that the room where we saw Darunia?

   [ Ice Cavern ]
036  This blue fire...it doesn't seem natural. Maybe you can use it for
      something?

   [ Water Temple ]
037  Link! Be careful! Don't get swallowed by the vortexes!

   [ Bottom of the Well ]
038  I can hear the spirits whispering in this room... "Look for the eye
      of truth..." That's what they are saying!

039  This wall...it says something here... "Danger below..."
      That's what it says.

040  This wall...it says something here... "Danger above..."
      That's what it says.

041  The water flowing out of this statue is flooding the entire floor.

   [ Shadow Temple ]
042  Here...I can hear the spirits whispering in this room... "Those who have
      sacred feet should let the wind guide them. Then, they will be led to the
      secret path." That's what they are saying!

043  This wall...it's saying something! It says If you want to see a ferry
      to the other world, come here...

044  Link! This ship is sinking! Abandon ship! Get onto a safe platform!

       Saria's Song        

Navi       You want to talk to Saria, right?


     -(Talk to Saria)
 - Saria says something.

Navi       Do you want to talk to Saria again?

 - "Yes" prompts Saria to repeat herself. Nothing is said in response to "No".

     -(No)
Navi       Really? Then do you want to talk to me?

 - Nothing is said in response to "No". "Yes" prompts Navi to say something
    from "Story" in 03'02.



      Link...? This is Saria. Can you hear me?

001  I don't mind talking to you using the Ocarina's magic, but I'd really
      like to talk to you face-to-face!

002  The forest is connected to many places! If you can hear my song, you must
      be somewhere that is connected to the forest!

003  I was so happy to hear that Mr. Darunia loved my song so much! I was even
      happier to find out that it helped you on your quest, Link! Tee hee hee!

004  Are you collecting Spiritual Stones? You have one more to find? You mean
      the Spiritual Stone of Water, don't you? The Great Deku Tree once told me
      that Kind Zora, ruler of Zora's Domain, has it...

005  Link... I don't know what it is... I have this feeling of dread...
      The Castle... Yes, something bad is happening at the Castle!

006  What? Your ocarina sounds...different somehow... Have you been practicing
      a lot, Link?

007  Great! You're safe! I knew I would hear from you again! I'm in the Forest
      Temple! The forest spirits were calling for help, so I went to check it
      out... But it's full of evil monsters! Help me, Link!

008  Link... At first, I didn't want to become the Sage of the Forest....
      But I'm glad now. Because I am helping you to save Hyrule, Link!
      Yes, I am!

 - Hyrule Field

    A man runs about Hyrule Field after each Spiritual Stone has been acquired.

RunningMan In old times, I heard there were many wild rabbits in the land of
            Hyrule. Not anymore, though, because of excessive hunting.

            I want to become a rabbit... Listen to the wind with those ears,
            hop across the ground with those legs... Even if I can only pretend.

 - When wearing the Bunny Hood

RunningMan I bet with those long ears you can hear the voices... Oh, these are
            genuine rabbit ears from the animal of legend! I don't care how
            expensive it is! Please sell it to me!

            
                 -
            My long time dream! Returning to the wild life! Finally, the actor,
            stage and prop have been united!

                 -(No way)
            That's not the answer I wanted to hear!
          
     It's a 50-Rupee mask, but he paid you a crazy amount of money for
            it--more money than you can count! Go back to the Mask Shop and
            pay back just 50 Rupees of this money.

RunningMan I bet nobody is faster than I am now! But, I don't know if I should
            be happy or sad...

  Completion  

Owner      Oh, great! You sold it! Please pay back 50 Rupees for the Bunny Hood

            over Hyrule make perfect breeding ground for bugs.

            an ancient Sage.

            but its character is rather lighthearted.

[007]      They say that it's possible to find a total of 100 Gold Skulltulas
            throughout Hyrule.

            and aims to conquer all of Hyrule!

 - In the Forest Stage, upon donning a mask, several Deku Scrubs appear
    from the ground.

    KGZ They fire nuts at Link. The battle theme plays,
    S   They swarm around Link, without attacking. Saria's Song plays.
    s   They dance in circles. The shop theme plays.
    Bg  They produce Rupees. The Hyrule Castle interior's theme plays.
    T   They look between Link and the large Deku. The music does not change.

Large Deku{~~~}    - Nothing.

           {g  } What a big head you have!

           {T  } Well...I can't think of anything funny to say...sorry, kid!

[028]     {KB } Hey, kid, don't grow up to be like me...

           {~~~} Ohhhh...I see... It's an illusion.

           {g  } AAAAAAAAAAAH! A GERUDO!!!! Wha-? A mask? Why do you have a mask
                 like that?!

           {T  } Sorry, I'm busy right now.

[029]     {KsZ} Well...I can't think of anything funny to say...sorry, kid!

           {SBg} Oh, don't do that! I'm shy...

           {G  } What a big head you have!

           {T  } Is there a mask competition going on? I'm going to vote
                 for you!

[031]     {KBg} Hrrrrm... I don't know what to say.

           {SZ } WHOA! My heart...started to beat so fast!

           {sT } That's an unpleasant mask... Good-bye.

           {G  } You shouldn't be so picky about what you eat! Do you eat all
                 your green rocks? If you don't, you won't grow up big and
                 strong!

Group A   {~~~} Oh, that's the mask everyone is talking about! Looks kind of
                 strange...

           {BgT} Hmm, well, I don't really know what to say about that one...

Group B   {~~~} Please quit playing around and dispel our curse!

           {S  } If I wore something like that...I'd be a real Skulltula...
                 AAAAAAAAAAH!

           {Gg } Please understand if I don't laugh... It's hard to be happy
                 in this condition... Being cursed and all...

           {T  } Hyaaaaah! That's scary! I know I'm scary, but...man!
                 That's really scary!

Group C   {~~~} EEEEEAAAAH! Whoops, I shouldn't scream like that or the boss
                 will yell at me!

           {S  } Oh, that's not you, boss?

           {g  } Gerudos are beautiful and brave...They are just so fascinating!

           {T  } Someday, when I have more skill, I'll carve a mask like that
                 one!

Guard     {~~~} Wa-ha-hah! How's business, Mr. Hero? Hah hah hah!

Crptr Son {KBg} I really am a good man. Don't you believe me?

           {S  } I'm not afraid of any forest monsters! Are you trying to
                 make fun of me?

           {sZT} WHAAAA--! I thought you were that old hag! Don't scare me
                 like that!

           {G  } I remember my father talking about a swordsmith...but that
                 doesn't really matter to me anyway.

Sabooru   {~~~} EEEEEAAAAH! Whoops, I shouldn't scream like that or the boss
                 will yell at me!

           {Sg } Someday, when I have more skill, I'll carve a mask like that
                 one!

Shiro     {~~~} EEEEEAAAAH! Whoops, I shouldn't scream like that or the boss
                 will yell at me!

           {Sg } Oh, sorry boss! I didn't mean to slack off! I'll get busy!
                 Oh, that's not you, boss?

           {s  } Someday, when I have more skill, I'll carve a mask like that
                 one!

[008]     {KBG} Oh wow! Cute! But Cuccos are much cuter!

           {Sg } I'm sorry, I'm not really interested in that.

           {s  } The little kid playing in the graveyard was saying something
                 about his face...

           {ZT } Eh, what? Are you sad? Happy? I can't really tell...

[009]     {Ks } You idiot! When you talk to someone, you should take off
                 your mask!

           {Sg } You idiot! When you talk to someone, you shouldn't stare!

           {BT } You idiot! I don't know why I'm calling you that, but...
                 you are one!

           {GZ } You idiot! When you talk to someone, you should make eye
                 contact!

[010]     {K  } I don't care about any foxes!

           {Ssg} That's irritating! It bothers my eyes!

           {BG } That looks quite handsome!

           {ZT } Waaaaaaah! What is wrong with you? Do you have a bad attitude?

[020]     {Ks } Where did you get that? What? It's a mask?

           {SB } A mask is just like a musical instrument--it reflects the
                 character of its owner. I like your originality, kid!

           {GT } What a big head! How'd you fit through that door?!

           {Zg } Uh, leave me alone... Can't you see I'm in a groove right now?

[021]     {K  } Hey! It's a Keaton Mask!! I asked my daddy to get me one, too!

           {~~~} That's not very different from Mr. Dampï¿½, is it?

           {s  } That doesn't look anything like Mr. Dampï¿½, huh?

           {B  } What is that? It's something that hops around in a field...
                 I forgot what those things are called...

Dampï¿½     {KB } Huh?! Wha--! Oh, it's just a kid. Don't scare me like that!
                 I may not look like it, but I'm a very sensitive guy!

           {SZG} I'm on duty now... If you want me to dig, don't bother me.

           {s  } Do you know what kind of mask you're wearing...?
                 And you're still wearing it?

           {GT } Well, will you lookit the noggin on this kid! It's HUGE!

           {G  } You shouldn't be so picky about what you eat! Do you eat all

                 strong!

           {Z  } WHOA! My heart...started to beat so fast!

           {Z  } Yeah, right. You look a little small for a Zora...

           {g  } Red hair...tan skin... I've seen people like that before...

Ruto      {KSg} You're a funny guy!

           {sGT} Your head--it's gigantic!

           {B  } Don't do that... It's embarrassing me!

           {Z  } All right You actually decided to become a Zora!
                 Are you actually ready to marry me now?

King Zora {~~~} Ho ho ho! You Hylians...you are such silly creatures!

           {sg } That face...it gives me the chills...

           {G  } Talk about a nostalgia trip! That reminds me of my childhood

 [03'06] ---       Biggoron's Sword      

  Kakariko Village 

[KA-008]   I bred a new type of miniature Cucco! I call it the Pocket Cucco!
            I don't get goose bumps from this baby.

            Cuccos are very good at getting lazy, late-risers out of bed.
            Haven't you heard of them before? It makes them very happy to crow
            CUCCKOOOO! especially when it wakes up a very heavy sleeper!

            However, my Cucco is not entirely happy right now... You..., [sic]
            You look like you're good at handling Cuccos. Here, take this egg.
            After the Cucco hatches, bring it back to me after a while,
            and I'll check out its mood.

            What do you think? Will you try?

     -
     You borrowed a Pocket Egg! A Pocket Cucco will hatch from it
            overnight. Be sure to give it back when you are done with it.

[KA-008]   Please make my Cucco happy! OK?

     -(No)
[KA-008]   Oh, too bad...were you pecked by a Cucco when you were little?


 - At the next morning

Navi       Look! A chicken hatched from the egg you were incubating!
            It's the miracle of life!

 - Talon is sleeping in a certain house. The Cucco can awaken him.

Talon      What in tarnation? Can't a person get a little shut-eye around here?

            Ingo took over Lon Lon Ranch and they call it Ingo Ranch nowadays.
            I was kicked out of there, and look at me now! My girl, Malon,
            still works at the ranch... I'm worried about her...

               - After having acquired Epona

            Did you save Malon? Thanks! I'm goin' back to the ranch, then!
            Yeehah!

 - After the above

[KA-010]   That bearded guy went back to the ranch. He looked so happy!

[CT-011]   That lazy man, he kind of reminded me of my little Richard...
            What's that? You say you've never heard of my little Richard?
            He was such a famous puppy! You seriously haven't heard of him?

[KA-008]   Oh, your Cucco looks pretty happy! He must have awakened an
            extremely lazy guy!

            You're a good Cucco Keeper! I'll give you a rare, valuable Cucco,
            if you're interested... Its name is Cojiro, and it used to be my
            brother's Cucco. Its blue body is quite charming. It's so cute!

            Since my brother has gone, it's strange, but Cojiro has stopped
            crowing. Do you want to keep Cojiro?


     -
     You returned the Pocket Cucco and got Cojiro in return! Unlike other
            Cuccos, Cojiro rarely crows.

[KA-008]   My brother must have been very lonely...

     -(No)
[KA-008]   It looks as if you really like that other Cucco. OK, you can keep it
            for a while.


 Lost Woods  

 - The carpenter boss's son is present in Area 03.

Navi       ?? No response. He's sleeping.

 - Upon presenting Cojiro, it crows, thereby catching the man's attention.

Crptr Son  Cojiro?  Why? Normally only a nice guy like me can tame you...
            Which means... You... You must be a nice guy! Must be! You must be!!
            Please Mr. Nice Guy! Please! Deliver this stuff to the old hag
            in the potion shop in Kakariko Village! This will disappear if you
            take too long, so you gotta hurry!


     -(OK)
     You got an Odd Mushroom! A fresh mushroom like this is sure to
            spoil quickly! Take it to the Kakariko Potion Shop, quickly!

Crptr Son  Hurry up, nice guy! Before it disappears, deliver it to that old
            wench....

     -(I can't)
Crptr Son  Oh, yeah. That's it! You aren't a nice guy after all!! Get away
            from me!


 - If the mushroom expires

Navi       Oh, no! Time's up! The thing you were going to deliver has spoiled!
            Let's try again!

  Kakariko Village

Granny     Sniff sniff sniff... What a mysterious smell... You must have
            something!

            That bum! He had to go into the forest... ....I see. Hey, give it
            to me now!


     -
Granny     If you see that fool, give this to him. It is the strongest medicine
            I have ever produced. However, this potion will not work on a
            monster...

     You received an Odd Potion! You don't know what's going on between
            this lady and that guy, but take it to the Lost Woods!

Granny     They say that there is no medicine that can cure a fool...
            I guess that's true...

     -(No)
Granny     How sad... I just need a little...


 - Subsequently

Granny     Ultimate potion! How about 100 Rupees?

            
                 -(Buy)
               - She provides a Blue Potion. If problems arise

            You don't have enough Rupees! Hee hee hee!

            I'm sorry...I can't sell this to you unless you have a bottle to
            put it in.

                 -(Don't buy)
            If you change your mind, come back and visit me... Hee hee hee!
            

 Lost Woods  

 - The carpenter boss's son is absent. [008] of Kokiri Forest is present.

[008]      That guy isn't here anymore. Anybody who comes into the forest
          
  will be lost. Everybody will become a Stalfos. Everybody, Stalfos.
            So, he's not here anymore.

 - If the Odd Potion is presented, then she continues

[008]      Only is saw is left. Hee hee. That medicine is made of forest
            mushrooms. Give it back!


     -
     You returned the Odd Potion and got the Poacher's Saw!
            The young punk guy must have left this behind.

[008]      Heh heh heh. Are you going to be... too? Heh heh!

     -(No)
 - Nothing more is said.


  Gerudo Valley  

Crptr Boss Hey, that saw! It's mine! But... I thought I left that saw with my
            old lady... Oh well...

            My Biggoron tool broke, so I was going to Goron city to get it
            repaired. Your coming here is great timing. Will you give me my saw?


     -
Crptr Boss Good kid! Thanks! I'm sorry that I can't give you something as good
            in return, but...take this anyway!

     You traded the Poacher's Saw for a Broken Goron's Sword!
            Visit Biggoron to get it repaired!

     -(No)
Crptr Boss What?! You're a dirty, rotten thief!


  Death Mountain Trail  

 - Biggoron is rubbing his eyes. Upon presenting the Broken Biggoron's Sword

Biggoron   That broken knife is surely my worrrrrrrrrrk... I really want to
            repairrrrr it, but... But because of yesterrrrrday's errrrruption,
            my eyes are irrrrrrrritated...

            There are fine eyedrops in Zora's Domain... You will find them
            if you go to see Kinnnnnng Zorrrrrra... Please go get the
            eyedrrrrrrops...


     -
     You checked in the Broken Goron's Sword and received a Prescription!
            Go see King Zora!

Biggoron   I've been waiting forrrrr you, with tearrrrrrs in my eyes...
            Please say hello to Kinnng Zorrra!

     -(No)
Biggoron   Awww nooooo... I'm finished... My eyes arrrrrre so itchy...
            Owwwwww...


  Zora's Domain  

King Zora  Ooh... This is... well... hmmm... Hmmm... Eye drops... You might say
            we have them, you might say we don't... We do have the ingredients.
            If you take the ingredients to the doctor at the lake laboratory,
            he can make the drops for you. But you need to deliver them fresh...

            Can you make it before they spoil?


     -
     You used the Prescription and received an Eyeball Frog! Be quick
            and deliver it to Lake Hylia while it's cold!

     -(No)
King Zora  Then you think they'll spoil before you can get there? It's not that
            far if you make the connection on horseback...


  Lake Hylia  

[002]      Oh, wow! I haven't seen an Eyeball Frog like this since Zora's
            Domain froze over! These eyeballs are so delicious! Tonight I will
            cook fried eyeballs for the first time in a long time! Uhoy hoy
            hoo houy hoy! Such great stuff! Please say thank you to King Zora!

            Eh? What? These are for making Biggoron's Eye Drops? Oh, how
            disappointing! You should have said so in the first place!

            Here it is. This medicine doesn't have any preservatives in it.
            So it won't last long at this temperature. Run as fast as you can
            to Death Mountain. You're young--you can do it!

     You traded the Eyeball Frog for the World's Finest Eye Drops!
            Hurry! Take them to Biggoron before they go bad!

[002]      When you come back next time, don't forget to bring me a souvenir!

  Death Mountain Trail  

Biggoron   Rrrrreally? You brrrrought the eye drops? I'm so rrrrrelieved!
            I'm going to use them rrrrrright now!

            Wowwwwwwwwwwwwww!! This is stimulating! It's worrrrrking grrrrreat!
            Now I can get back to my blade business! My worrrrrk is not verrry
            consistent, so I'll give this to you so you won't forrrrget.

            Afterrrr a few days... Please returrrrrrn... Wait, just wait
            patiently...

     The Biggoron's Sword... You got a Claim Check for it! You can't wait
            for the sword to be completed!

Biggoron   Not yet... Hey you... You arrrre impatient...

 - On the third day from  the acquisiton of the Claim Check

Biggoron   I maaaade thissss... Trrrrade for claimmm checkkk...

 - Upon presenting the Claim Check

Biggoron   That sworrrrd is my finest worrrrk!

     You handed in the Claim Check and got the Biggoron's Sword!
            This blade was forged by a master smith and won't break!

 - When speaking to him again, he repeats "That sworrrrd is my finest worrrrk!"

    Link retains the Claim Check. Upon presenting it to Biggoron

Biggoron   I giiiive thissss to yoooou forrr a souvenirrrrr.
