Harry Potter and the Wizard/Wizard Stone
Chapter 1
scene:

There’s a neighborhood on a street called Private Drive. An owl, sitting in the street, flies over to point at an old man walking in a bush near the street. It stops at the base of the system and removes a mechanical part and removes all light from the laser. He stops the machine and pets a cat. The man, Albert Dumbledore, watches the cat, Tabby, sitting on a brick.


Dumbledore: I should have known you'd be here...Professor McGonagall.


The cat sniffs at May and the camera pans to the wall. The cat’s shadow transforms into a person. There are footprints and MINERVA MCGONAGALL appears.


McGonagall: Good night, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumors true, Albert?


Dumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good and the bad.

McGonagall: And the baby?

Dumbledore: Hagrid's coming for him.

McGonagall: Do you think it's wise to trust Hagrid with anything important?

Albert: Ah, Professor, I trust Hagrid with my life.


There’s the sound of an engine, and the two professors look up to see an explosion of engines coming down from the atmosphere. He walks down the road and stops. An older man, RUBEUS HAGRID, takes off his glasses.


Hagrid: Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall.

Dumbledore: No problem, I'm sure, Hagrid?

Hagrid: No, man. Little Tiki fell asleep while we were flying over Bristol. Hey. Try to wake him up. There you go.


Hagrid gives Dumbledore a baby in the graveyard.


McGonagall: Albus, do you think she's safe, staying with these people? I watched them all day. They are the worst people imaginable. They are right.

Dumbledore: The only family he has.


They stand in a house.


McGonagall: This kid is going to be recognized. There is hardly a child in our world who does not know his name.

Dumbledore: Exactly. It’s better for her to grow up and get away from all of this. Until it's ready.



Hagrid coughs and sniffles as he cries. He clears his throat.


Dumbledore: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really all languages.


Hagrid turned his head. Dumbledore picked up a letter and placed it on the boy, who was now in the doorway. The child has visible blood on his forehead that looks like a soot.



Dumbledore: Good luck...Harry Potter.


The camera pans to Jolly to reveal the opening theme:

Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone


About ten years later: DURSLEY HOUSE. The camera pans to a sleeping boy, about eleven years old, with a scar on his forehead the size of a chandelier.

There is a twist and a gasp. Outside, a tall woman, Petunia’s heart, knocks on the door.


Petunia: Upstairs. get up. {Knock} {Sigh} Now! {Knocks on the door of the library which is the boys room}


A large boy, Dudley Dursley, suddenly ran down the stairs above the box. He stops halfway back and jumps up the stairs.



Dudley: Wake up, aunt! We're going to the animal!


Dudley laughed and ran down the stairs to the kitchen. The boy, HARRY POTTER, tries to get out of the book, but Duddy catches him.


Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley went.


Peyton: Oh, he's coming here, birthday baby!


A big, bulky man, VERNON DURSLEY, is sitting at the kitchen table.


Vernon: Happy birthday, baby.


Petunia and Dudley laughed together. Harry walked into the kitchen, dressed in robes.


Peyton: Why don't you just cook breakfast, and make sure you don't burn anything.

Harry: Yes, Aunt Pettine.



It starts working.



Peyton: I want everything to look perfect on my duddy’s special day.

Vernon: Hurry up! Bring on my coffee man!

Harry: Yes, Uncle Vernon.


Petunia leads Dudley into the family room, where there are many presents. Dudley stares.


Duddy: How many people are there?

Vernon: Thirty-six. I counted them myself.

Dudley: Thirty-six?! But last year I got thirty-seven!!

Vernon: Yeah, well, some of them are a little bigger than last year!

Dudley: I don't care how big they are!

Peyton: Oh, now, now, now. That’s what we’re going to do, and when we’re out we’re going to buy you two new gifts! How's that for an apple?


scene:

Outside, morning. The happy family goes to the car. Harry went to go in but Vernon stopped him.



Peyton: This is going to be a good day for the animal. I’m looking forward to it.

Vernon: I'm warning you now, sir. Funny business, everything, and you don’t get food for a week. Enter.



scene:

Animals. The family is in Retaliation's house, watching a giant BOA CONSTRICTOR.


Dudley: Make it move.

Vernon banged on the glass of the cage.


Vernon: Move!


Dudley pounded harder on the glass and Vernon frowned.


Dudley: Move!

Harry: He's sleeping!

Dudley: It sucks.



Dudley and his parents retreat to another wall. Harry stayed with the snake.



Harry: I'm sorry about that. He doesn’t understand what it’s like, to lie there every day and have people’s disgusted faces rub on you.



The snake raises an eyebrow and blinks.


Harry: Do you...hear me? {The snake nods} That's right...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you…I mean…do you talk to people often? {Snake shakes his head} Are you from Burma? Was it fun there, and did you have your family? {Snake turns his head to a sign that says: Bred in Captivity} There I am. I see that too. I never knew my parents either.


The now awake snake catches Dudley's attention. He walked into the cage and knocked Harry to the ground.


Dudley: Mom, Dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake does!!



Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. Harry, from the ground, looked at her. Suddenly, the mirror disappears. Dudley is in front.



Dudley: Wow! Ahhh! Ah!!


Dudley fell through the snake's gap and vomited into a pool of water. The snake came out of the display and stood in front of Harry.


SA: Thank you.

Harry: Anytime.



The snake begins.


Man: Dead!


There are many screams as the snake goes free. Dudley gets up and leaves, but the mirror is back up on the wall. It’s stuck. He hits the glass.


Duddy: Mommy, Mommy!

Peyton: {sees it} AHH!

Duddy: Help Mom! Help me!

Peyton: Dear son! How did you get in there?!

Harry: {laughs and smiles}


Vernon glared at him and Harry's smile disappeared. Peyton is screaming: How did you get in there? The Dursleys, oh, the Dursleys!



scene:

We went back to the Dursley's. Petunia and Dudley entered.

Peyton: Right. It’s all good.



They disappear around the corner. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slammed the door and slammed Harry against the wall, grabbing his hair.



Harry: Oh!

Vernot: What happened?

Harry: I swear, I don't know! One minute there was a lion and then there it was! It was like magic!

Vernon: {chuckles and punches Harry in the box} No magic items!



scene:

Outside, moments later. The owl flies near the house and drops a letter, which extends the mailbox. It lands far away in the house and screams.

Harry, inside, goes to get the letter. She shuffles the letters and goes to look at the letters addressed to her. She went into the kitchen and handed the rest of the message to Vernon, walking across the table to see his message.


Vernon: Oh, Marge is sick. He ate something funny.

Dodd: {Looking at Harry's letter. He ran to catch it} mother, look! Harry has a letter!!

Harry: Hey, give it! Just for me!

Warrior: {laughs} Yours? Who is going to write to you?


The family gathers to explore the neighborhood. The letter has a broken seal. The family looks up and Harry sighs.


scene:

Another owl flies in with the letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabbed a few letters and shredded them.

In the room, Harry heard a noise. He watches Vernon lock the wood on the letterbox opening.



Vernon: No messages through this mailbox.



scene:

Outside, Vernon and Petunia appear. Vernon wants to go to work. Petunia kissed his cheek.


Peyton: Have a great day at the office, dear.



He stops, looks around, and sees a flock of owls.


Vernon: Shuh! Go!


scene:

in. Vernon throws the letters into the fireplace. Harry came around the corner. Vernon grins wickedly and throws more.


scene:

Home/family room. The family sits down and Harry serves cookies.



Vernon: Sundays are good. It’s the best day of the week, in my opinion. Why is that, Duddy?


Dudley shrugged.


Harry: {Hands cookie to Vernon} Because there's no post office on Sunday? Ahhh, you're right, Harry. No message Caroline haha! No explosive messages today. No man. {Harry saw a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are standing.} No man, one didn't breathe, miserable---


A letter comes out of the fireplace and splashes in Vernon's face. There’s a noise and more letters come out of the fireplace.


Dudley: Ahh! Stop it! Please stop! {Jumps on Peyton's lap}

Petunia and Vernon: Scream.

Vernon: Go there, oh!

Duddy: What's that? I wonder what's going on!


Harry hopped onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He finds one and runs off. Vernon jumped in too.


Vernon: Give it to me! Give me that letter!



He chases and grabs Harry before Harry can enter his closet.


Harry: Down! Ahhh!

Vernon: Ahh!

Harry: Those are my letters! Get me out!

Vernon: That's right! We're going! ! Where they can’t find us!

Dudley: Father's mad, isn't he?!


scene:

A house on a rock on a hill by the sea. The family sleeps, Harry on the cold, muddy ground. He draws a birthday cake that says Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's clock, which chimes 12:00.



Harry: Make a wish, Harry. {Wind}


Suddenly there was a knock on the door. Harry jumps. The door knocked again and Dudley and Harry jumped back. Petunia appears with Vernon, Vernon with the gun. There was another knock on the door and it opened, revealing a young man.


Vernon: Who's there? Ahhh!

Hagrid: Sorry about that. {She pushes back the door}

Vernon: I’m asking you to leave now, sir! Break in and get in!

Peyton: Oh.


Hagrid came over and took the gun and bent it upwards.


Hagrid: Dry up, Dursleys, you big fruit. {picks up a gun}

Everyone: Ahhh!

Hagar: {sees Dudley} Honey, I haven't seen you since you were a kid, Harry, but you're a little longer than I expected. Especially in the 'middle!

Dudley: I'm not Harry.

Harry leaves: II am.

Hagrid: Oh, yes, of course you are! I got something for you. 'I'm afraid I might have to sit on it at some point! I imagine it tastes better that way. Ahhh. I cooked it myself. {Blowing Harry's cake} words and all. Hey.

Harry: Thank you! {Opening the cake, it reads: Happy Bride Harry.}

Hagrid: Your eleven-year-old boy isn't eleven any day, is he?



Hagrid sat down on the couch and pulled out an umbrella and stared at the empty fire. Poof poof! Two flames fly and a fire begins. The family turns a blind eye.



Harry: {puts the cake down} Hello, who are you?

Hagrid: Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of the Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. Of course, you’ll learn all about Hogwarts.

Harry: I'm sorry.

Hagrid: No? Blyme, Harry, didn’t you ask where your mother and father learned it all?

Harry: What did you learn?

Hagrid: You're a wizard, Harry.

Harry: Me what?

Harry: A witch. And good good, so I'm busy. If you practice a little.

Harry: No, you're mistaken. I can't be a...aa demon. I mean, it’s just… Harry. Just Harry.

Hagrid: Well, just Harry, did you do something? Anything you couldn’t explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry shrugs} Ah.

Dudley: {whispering}



Hagrid gives Harry the same message that was sent last time. Harry opened his mouth.



Harry: Mother Potter. We are pleased to announce that you have been accepted into Hogwarts School of Magic!

Vernon: Hell no go! We swore when we got to wed we would end this crap!

Harry: Did you know?? You always knew and never told me?

Peyton: Of course we knew. How can you not be? What a wonderful sister. Oh, my mom and dad were so proud when she got her letter. We have magic in the family. Isn’t it amazing? I was the only one who saw it for what it was. Madness! And then he saw that poster, and then he found you, and I knew you were going to be the same, like weird, like… weird. And then, if you will, she went and fucked herself! And we stand with you.

Harry: Exploded? You told me my parents died in a car accident!

Hagrid: Car crash? A car accident killed James and Lily Potter?

Peyton: We had to tell her something.

Hagrid: That's a pain! That’s a shame!

Vernon: He's not going!

Hagrid: Oh, and I suppose someone as powerful as you is going to stop it?

Harry: Mogle?

Hagrid: Not a magician. This boy has a name since he was born! He goes to the best school of magic and wizardry in the world, and he becomes under one of the most powerful headmasters Hogwarts has ever seen: Albert Dumbledore.

Vernon: I'm not going to pay some old idiot to teach her magic tricks!

Hagrid: {whips the umbrella to show it to Vernon} Don't you ever taste Albus Dumbledore in front of me.



Hagrid saw Dudley eating Harry's cake and pointed to the umbrella behind him. The gray tail grows.



Dudley: Ahh!

Everyone: Ahhh! {Family hits Duddy}

Harry: {laughs}

Hagrid: Oh, um, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts. To be honest, I don’t have to react.

Harry: {Nods} Okay.

Hagrid: {checks a clock} Oh, we're a little behind. It’s good to get out. Unless you want to stay. Hmm? {leave}



Harry smiled and looked back and smiled again.



scene:

Streets of London. Hagrid and Harry walk.

Harry: All pupils should have access to materials… two balls of the same standard size and they can come up with an owl, a cat or a pony if they want. Can we have all this in London?

Hagrid: If you know where you're going.



They go to a store and enter, The Leaky Cauldron.

{Music & Lyrics}



Bark Tom : Ahh, Hagrid! Familiar, I guess?

Hagrid: No thanks, Tom. I’m on Hogwarts business today. I’m here helping young Harry buy his school supplies.

Tom: Strengthen my soul. It’s Harry Potter.



The store is silent. A man came over and took Harry's hand.



Man: Welcome, Mr. Potter, welcome.



A wizard came over and took Harry's hand as well.



Witch: Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm finally like you.



There is a man in black with a cross on his head. It’s a queer teacher.



Quirrell: Harry P-Potter. I can’t tell you how glad I am to have met you.

Hagrid: Thank you, Professor. I didn’t see you there. Harry, this is Professor Queer. He will be your Defensive Dark Arts instructor at Hogwarts.

Harry: Oh, I'd love to know you. {Removes hand. Quirrell refuses}

Quirrell: Very interesting f-word. N-It's not that you need it, E-E, Potter? Hehe.

Hagrid: Yeah, well, he has to go now. More to buy. Hey.

Harry: Together.



The two appear in the back through a window in front of a brick wall.



Hagrid: You see, Harry, you look familiar!

Harry: But why am I called Hagrid? All those people out there, how do they know who I am?

Hagrid: I'm not sure I'm the right person to tell you, Harry. {She presses the brick wall against the clock with her sandals. The hills shift and open to reveal a hidden street with lots of characters.}

Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Street.



Harry smiles widely as they enter the street and walk down it. The owl crows.



Hagrid: This is where you'll find your clubs and your citadel, and all the elements you need to cast your magic.



Harry marveled as they walked past shops, owls and goblins. The camera is on a movie store where a group of boys crowd around a glowing second.



Cher: It’s the world’s largest running shoe. You see, it’s the new Noble 2000! This is the fastest example.

Harry: But, Hagrid, how am I going to pay for all of this? I have no money.

Hagrid: Yes, there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, Wizards Bank. Nowhere would be safer than Hogwarts.



Inside the bank, they walk down the dimly lit road, past the small borders that work.



Harry: Ahhh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?

Hagrid: They're goblins, Harry. Intelligent as they come among goblins, but they are not the most advanced of the animal kingdom. The best stick closest to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with the goblins inside.} Mr. Harry Potter wants to leave.



The goblin looks up.



Goblin: And is there Mr. Harry Potter's quarters?

Hagrid: Ohhh. Wait a minute. I found it here somewhere. Huh. He’s a little devil. Oh, and there’s something else too. Professor Dumbledore gave this to me. It’s all about you-knowing-what-you-know. {Hand Goblin's letter is wrapped in string.}

Goblin: Very well.



scene:

Descending into the depths of the caverns in a wheelbarrow-like structure. The truck stops and a goblin, GRIPHOOK, climbs out.



Griffik: Okay 687. Lamp, please. {Hagrid gives him the lamp and walks to the room} KEY Please. {Hagrid gives him the key to open it}



The room is filled from top to bottom with silver. Harry was surprised.



Hagrid: Didn't you think your mother and father would leave you with nothing?



They continue into the mountain.



Graphic: 713 Wallace.

Harry: What's in there, Hagrid?

Hagrid: I can't tell you, Harry. It’s Hogwarts magic. It’s a secret.

Griffik: Stop. {Puts his finger down on the door. Clank. Clank. The window opens to reveal a small white stone. Hagrid rushed in and picked it up. The evil light that used to shine disappears.}



Hagrid: Better not tell anyone about this, Harry.

Harry shook his head.



Location: Outside on the street, taking a walk.



Harry: I still need...the wand.

Hagrid: Wand? Well, you’re with Oliphander. There is no better place. Run away from there, but be careful. I just found one thing I needed to do. It’s not long.



Harry entered the store in silence. He looks around. There are bars, but no people.



Harry: {humanity} Like? Hello?



There is a tank. A man emerged from the stairs and looked at Harry. She smiles.



Ollivander: I wonder when I'll see you again, Mr. Potter. It seems like just yesterday that your mom and dad were here buying their first candles. {Takes a pick} Ah. We are here. {Harry grabs it but he just stops} Well, give him a wave.

Harry: Oh! {Time. All the trumpets are falling. Harry jumped and quickly placed the bread on the counter.}

Ollivander: Likely not. {Gets another wand.} Probably this one. {Harry looks at a vase of flowers, it swells.} No, no, absolutely not! It didn't really matter...{gets a wand} I'm wondering. {Hands to Harry. Harry glows under it.} Curious, very curious.

Harry: I'm sorry, but what's a quest?

Ollivander: I remember every wand I sold to Mr. Potter. It just so happened that the phoenix with the back feathers on your staff gave out another feather, just one. You loved that stick when his brother gave you this blood. {Building Poets}

Harry: And...who owned that castle?

Oliver: Oh, we won't name him. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It’s not always clear why, but I think it’s clear that we can expect big things from you. After all, the person-whose-name doesn’t speak did great things…bad, yes, but great. {He has Harry on his wand.}



Someone knocks on the window.



Hagrid: Harry! Harry! happy birthday! {There's a snowman in his cage that screeches.}

Harry: Wow.



Where: Later dinner. Both Hagrid and Harry sit at a long table eating soup.



Hagrid: Are you alright, Harry? You seem relaxed.

Harry: Did he kill my parents? who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know, you know.

Hagrid: {sighs and blows fire} First, and you have to understand this, Harry, because it's very important. Not all witches are good, some are bad. A few years ago there was a wizard that went about as bad as you could go. And his name was V-…his name was V-…

Harry: Maybe if you write it down?

Hagrid: No, I can't write it. all right. His name was Voldemort.

Harry: Voldemort?

Hagrid: Liz!!

{Harry looks around}



A memory followed, of a man in a suit walking towards a building, breaking his cane, and then panicking. Hagrid declares.



Hagrid: Those were dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort began to gather some followers and draw them closer to the Dark Side. Anyone who stood in front of him would eventually die. Your parents fought him, but no one survived when he tried to kill them. {Harry's mother, Lily, screams as he kills Voldemort with his wand} No one...no one. Except for you. {Close-up of baby Harry.}

Harry: Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

Hagrid: Yes. It's no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. Such a mark comes from touching a curse…and a terrible curse at that.

Harry: What happened to who-...you-know-who?

Hagrid: Some say he's dead. Codeswalt I think. No, I think he's still there, he's too tired to continue. But one thing is certain. Something about you made him feel better that night. That's why you're named Henry. That’s why everyone knows your name. You’re the man who lived.





Location: London Train Station. Harry (with the wagon and the Gwing) walks alongside Hagrid on a bridge overpass.



A couple looks at Hagrid.



Hagrid: What are you looking at? {Looks at watch} Bloomy, what time is it? I'm sorry, Harry, I'm leaving you. Dumbledore will... well, he'll see me. Now your train leaves every 10 minutes. Here are your tickets. Keep at it, Harry, it's worth it. Book your tickets.



Harry looked at his golden ticket.



Harry: Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. That says 9 ¾ plates. There’s nothing like it…is there? {Harry looked up and saw Hagrid disappear.}



Scene: Harry is walking along the tracks. A man ran past.



Man: I'm sorry.

Harry saw the train conductor.

Harry: Excuse me, please.

Male leader: {addressing woman and child} On your right, mistress.

Harry: I'm sorry, sir. Could you tell me where I can get a 9 ¾ pencil?

Train conductor: 9 ¾? You think you’re being funny, right? {leave}



A woman, her daughter, and four men walk by, holding otter.



Ms. Weiss: It happens every year. Always filled with people, of course.

Harry: People?

Mrs. Weasel: Come on. Platform 9 ¾ through this! Well, Percy, you first.



A tall man with red hair comes and runs towards a brick wall. Amazingly, she disappears into it. Harry was surprised.



Mrs. Weasley: You're coming, Fred.

George: It's not Fred, it's me!

Fred: Really, Miss, you call yourself our mother!

Mrs. Wesley: Oh, I'm sorry, George.

Fred: Just kidding. I'm Fred. {He runs into the wall, followed by his twin brother.}



Harry shook his head incredulously.



Harry: I'm sorry! Can you tell me how

Ms. Wesley: How do I get on the platform? Yes, don’t worry, Mom. This is Ron's first time at Hogwarts as well. {pan to a red haired boy who smiles} Now you have to walk through the wall between 9 and 10 feet.

Jenny (daughter): You're right.



Harry took a deep breath and backed away from the wall. He closes his eyes and out the other side is a beautiful station with a red train and lots of people. A whistle blew and Harry sighed with relief.



Plot: The train is traveling through an unknown country. Jump to the inner area where Harry is sitting. The red-headed man, Ron, comes out and has dirt on his nose.



Ronnie: Excuse me, do you mind? All other spaces are full.

Harry: No, not at all.

Ron: {sitting down in front of Harry} I'm Ron, anyway. Ron Weasley.

Harry: I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

{Ron goes to Agape.}

Ronnie: So-so true?! What I mean by that is...oh...

Harry: What?

Ron: {whispers} Scar...?

Harry: Oh, yeah. {She lifts hair}

Ronnie: Bad.

A glass arrives in the kitchen, filled with sweets.

Woman: Something out of the glass, children?

Ronnie: {grabs sandwich crumbs} No, thanks, I'm all set. {Smacking lips.}

Harry: {pulls out money} We're taking the star!

Ronnie: Wow!



Appearance: Eating sugar bars.

Ron's mouse, Scabber, is sitting on Ron's lap with a box on his head.



Harry: Any flavor of Bertie Bott's beans?

Ron: They mean all flavors! There’s chocolate and plantains, and there’s also spinach, liver, and truffle. George swore he smelled bogey once!



The bean that Harry quickly chewed in his mouth.



Harry: {picks up the blue and gold package} Aren't these chocolate frogs?

Ronnie: It's just dinner. In addition, you provide cards. Each group has a famous magician or wizard. I got about 500 of them myself.

Tori: Pig. {The rabbit flies out the window and bounces around, then flies out the window...and disappears.}

Ronnie: Oh, that's a real opportunity. They only had one good jump in them to begin with.

Harry: Hey, I got Dumbledore!

Ronnie: I got about 6 of them.

Harry: Hey, it's gone!

Ronnie: Well, you can't make sure he's still kicking ass, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, the bastard, pity, isn't it?

Harry: Just a little.

Ronnie: Fred did a shift for me to make it yellow. Want to try?

Harry: Yes!

Ronnie: {clears throat} Ahh. journey-



A girl, HERMIONE GRANGER, with blonde hair, comes through the door.



Hermione : Has anyone seen Tortoise? A boy named Neville lost one.

Ronnie: No.

Hermione: Oh, you do magic? Let's see then.

Ronnie: Aghhmm. Sunshine, greasy, greasy, turn this fat mouse yellow!

{Jap. Nothing will happen. Ron raised his hand.}

Hermione: Are you sure it's a real fever? Well, it’s not very good, is it? Honestly, I just tried a few simple words myself and they all worked for me. For example...{Hermione walks over and sits down in front of Harry. He points to his glasses and Harry frowns} Oculus Reparo. Glasses with a pinched nose have been improved. Harry surprisingly took them off.} Is that any better? Cricket god, you’re Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you're...?

Ronnie: {mouth fills} I'm...Ronnie Weasel.

Hermione: My pleasure. You both better change out of your clothes. I hope we get back soon. {She gets up and leaves, then goes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt up your nose, then, you know? Right there. {Points} {Ron rubs his nose in embarrassment.}



Scene: In the dark, a train blows its whistle and pulls into an outdoor station. Hagrid walks down a side street with a flashlight. People start getting off the train.



Hagrid: No, then! The first few years! This time I will! Come now, don’t be shy! Come now, make haste!



Harry and Ron walked over to Hagrid.



Hagrid: Thank you, Harry.

Harry: Hey, Hagrid.

Ronnie: Wow!

Hagrid: Meanwhile. This way to the mountains! Come, follow me.



scene:

A few trails continue past a large waterfall where a large castle can be seen in the foreground. People are afraid.

Ronnie: Bad.



Scene: On the top level, Professor McGonagall is waiting. He taps his fingers on a stone and heads to the top of the stairs to greet the newcomer.



McGonagall: Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, after a few moments, you walk through those doors and join your classmates. But before you take the seats, you need to plan in your rooms. Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now that you’re here, your home will be like your family. Your victories earn you house points. Break any rule, and you lose the point. At the end of the year, the horse with the most points wins the Horse Cup .



NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, a frightened young man watches his wilderness, sitting next to McGoughgal. He jumps forward.



Neville: Trevor! {McGonagall glares at him} Please. {It's in the back.}

McGonagall: The sorting ceremony will begin shortly. {leave}



DRACO MALFOY, one of the bad boys, speaks.



Draco: It's true, then, what they say about the train. Harry Potter came to Hogwarts. {Students whisper, Harry Potter?} This is Corby, and Golla {nods to thugs} and I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. {Ron snickers at his name} Do you think my name is funny? Don't ask yours. Red hair and my blanket? You have to be a visa. You’ll soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go hang out with the wrong person. I can help you there. {Raises hand.}

Harry: I think I can find out who the bad guys are for myself, thank you.



Draco grinned. McGonagall returned and tapped the paper on her shoulder. He follows her with one last eye.



McGonagall: We're ready for you now.



It leads everyone through two main doors to the main stage, where there are four long tables with lots of kids and floating candles. It’s like heaven.



Hermione: Not really, ceiling. It’s as magical as the night sky. I studied it at Hogwarts: History.

McGonagall: Well, you'll wait here, please? Now, before we get started, Professor Durbu would like to say a few words.



Dumbledore rose from the head table.



Dumbledore: I have a few starting points to announce. First Years Please note that black cats are prohibited for all students. And our host, Mr. Fields {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right is off limits to anyone who doesn’t want to die a violent death. thank you.

McGonagall: When I call your name, you come out, and I'll put the Sorting Hat on your head, and you'll be sorted into your rooms. Hermione Granger.

Hermione: Oh, yeah. It’s good to relax. {Continues}

Ronnie: I think I'll tell you.

Harry nodded his head in agreement.

Hat Choice: Ah, so...hmm...fair. Well…Gryffindor!!

(Cheers)



Hermione jumps up with a smile.



McGonagall: Draco Malfoy.



Draco stands up proudly. The Clipped Hat will melt away before it touches Draco's head.



Hat Option: Slytherin!



Ron: There isn't a wizard or non-wizard that went bad that wasn't in Slytherin.

McGonagall: Susan Bones.



A small one with red hair walks away.

Harry looked up and saw the dark-haired professor, SEVERUS SNAPE, staring at him. His blood aches.



Harry: Ahhh! {places hand on forehead}

Ronnie: Harry, what is it?

Harry: Nothing… nothing is fine.



Hat Choice: Let’s see…I know…Hufflepuff!

McGonagall: Ronald Weasley.



Ron ate it and walked away. He sits down and Phil lies down.



Hat Choice: Oh! Another weasel. I know where you are…Gryffindor!!

Ronnie: {cheering}

(Cheers)



McGonagall: Harry Potter.



Everything is quiet. Harry walked over and sat down.



Cloak Choice: Hm...complicated, very complicated. I see a lot of kindness, not stupidity, either. There’s the talent, oh yes, and the thirst to prove yourself. But where do you put it?

Harry: {whispering} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.

Choice of hat: Not Slytherin, no? Do you believe? You can be a good person, you know. It’s all in your head. And Slytherin will help you on your growth journey! No doubt about it! No? {Harry whispers: Not Slytherin…anything but Slytherin} Well, if you’re sure…it’s good enough to be…GRYFFINDOR!!



There’s more yelling and Harry walks over to the Gryffindor table.

Fred and George are also there and exclaim: We found Potter! We got potty! Harry sat down.



McGougali: {dings on a cup} Pay attention, you guys.

Dumbledore: Let the party begin.



Food magically appears on all the tables and the room is filled with awe and conversation.



Harry: Wow.



Draco looks at each bite, raising an eyebrow inquisitively.

Ron covered his face.



Seamus Finnigan, junior, speaking.



Seamus: I'm half and half. My father is a man. Mommy is a witch. It gave him a wicked smile when he found out.

Neville laughs.



Harry sat next to Percy. She turns around.



Harry: Say, Percy, who is this professor talking to Professor Queer?

Percy : Oh, that's Professor Snape, Head of House Slytherin.

Harry: What's he reading?

Percy: Medicines. But everyone knows he loves the dark arts. It’s been years since Quirrell worked.



Ron, having just finished a chicken stone, reached into the pot for more and pulled out a skull demon, Sir Nicholas.



Ronnie: Ahh!

Nick: Thank you! how are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.



Many ghosts come out of the walls to take over the boat.



Hufflepuff Water: Woo-hoo-hoo!

Girl: Look, it's Barry's blood!

Percy: Hi, Sir Nichols. Have a great summer?

Nick: Pain. Once again, my application was denied after hunting fruitlessly. {starts walking away}

Ronnie: Hey, I know you! You’re headless, Nicky!

Nick: I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don’t mind.

Hermione: Isn't there a reason? How can you become brainless?

Nick: Like this. {He grabs her head and pulls her to the side. His head is hanging by a peg.}

Ronnie: Ahh!

Hermione: Yes.



scene:

Percy leads the Gryffindors up the stairs.



Percy: Gryffindors, believe me. Keep at it. thank you.

Boy: Ravenclaw, follow me. In this way.

Percy: This is the best way to get to the bedrooms. Oh, and keep an eye out for changes…they love to squirm.



The camera pans and we see a series of stairs, people walking on them, and others changing direction.



Percy: Keep going and follow me. Killian now, come on. come on. {They start walking up the stairs}

Neville: Seamus, that picture is moving!

Ron: Look at that one, Harry!

Harry: I think she likes you.

Girl: Oh look! see! Who is this girl?

The Man in the Paint: Meet the crop at Hogwarts.

Girl: Who is that?



scene:

We approach the Gryffindor dorm. They’re coming to a big party about a big woman from a radioactive film.



Woman: Secret?
Percy: Capricorn Dragon. {The woman lifts her head and the screen opens to reveal a door in the wall.} Follow me, everyone. Keep coming fast.

Girl: Oh yeah.

Percy: {in the private room} Meet 'em here. Welcome to the Gryffindor dorm. Men’s bedrooms, upstairs and downstairs on your left. Girls, the one on your right. You’ll find your items are already taken.



Location: Midnight. Harry is sitting by the window in his pj's with his owl hedgehog. He squeezes the owl and looks out the window, breathing heavily.





Location: Morning. Harry and Ron run through the quarries to their class. They ran inside. In the classroom, a cat is sitting on a desk.



Ronnie: Wow, amazing, can you imagine the look on Old McGougall's face if we were late?



The cat flies off the desk and transforms into Professor McGonagall. Two amazing guys.



Ronnie: That was interesting.

McGonagall: Thank you for that consideration, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I turn Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket watch, maybe one of you will make it in time.

Harry: We're lost.

McGonagall: So maybe a map? I’m sure you don’t need one to get your seat.



Appearance: Snap’s class of drugs. Students are chatting as they sit near black sofas. The door opened with a snap and he entered.



Snap: No silly sticks in this class. However, I cannot pretend that most of you have the necessary knowledge and skills that is pharmaceutical manufacturing. But a select few of them are {looks at Draco, who smiles}, the kind of people who are so persuasive that I can teach you how to be sensitive and sensitive. I can tell you how to name it, get the shit out of it, and put a lid on the {Draco looks on} death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his gaze, not paying attention.} Then again, perhaps some of you came to Hogwarts with skills that are so formidable that you trust yourself not to…be…noticed.



Hermione knocked Harry's fever. He looks up.



SNAPP: Mr. Potter. Our...old...way. Tell me, what do I get when I add asphaltene root powder to a plant mix? {Hermione's hand is in the sky. Harry shrugged.} Don't you know? Well, let’s try again. Mr. Potter, if I asked you to get me a basket, where would you look? {Hermione's hand raises again.}

Harry: I don't know, sir.

SNAPP: And what's the difference between Monkshod and Wolfbane?

Harry: I don't know, sir.

Snape: Pity. Obviously names aren't everything, right, Mr. Potter?



Location: In a city, maybe during the day. Students will work on homework.



Seamus is watching a dinner over a kiss.



Semis: Rabbit Eye, Musical Strings. Turn this liquid into rum. {Looks into bowl and shakes head

Harry: What is Seamus planning to do with that glass of water?

Ronnie: Changed to Rum. I had some weak tea yesterday before...



Zapof! The crocodile explodes. There is laughter among the students. Suddenly, a group of owls entered the hall from the upper rows.



Ronnie: Ahhh. The letter is here!



The owl flies in and hands out the passes to the students. Harry didn't find anything. He sees the magazine Ron dropped.



Harry: Can I borrow this? {Ron Nod} Thank you.



Neville opens a present. It is a white mountain surrounded by gold.



Semis: Hey, look! Neville got a ramble!

Hermione: I read about those. If the smoke is red {smoke is red}, it means you forgot something.

Neville: The only problem is that I can’t remember what I’ve forgotten.

Harry: Hey Ronnie, someone ran into Gringotts. Listen, he believes it to be the work of dark witches or unknown witches, the Gringotts Goblins, while they admit to the transgression and insist that nothing was taken. The vault mentioned, 713, was blanked on the same day. That's a lot. That’s where Hagrid and I went.



Location: Outdoor flying practice. The students, Gryffindor and Slytherin, are lined up in two rows with the water next to them. Professor MADAM HOOCH is possessed. She has short hair and yellow eyes.



Hotch: Good afternoon class.

Class: Good afternoon, Madame Hutch.

Hotch: Good afternoon, Amanda. {to class} Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone stands up and goes to the right side of their flask. Come now, make haste. Place your right hand on the ground and say: Rise!

Class: Upstairs!



Harry's wand jumped in his hand.



Harry: Wow. {Hermione looks over at the rest of the class.}

Draco: Get up! {The broomstick flies off and Draco smiles to himself.}

Hotch: With a heart!

Hermione: Wake up. above. above. above.

Ronnie: Wake up!! {His wing flies up and sniffs it} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}

Hotch: Now that you've got your privilege, I want you to hold it. And holding it tight, you don’t want to lose the ends. {Class mounts} When I blow my whistle, I want you all to blow my whistle from the ground hard. Keep your shoe in place, walk for a while, then turn slightly and touch the ground. On my phone...3...2...{Tweet!}



Neville immediately stood up. She looks very scared.



Neville: Ohh...

Hotch: Mr. Longbottom.

Girl: Neville, what are you doing?

Student: Neville...Neville...

Man: We shouldn't wake up yet.

Hotch: {Neville starts pacing somewhere} MM-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!

Neville: Ahh!
Hotch: Mr. Longbottom!

Neville: {explodes} Downstairs! down! Ahhh!

Harry: Neville! {Screaming}

Neville: Help!!!

Hotch: Come back this time!

Neville: Ahh!



It flies upwards, hits a wall, stumbles over it, and bounces off. All the while, she continues to cry. He starts to take a shot towards the group of students. Hotch drew his wand to stop him.



Neville: Help!

Hotch: Mr. Longbottom! {Neville approaches. The students split up and Hotch swims out of the way. Neville continues spreading and climbs a tower.}

Neville: Ahhh! Wow! Ahhh! {zooms past a part of the man in the wrong tank. Neville’s clothes cling to him. He blows the bubble and sticks there.} Oh. Ahh...help! {She shakes, and then the cloth tears, and she falls, holding the label, but then she explodes and falls to the ground.} Ah!

Hotch: Everyone out of the way! {He runs into the group, and they split up.} Come on, get up.

Girl: Okay?

Neville: Ooooooh.

Hotch: Oh, oh, oh, oh, Mom. A broken wrist. TC, TC, TC. Good boy, come on now, get up. {Draco reached out and grabbed Neville's consciousness, which had fallen. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.} Everyone must keep their feet facing the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital. understand? If I saw a lone windmill in the air, the person wearing it would find themselves in Hogwarts instead of saying, Quad. {exit.}

Draco: {snickers} Did you see that face? Maybe if the greaseball pressed that, he would have forgotten to fall on his fat ass. {laughs.}

Harry: He'll be here in Malfoy.

Dark: No, I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longboat to find. {hops on broom and jumps around the structure, then through.} How 'bout up on the roof?? {She bounces upstairs.} What's the matter, Potter? Can’t you do it a little?



Harry grabbed his wand and ran up to her. Hermione stopped him.



Hermione: Harry, no! Listen to what Madame Hotch has to say! Besides, you don’t know how to fly. {Harry jumps up.} That's fucking stupid.



Harry was in the air now, in Draco's direction.



Harry: Get it here, Malfoy, or I'll put you in your ass!

Draco: Is that it? {Harry gives him a punch, but Draco spins it around his particle in a 360.} Do as you please! {Throws theory to the wind.}



Harry followed the ball and hurried towards the tower. As he tries to kick in a window where McGonagall is working/watching, he grabs it and then goes back to the group. The students scream and run to see him.



Man: Good job, Harry!

Boy 2: Oh, that was terrible, Harry.

McGonagall: {appears quickly} Harry Potter? Follow me. {Harry follows viciously. Draco and his goons laugh.}



Location: Professor Quier’s classroom. He’s inside, reading, and holding the iguana.



Quirrel: Igona s-like this is {McGonagall approaches the classroom and stops Harry: Wait here.} Something important.

McGonagall: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Professor Quirrell. Can I borrow a tree short term?

Queer: Oh. Y-Yes, of course. {One of the boys, Oliver Wood, gets up and walks away, Crow riding him.} And the vampire b-bat...{eerie roar.}

McGonagall: Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Tree, I got the detective for you!



Scene: Harry and Ron are walking through a crowded town. Sir Nicholas emigrates with a woman.



Nick: Did you hear? Harry Potter is the newest seeker of Gryffindor. I always knew he was going to be OK.

Ronnie: Researcher? But first years never do their home teams! You must be one of the youngest quidditch players.

Harry: A century, according to McGonagall.



Fred and George approached and walked with Ron and Harry.



Fred: Hey, good job Harry Wood just told us!

Ronnie: Fred and George are also in the band. The strikers.

George: Our job is to make sure you have enough blood flow. I can’t make any promises, of course. Serious game, quidditch.

Fred: Britt. But no one died for years. Someone gets lost from time to time... {They separate from Harry and Ron, who are walking through the cabin.

George: But they'll be back in a month or two!!

Ronnie: Ohhhh, Harry Kidditch is great. There’s a good game out there! And you’re going to be a better person too! {Hermione jumps up from her work to join them.}

Harry: But I never played kiddie. What if I made a fool of myself?

Hermione: You can't make a fool of yourself. It’s in your blood.



Scene: The three approach the trophy box. Hermione points to the board of Quidditch players. One names Harry's father as an investigator.



Ronnie: Wow. Harry, you didn't tell me your father was a detective, too.

Harry: II didn't know.





Scene: The three of them are walking up the stairs. Rayleigh leaves…Hermione looks away, but she keeps walking.



Ronnie: I'm telling you, it's bad. It learns a lot about you.

Harry: Who doesn't know?



The ladder shakes with movement. The three of them hold the rail.



Ronnie: Ahh!

Hermonie: {Gasping.}

Harry: What's going on?

Hermione: Scales change, remember? {The staircase will be built on a new floor.}

Harry: {taps Ron} Let's go this way.

Ron: Before moving the stairs again. {They all open a door and enter a gloomy, dark room.}

Harry: Does anyone think...we shouldn't be here?

Hermione: We shouldn't be here. This is the 3rd part. It is forbidden.



Suddenly, a tall stone support was lit by flames. Meanwhile, the President, Mr. R.K. NORRIS, runs back and meows. The team jumps.



Harry: Let's go.

{Meow}

Ronnie: Fuller is a cat!

Harry: Run!



The group flees. The fire blazes as they go. They reach the end of the path through a door. Harry reached for the hand, but it was closed.



Harry: Perfect!

Ronnie: That's what we're done with!

Hermione : Oh, you go! {He jumps out of the barrel} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Down. {They turn to enter.}

Ronnie: Alohomore?

Hermione: Standard Book Standard Chapter 7 .



The flute appears at the beginning of the path with the light. Mrs. Norris looks at him.



Phil: Is someone here, honey? {Meow} Come on. {exit.}

Hermione: Filch is gone.

Ronnie: He probably thinks this door is closed.

Hermione: It was perfect.

Harry: And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turned to stand with Harry. In front of them are three heads of a big dog sleeping. The dog, Fluff, starts to bark. She yells, smiles, and yells loudly…watching people.}

Everyone: Ahhhhhhh! {Three blocks, running out the door. They quickly turn around to open the door and fight for the dog. They close the door and run.}



scene:

We went back to the Gryffindor common room. They’re breathing.



Ronnie: What do they think they're doing?? Shut down such incidents at the school.

Hermione: You don't use your eyes, do you? Have you not seen what it is built on?

Ronnie: I wasn't looking at his feet! I was obsessed with her heads. Or maybe you didn’t notice, there were three! {They start to climb the stairs toward the building.}

Hermione: He was standing on a pillar. Which means he wasn’t there by chance. He’s protecting something.

Harry: To keep something?

Hermione: That's right. Now, if you two don’t mind, I’m going to head out before you two come up with another clever idea to kill us…or, worse, exile us! {She turns and leaves, closing her bedroom door.}

Ronnie: He needs to get his priorities straight!

Harry shook his head.



Location: Outdoors, day time. Oliver and Harry appear, holding a box. They dropped him on the ground.



Olivia: Quidditch is easy to understand. Each time there are six players, 3 opponents, 2 opponents, 1 keeper and an explorer, that’s you. There are three types of bats. {picks up a red one} This is called a quad. Now, investigators are apprehending Kuala Lumpur and trying to place him in one of those three headquarters. {Points to a pitch away from quidditch.} The guard, that’s me, protects the kickers. {Throws the ball at Harry.} So far with me?

Harry: {turning back} I think so. What are they? {Points to two boats hanging from the rope.}

Olivia: ...You better take this. {Harry's hands are in a small fist. He falls down and releases one ball. He flies into the air with a cry of pain. Two men look at him.} Watch out, now he's coming back. {The balls come floating down and Harry smashes them with his wand. The ball rises through a statue. Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a good knife...uh-oh. {The ball drops, Oliver catches it, spins it back into the box. He succeeds and breathes out.} Bludger. Microscopic symptoms. But the only ball I want you to worry about is this… solid gold. {Harry in golden ball-sized hands.}

Harry: I like this ball.

Oliver: Ahh, you like it now. Please wait. It’s too dark to see.

Harry: What am I going to do with it?

Olivia: You'll get it...another battle in front of the Investigator. Catch this, and the game is over. You pull this off, Potter, and we win.

{The ball flares two wings and flies into the air. Harry follows him.}

Harry: Wow.



Location: Professor Flitwick’s classroom. The teacher is very short, standing over a pile of books.



Flitwick: One of the Wizard's basic skills is the ability to lift and move objects. Ehh, do you all have nails? {Hermione raises hers.} Well. Now, don’t forget the nice wrist movement that we learned, eh? Whis and Flick. everyone. {All} Screw and flush. good. And speak. Vingaria Lewison. Off you go then.

Draco: Wingardium Levio-SAA.

{All conditions.}

Ron: Wingadrium Leviosar. {Beat with stick repeatedly.}

Hermione: Stop, stop, stop. You’re going to take someone’s eye out. Besides, you say it in the wrong way. It’s Leviosa, not Leviosa.

Ronnie: So you do if you're smart. Go go go.



Hermione straightened and waved her wand.



Hermione: Wingardium Leviosa. {Breasts are shiny and erect. Ron put his head back down on his books sadly.}

Flitwick: Oh, work! Check it all out here! Mrs. Granger did it! Oh, that's great!



Seamus began to shift in his sex.



Semis: Wingard Lefossa. Wingard Levosa. {Flitwick to Hermione: All right, best friend.}



Bumi!!! Simmons loses his breast. Flitwick cheers.



Flitwick: Wow! Ohhh.

Harry: I think we're going to need another one here, Professor.



Scene: Neville, Harry, Ron, and Seamus are walking in a hallway with other students around them.



Ron: Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, it’s a nightmare. Surprisingly, he didn’t make any friends!



Hermione snorted as she walked by.



Harry: I think he heard you.



Location: Night, in the main room. It’s Halloween. Everyone is eating candy, and Jack Ollante is walking around the place. There are many stories.



Harry: Where's Hermione?

Neville: Parvati Patti says she won’t come out of the girl’s bathroom. She said she had been there all afternoon…crying.

{Ron and Harry exchange looks. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell came running into the room, screaming.

Queer: TROLL! In prison! T-TROOLLL on the rain!! {stops and goes utterly silent.} Think you should know. {Falls dead.}



The town is silent, and then everyone is terrified, screams, and runs away.



Dumbledore: Sillylennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnshieh! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will be happy, don’t be afraid. Now, the prefects leave their horses to live in shelters. The teachers follow me to the dungeon.

Girl: Hufflepuff this way!

Man: Stay together!



Snape hopped down and disappeared through a doorway.



Scene: Percy is driving the house to a courtyard.



Percy: Gryffindors...keep going. And be careful!

Harry: How deep can bullying be?

Ronnie: Not really. Trolls are really smart. Maybe people are joking. {Harry suddenly pulls Ron aside.} What?

Harry: Hermione! He doesn't know!



The two ran out into the streets. They start running down a street standing still, because there is a curve. Harry dragged Ron through a door and into a room with an evil troll.



Harry: He's going into the girls' bathroom!



Scene: In the bathroom, Hermione took a puddle and wiped her eyes. He stops when he sees something. The bullying stops there. Hermione turned and walked into the stall just as the machine raised its wand and sliced through the top of the stall. Hermione screams. In came Harry and Ron.



Harry: Hermione, move!



Disruption cuts into the rest of the market.



Hermione: Help! help! {The boys start throwing wooden blocks on the toss.}

Ron: Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws the tree and hits the truck in the head. Hermione ran out of the bars and ducked under the sink, but the machine saw her and went to smash her. He switches off the drain and forgets about Hermione. Harry snorted.}

Hermione: Ahh! help!



Harry pulled out his wand. He runs to the front, grabs the torture bag, and stands up.



Harry: Wow! Wow, wow! {He lands on top of the train, is thrown forward, and then his stick goes right up the train's nose.}

Ronnie: Eve.



Damage migrates and hits all around.



Harry: Whoa whoa!



The southern took Harry off his head and picked him up by one leg, guiding him down. He readies his bow and shoots Harry. He pulls himself up and down. Damage strikes again.



Harry: Do something! {Insert}

Ronnie: What? {Insert}

Harry: Anything! hurry up!



Ron grabbed his wand. Hermione moved her hand under the sink.



Hermione: Swill and Flick!

Ron: Wingardium Leviosa! {Fix. The mountain bounces off the trumpet's hand and flies above his head. The damage looks up, confusingly, as the club came to fall so low. (Ron: Culp.) He hits Trevor's head and Trevor shakes, then releases Harry, who goes and comes crashing down, badly.



Hermione approaches cautiously.



Hermione: Is he...dead?

Harry: I don't think so. It just came out. {He grabs his cane...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogeys.



Suddenly, McGonagall, Snape, and Quirrell came running inside.

They’ll regret it.



McGonagall: Oh! Oh my goodness! E-Introduce yourselves, both of you!

Ron and Harry : Yeah, that's what...

Hermione : It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, including Ron and Harry, cheer}

McGonagall: Miss Granger?

Hermione: I went looking for trouble. I was reading about them and thought I could do it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn’t come to find me…I probably would have died.

McGonagall: Anyway...that's a terrible thing to do. {Harry looks at Snape's leg...it has a large cut. Snape noticed and closed his eyes, glancing back at Harry.} I was expecting a lot more expectant behavior from you, Mrs. Granger. 5 Gryffindor points will be deducted for your poor judgment. Take you two guys, I hope you realize how important you are. Many students cannot afford to take a short class and live to deliver. 5 points...will be given to each of you. Because of sheer luck. {Snape and McGonagall exit.}

Quirrell: Maybe you should go...m-he might wake up...hey. {Exit Ron, Harry, and Hermione.} {Troll screams.} Ahh! Heh….



Location: The next morning, in the Great Plaza. The group sat down to eat. Harry was stirring his food on the fridge.



Ronnie: Take a tote, take my friend.

Hermione: Ron's boyfriend, Harry. You need your strength today.

Harry: I'm not hungry.



Snap appears.



Snape: Good luck today, Potter. After all, you’ve proven yourself against torture, and a little quidditch game should be an easy task for you…even if it’s against Slytherin. {Leaves, to simplify.}

Harry: That explains Joel.

Hermione: Joel?

Harry: Listen, last night I'm guessing Snape introduced torture as a diversion so he could try and outrun that 3-headed dog. But, he hurt himself and that’s why he breaks.

Hermione: But why would anyone get close to that dog?

Harry: I was at Gringotts the day Hagrid pulled something out of a vacuum. He said it was a top-secret Hogwarts affair.

Hermione: So you're saying...

Harry: That's what dogs control. That’s what Snape is.

{The owl cries. That’s Hedwig. It takes a long, hard coat. He leaves it.}

Hermione: Quick on the letter, isn't it?

Harry: But I never get a letter.

Ronnie: Let's open it up.

{They open it.}

Harry: It's a flower!
Ron: It's not just flowers, Harry. It’s the Nibus 2000!

Harry: But who...?

{She sees Professor McGonagall at the head of the table, manipulating Hedwig. She smiles and Harry shakes his head.}



Scene: Inside the Quidditch Tower. The Gryffindor class walked towards the starting gate. They get there and stop behind locked double doors.



OIiver: Are you scared, Harry?

Harry: Little by little.

Olivia: That’s all right. I was the same way before my first game.

Harry: What happened?
Oliver: Erin, I don't remember. I took a bludger to the head within 2 minutes. I woke up in the hospital a week later.



Harry ate as the doors opened in front of him. They put up their pictures and take a long shot on the big stage. There is congratulations. The narrator, LEE JORDAN, speaks from a tower.



Lee: Hello, and welcome to the first Quidditch game of the season at Hogwarts! Today’s game between Slytherin vs Gryffindor!!!



{Thank you. Gryffindor students reaction. They’re crying. Neville: Gryffindor!}



Players take positions in the air in a circle. Harry weaves in, usually in the middle. He looks down.



Lee: The players take their positions as Madame Hotch steps out onto the court and begins the game.

Hotch: Now I want a good clean game...you all do. {Looks at Slytherin. It hits the box and shrinks the pile.}

Lee: The blunders rise...then the Golden Snitch. Remember, the number of sneakers is 150. The detective holding the Snitch ends the game.



The snitch zooms in on each Seeker’s head, then disappears. Hotch holds the kettlebell.



Lee: The Quaffle is out...and the game begins!



Gryffindor keep possession of the ball and one of the players, ANGELIN JOHNSON, takes the lead on Slytherin towards their goal, throws the ball and scores! There is a hole.



Lee: Angelina Johnson did the rope! 10 points for Gryffindor! {He presses a button and 10 appears next to a plate with Gryffindor's name on it.}



Harry, in the air, claps.



Harry: Yes! {A bludger reacts to him.} Whoa!



Gryffindor cheers from the stands.



Hagrid: All right!

Lee: Slytherin took the Quaffle. Bletchley went with Captain Marcus Flint.



Flint avoids people and throws them at the Gryffindor orphans. Oliver appears and kicks the ball with his element. He smiles at Flint, who grins back. Johnson and Katie Bell pass Kuvel back and forth as they plan to get the ball. Johnson went on to throw and score once more!



Ron and Seamus: Yeah!

Harry: Yes!

Lee: 10 more points for Gryffindor! {Eng.}

Gryffindor: Yes!



The Slytherins tried to intervene. They swing, shoot, and try to score. Once again, Oliver blocks.



Flint: Give it to me! {He grabs a beaters bat and hits a bludger at Oliver. He punched Olivia in the stomach and she fell to the ground.}



Crowd: {Boeing}

Harry was sad.

Slytherin laughs.



The Slytherins leave. Someone jumps on George (or Fred) and scores. Harry was angry again. Slytherin exclaims.



Flynn: {to the others} Take that side!



They bundle Johnson in and send him into the closet that covers one of the mansions. He falls in and out. The crowd cheers. The Slytherin lent once more. Suddenly, Harry saw Snitch. He starts to drop his head and then his wings start bouncing and spinning.



Harry: Wow! Wow!

Hagrid: What's going on with Harry's Flower?



Hermione looks at Harry in the redhead, then at Snape, who is mumbling something.



Hermione: Snap! It's burning flowers!

Ronnie: Jeannette? What are we doing?

Hermione: Leave it to me. {Gives Ron his bikini and leaves.}



Harry was hit and then fell, only to escape with one arm from the particle.



Ron: Come on, Hermonie!



Hermione speeds up a tower. He steps out from under Snap and touches his dress with his wand.



Hermione: Lacarnum fever.



A fire crackles and Snape's costume catches fire. Hermione leaves.



Man: Fire! You’re on fire!

Snape: What? Oh! {Kicks the man backwards, and the one who fell into Quirrell then falls back. Snape put out the fire and pretended nothing had happened. The giant stops throbbing and Harry climbs back up. The Slytherin seeker is after Snitch. Harry wakes up.}



Ronnie: Go!

Hagrid: Go, go, go!



Harry punched the Slytherin seeker, then punched him. He comes back to bite the detective again, just as the Snitch sneezes. The men follow, but quickly approach the ground. As the Slytherin seeker retreated, Harry pulled his Element and followed behind the Snitch, feet above the ground. Harry stood up and walked forward trying to catch the toy. He goes too far and knocks Price off with a scream and falls to the ground. He gets up and moves.



The crowd gasps. Hermione appeared near a tower and saw him.



Hagrid: Looks like he's going to be sick!



Harry flinched and the snitch fell out of his mouth. She falls into his arms.



Lee: Got the Snitch! Harry Potter gets 150 points for catching a Snitch!

Hotch: {Blows whistle} Gryffindor has won!

Everyone: Yes!

Draco: No!

Hagrid: Yeah!

Hermione: Whee-huh!

McGonagall: {laughs merrily}



Harry lifted Snitch into the air and the crowd and his team cheered.



Crowd: Go, go Gryffindor! Go, go, Gryffindor! Go, go, Gryffindor! Go, go, Gryffindor!






scene:
Harry, Hermione, and Ron are walking down a path with Hagrid, talking.



Hagrid: Keyword. Why does Snape curse Harry about the Element?

Harry: Who knows. Why was he trying to get past those 3 dogs in Halloween?

Hagrid: Who told you about Fluffy?

Ronnie: Smooth?
Hermione: Does this thing have a name?

Hagrid: Yes, of course it has a name. It's mine. I bought it from an Irish guy I saw in the shop last year. I then lent it to Dumbledore to .

Harry: Yeah?

Hagrid: I shouldn't say that. Don’t ask any more questions. It’s top secret, that is.

Harry: But Hagrid, whatever Flaffy's protection is, Snape wants to steal it!

Hagrid: Codesswalop. Professor Snape is a professor at Hogwarts.

Hermione: Hogwarts professor or not, I know a curse when I see one. I read them all. You need to keep your eyes open. And Snape didn't bat an eye.

Harry: Right.

Hagrid: {sighs} Now, all three of you listen to me. You’re getting involved in things you shouldn’t be involved in. That’s dangerous. What this dog is protecting is between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

HARRY: Nicholas Flamel?

Hagrid: I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn’t have said that. I shouldn’t have said that. {exit.}

Harry: Nicolas Flamel…who is Nicolas Flamel?

Hermione : No , you don't.



Location: Christmas. The camera pans to an ice castle and then to Hagrid, who brings a large tree. Inside the main arena, the students come out and the ghosts sing (Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Hogwarts's bell rings, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas...) Hermione approaches the empty tables and sips a glass. He goes to Ron and Harry who are tennis players.



Harry: Ride to E-5.



A piece moves on the board.



Ron thinks for a moment.



Ronnie: Engineer through E-5.



An officer walks up to the E-5 and frees the room.



Hermione: That's Barbara !

Ronnie: It’s the devil’s kiss. I saw you had your things ready.

Hermione: Let's see you die.

Ron: Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to see my brother Charlie. He’s studying dragons there!

Hermione: Okay. You can help Harry then. She goes to the library to get information on Nicole Flamel.

Ronnie: We tried a hundred times!

Hermione: Not in the specific section...Merry Christmas. {leave.}

Ronnie: I think we had the wrong effect on him.



scene:

X-mas morning. Hedwig is sitting in the boys' room and Harry is sleeping on the bed.



Ron: {Calling downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on, Harry, wake up!



Harry got up and ran to a balcony overlooking the common room where Ron was standing next to a tree. She wears a suit with an R on it.



Ronnie: Merry Christmas, Harry.

Harry: Merry Christmas, Ronnie. What are you wearing?

Ronnie: Oh, my mom made it for me. Sounds like you got one too!

Harry: I have presents?

Ronnie: Yeah!

Harry: Oh! {Harry ran down the stairs.}

Ronnie: They are. {Ron sits on the arm of the sofa eating beans while Harry picks up a silver roll. Harry takes out the card.}

Harry: "Your father left this to me before he died. It's time for it to return to you. You will make good use of it."



Harry opens the elemental. It’s a dress.



Ronnie: What is that?

Harry: Some kind of clothes.

Ronnie: Well, let's see, then. Put it down.



Harry got dressed and all but his head disappeared.



Ronnie: Wow!

Harry: My skin is broken!

Ronnie: I know what that is! It’s the sight of invisibility!

Harry: I'm invisible??

Ronnie: {sighs} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.

Harry: {Coming in} There's no name. He just said, "Make good use of it."



scene:

It’s a long night. A torch and a hand appear, but nothing else. The group walks through the dark library and into the restricted section. The lamp is turned off and the clothes are removed. Harry appears.



Harry: {reading the books} Fire Eater greats...Sack 15 villains...Fmelmil...Nicholas Flammel...where are you?



Harry picked up a book and opened it. A man’s face emerges.



Man: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!



Harry closed the book and handed it back.



Flower's voice: Who's there?! {Harry snaps, grabbing at his cloak. The lamp falls and breaks.} I know you’re there. You can't hide. {Harry puts on his cloak and goes around Filch.} Who is that? Show yourself!



Harry ran out of the room, breathing heavily. He went into the room where Mrs. Norris was. The cat meows and starts to back away from him. Harry fled around the corner, just as Snape and Quirrell came into view. Snap knocks Quirrell into the wall.



Quirrell: Severus...I thought...

Snape: You don't want me to be your enemy, Quirrell.

Queer: W-What do you mean?

Snape: You know exactly what I mean. {Snape sensed something. Harry breathed. Snape reached out to grab something, but he didn't. He snaps his finger in Quirrell's face.} We'll have another conversation soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.



Filch appears, holding a broken lantern.



Phil: Oh, teachers. I found this, at the door. It’s still hot. In other words, a student got out of bed.



They all run away. A door opens and closes. On the other side is a large, empty room with a large mirror in the center. Harry walked out and walked over to the mirror. He sees two people in it.



Harry: Mom? {The woman nods and smiles} Dad? {Smile and laugh. Harry reached out to touch them, but found only a mirror. Then her mother reaches out to her. He puts his hand to his chest as if trying to keep it there.



scene:

The men’s room. Harry came knocking, invisible.



Harry: Ronnie! You really need to see this! Ronnie! You have to see this! {After pulling the covers. Ron woke up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!

Ronnie: Why?

Harry: There's something you have to see. Now, come on!



scene:

Back in the mirror room. Harry and Ron looked like magic and Harry ran to the mirror.



Harry: Come on. come. Look, it’s my parents!

Ronnie: I'm just me.

Harry: {moves over} Take a closer look. Go go. Stop right there. there. Do you see them? That's my father.

Ronnie: It's me! Except, I’m the boss… and I’m holding the Quidditch Cup! And bloody hell I’m a Quidditch captain too! I'm good. Harry, do you think this mirror represents the future?

Harry: How is that possible? Both of my parents are deceased. {Harry smiles happily.}



scene:

Another night. Harry sat in front of the mirror. Dumbledore appears behind him.



Dumbledore: Back again, Harry? {Harry turns his back to get up.} I see that, like many others before you, you have discovered the joys of Irish magic. I’m sure by now you understand what it does. I'll give you an answer. A happy person looks in the mirror and sees only themselves as they really are.

Harry: So, what does that tell us what we want? Anything we want?

Dumbledore: Yes…and no. It shows us nothing or the deepest desires of our hearts. Now that you’ve never known your family, you stand by them. But remember this, Harry. This mirror does not give us knowledge or truth. The men disappeared in front of him, still weak. That’s why tomorrow it’s going to a new home, and I have to tell you not to look for it anymore. It was okay to dream and forget about life, Harry. {Harry looks in the mirror.}



scene:

during the day. It’s all ice. Harry is in a large space, tied up and Hedwig in his arms. He stops and jumps up into the sky. When he returns, it’s spring.



scene:

in the library. Harry and Ron sit down to read. Hermione brings over a large book. He slams it on the table. Harry jumps.



Hermione: I've been looking at you in the wrong place! How stupid could I be? I tried this a few weeks ago to do a little reading.

Ronnie: Is this a light?

Hermione: {chuckles} Of course! It’s here! "Nicholas Flamel is the only known master of the Philosopher's Stone!"

Ron and Harry: What?

Hermione: Really, aren't you two studying? "The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary item with incredible power. It will turn all metal into pure gold and produce the elixir of life that will make the drinker immortal."

Ron: Immortal?

Hermione: Which means you'll never die.

Ronnie: I know what that means!

Harry: Liz!

Hermione: "The only stone now standing is that of Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the famous Almien, who celebrated his 665th birthday last year!" That's the flower on the 3rd floor. That’s what’s under the iron gate…the Philosopher’s Stone!



They all looked at each other.



scene:

Night time. Hermione, Ron, and Harry run through the wet ground to Hagrid's hut. They knock and the door opens.



Harry: Hagrid!

Hagrid: {Puts on gloves and buffer} Oh, hey. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be mad, but I can't play today. {Close door.}

All 3: We know the Philosopher's Stone!

{The door opens.}

Hagrid: Ohhh.

{They all arrive in Hagrid's little hut.}

Harry: We think Snape is trying to steal it.

Hagrid: Snap? Blimey, Harry, you're still not talking about her, are you?

Harry: Hagrid, we know he's behind the Stone. We don’t know why.

Hagrid: Snape is a teacher guarding the Stone! She wasn't going to steal it!

Harry: What?

Hagrid: You heard that. right. Come on now, I'm busy today.

Harry: Wait a minute. {Ronnie and a large black dog, Fang, get along. Fang sniffs Ron.} A teacher?
Hermione: {sits down in the big chair} Sure! There are other things that defend the stone, right? Magic, magic.

Hagrid: That's right. A bloody waste of time if you ask me.

{Hermione looks at Ron, whom Fang is kissing on the cheek. Ron shuffles away.} Nobody gets past Fluffy. Hehe, not sure how this works. Just me and Dumbledore. I shouldn’t have told you that. I shouldn’t have told you that. {A mountain on fire begins to spin.} Oh! {Hagrid quickly grabs something} Oh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! {Puts the thing, egg, on the table. The team surrounds.}

Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what is that exactly?

Hagrid: That? That’s… it um…

Ronnie: I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?

Hagrid: I won. I met a family at a shop. It was like I was happy to get rid of it as a matter of course.



The egg will scrunch up and crack. The pieces fly out like a dragon. She screams and plays on the other hand.



Hermione: Is that... a dragon?

Ronnie: It's not just drugs. It’s a Norwegian Redback! My brother Charlie works with them in Romania.

Hagrid: Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Don't dare look at it. He knows his wife. Hehe. Congratulations Norbert. {The dragon groans and looks at Hagrid.}

Harry: Norbert?

Hagrid: Yeah, well, he deserves a name, right?

Ronnie: {laughs}

Hagrid: Don't you know that, Norbert? {Raises his fingers back and forth on Norbert's chin} DEDDED.



Norbert turned, snorted, and fired a fireball at Hagrid's chin.



Hagrid: Oh! Oh, oh, oh, well...she needs a little practice, of course. {Norbert's Hickey. Hagrid sees someone looking out the window.} Who is that? {The person runs away.}

Harry: Malfoy.

Hagrid: Oh, my gosh.


scene:

The three of them walk back into an alley. The owl crows.

Harry: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me the first time I saw him.

Ronnie: It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knew it.

Harry: I don't understand. Is that so bad?

Ronnie: It’s not good.

When they stop, McGonagall is in her nightgown.

McGonagall: Good night.

Malfoy appears next to him.

scene:

McGonagall’s classroom. The three accused were standing in front of McGonagall's desk while Malfoy was a few feet away, grinning.

McGonagall: Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk to school at night. Therefore, as a penalty for your actions, 50 points will be deducted.

Harry: 50?!

McGonagall: Each one. And to make sure it never happens again, all four of you will be arrested.

Malfoy nodded, and then his smile vanished.

Draco: Excuse me, Professor. Maybe I heard you wrong. I thought you said..."The four of us."

McGonagall: No, you heard me right, Mister Malfoy. You noticed, your intent was strong, you were also on your bed moments later. You will have fun with your classmates.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione smile, and so does Draco.

scene:

Outside, in the evening, the four students are visited by Mr. Phillips in Hagrid's bubble.

Phil: Sorry they let the old warrants die. There was a time when someone would have you by the wrists in jail. God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes past.} You're going to have to behave with Hagrid tonight. He has a job to do in the Black Forest. {Hagrid appears with a bow. He sniffles.} Sorry about that, Hagrid. Oh good god man, aren't you still into that bloody bloody thing?

Hagrid: {smiles and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him to Rome to live in a colony.

Hermione: Well, okay? She does it with herself.

Hagrid: Yes, but what if he doesn't like Romany? {Filch rolls his eyes.} Aren't these other fields too dangerous for him? She is only a child after all.

Phil: Oh, for gods' sake, get rid of it, man. You’re going into the woods after all. You have to focus on you.

Draco: Wild? I thought it was a joke! We can't get in there. Students are not eligible. And...{screams}...there are slimes!

Phil: There's a lot of people in these trees, boy. You can count on that. {Draco panics.} Night-night. {exit.}

Hagrid: Right. Let's go.

Location: In the forest. The group walks down a path to a tree. Hagrid stopped, bent down and dug his fingers into a pool of silver. He pulls his fingers out and rubs them together. The silver phone wiggled his fingers.


Harry: Hagrid, what is that?

Hagrid: What are we here for. Have you seen it? It’s the Unicorn blood, that is. I had someone pass away a few weeks ago. Now, this one was seriously injured. {Harry was surprised to see a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, our job is to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you're coming with me.

Ronnie: {frantic} Okay.

Hagrid: And Harry, you're going with Malfoy. {Draco frowns and Harry nods his head.}

Draco: All right. Then I get stronger!

Hagrid: All right. Just so you know, he’s a terror builder. {Fan cheers.}



scene:

Harry and Draco walk through the forest, Fang leading the way. Draco has the torch.



Draco: You wait until my father hears about this. This is businessmen’s stuff.

Harry: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.

Draco: Are you scared, Potter?! {Skoff} {Hugh} Did you hear that? Come on Fang. afraid.


scene:

The group approaches a flat city with difficult roots on all sides. The fan stops and then screams.



Harry: What's that, fan?


In the foreground, a figure lay over a dead cowboy, sucking its blood. The figure raised its head, silvery blood dripping from its mouth.


Harry gasps and sucks in his aching blood.


Draco: {looks obviously horrified} AHHHHHHHHH!!! Ahhh! {Runs, with a fan} HELP!!!!


Harry was left alone. The figure slides over each grain and lifts it up. She walks towards Harry, who backs her up, but keeps walking. He's going backwards. Suddenly, there’s the sound of stomping feet. A figure flies past Harry and lands near the cloaked figure. It’s Silver Centre, FIRENZE. He gets up, and the victim jumps out.


Ference: Harry Potter, you must go. Many creatures here know you. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially not for you.

Harry : {rises} But what did you save me from?

Firenze: Is a weird distinction. It’s a terrible crime to kill a cockroach. Drinking the blood of the dragon will keep you alive even if you are only a meter away from death. But at a terrible price. The moment you kill something clean and the blood touches your mouth, then you get half a chance. Limited life.

Harry: But who chooses this life?

Ferrance: Can't you think of anybody?

Harry: You mean...that thing that killed Unix...that drank her blood...that was Voldemort?

Ferrance: Do you know what's hidden inside the school this time?

Harry: The Philosopher’s Stone.


Suddenly, the dog (Fang) barks. Harry looked up and saw Hagrid, Hermione, Ron, and Draco.


Hermione: Harry!

Hagrid: Thank you, Firanger. I see you have met our young Master Potter – are you all right there, Harry? {Harry nods his head}

Francis: Harry Potter, I'll leave you there. You are now saved. good luck.

{Close Dead Friends.}


scene:

Gryffindor Public House. Immediately after the 'attack'. The group gathers around the fire. Hermione and Ron were sitting, but Harry was standing.


Hermione: You mean you know who's out there in the woods right now?

Harry: But it's not weak. He lives with unicorns. Don't you see? We weren’t good. Snape doesn’t want the Stone for himself, he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Life Elixir, Voldemort will be powerful again. He’s coming back. {Sits down.}

Ronnie: But if he comes back, do you think he's going to try to kill you?

Harry: I think he could have killed me tonight.

Ron: {Gulp} And to think I was getting bored with my last post!

Hermione: Wait a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who is Voldemort always scared?

{The men cheer.} Dumbledore! As long as Dumbledore was around, you were safe. As long as Dumbledore is there, you are untouchable. {Harry smiles a little.}



scene:

After some time. in the outer bank. The three walk away.


Hermione: I've always heard that Hogwarts end-of-year exams are dreadful, but I actually found them quite interesting.

Ronnie: Speak for yourself. Okay, Harry?

Harry: My blood. It’s burning.

Hermione: It's been a while.

Harry: This isn't like that.

Ronnie: Maybe you should see a therapist.

Harry: I think it's a warning. That means risks are coming. Uhh! {He smells Joel and sees Hagrid in the dungeon in his hut.} Oh. of course! {Runs home.}

Hermione: What's that?

Harry: Don't you think it's weird that the thing Hagrid wants more than anything is a wand, and a stranger shows up and it just happens? {They approach Hagrid, who is speaking Harry Potter stories through his flute.} I mean, how many people walk around with horns in their pockets? Why haven’t I seen it yet? Who Hagrid called you a dragon? {Hagrid stops playing.} What does he look like?

Hagrid: I don't know. I never saw his face. She grabbed his cock.

Harry: Strange as you are to have talked to him.

Hagrid: Well, he wanted to know what kind of creatures I stare at. I told him. "Fliff's back won't be a problem," I said.

Harry: And it looks like he needs Fluffy?

Hagrid: Well, of course he liked Fluffy! How often do you come across three dogs, even when you’re on business? But I told him. I said, "The trick to any animal is to know how to calm it down. Take Fluffy, for example, sing him a song and he'll fall asleep."


The three of them arrested.


Hagrid: I shouldn't have told you. {The three of them stand up.} Where are you going?! wait!


scene:

McGonagall’s classroom. The three of them come crashing and running down the hallways between desks. They pass a ghost and stop at the desk.


Harry: We must see Professor Dumbledore at once!

McGonagall: I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore isn't here. He obtained an owl from the Ministry of Magic and immediately left for London.

Harry: Gone?! now? But this is important! He’s…an amazing philosopher.

McGonagall: {choking} How do you know?

Harry: Someone is going to try to steal it.

McGonagall: I don't know how you three know about this stone, but I can assure you it's well-preserved. Now can you go back to your bedrooms? peacefully. {They leave.}



scene:

After leaving McGonagall's class, they walk down the hallway.


Harry: That's not the stranger Hagrid saw in the village. It was Snape, which meant he knew how to get through to Fluffy.

Hermione: And Dumbledore's gone.

{Snape appears behind them}

SNAPP: Good afternoon. Now, what are three Gryffindor boys like yourselves doing inside these days?

Hermione: Uhh...we were just...

SNAPP: You want to be careful. People think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who seems amused} about something. {exit.}

Hermione: Now what do we do?

Harry: We're going down to the mouth of the river. tonight.


Location: Night time. In the Gryffindor common room. The three friends descended the stairs and began to walk across the land. They stop when they hear the chorus.


Harry: Trevor.

Ronnie: Trevor shh! Go away, you’re not supposed to be here!

Neville: {stepping out from behind a chair} You shouldn't either. Are you going out on your own?

Harry: Now, Neville, listen. We were

Neville: No! I won't let you! {stands} You're getting Griffith in trouble again! I’m fighting for you. {Holds up hands.}

Hermione: Neville, I'm sorry for that...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus.



Neville freezes and falls backwards to the ground. Hermione tossed her wand back.



Ron: {gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know? It’s exciting, but scary.

Harry: Let's go. {to Neville} I'm sorry.

Hermione: I'm sorry.

Ronnie: It's for your own interests, you know. {exit.}


Appearance: The three of them are under cloaks of invisibility, hiding through the corridor.


Hermione: Oh! You stood on my feet!

Ronnie: I'm sorry. {The flame burns. Hermione pulled out her wand and pointed to the door.}

Hermione: Alohomora.


The door opens and they enter.


Ronnie: Hold on a minute...it's....{A gust of wind, and Cap flies over them.} Sleep.

Harry: Snap is already here. He works magic with the music. {They approach the sleeping dog.}

Ronnie: Ahhh. He has bad breath!

Harry: We should move his leg.

Ronnie: What?!

Harry: Come on! {grabs paw, which opens the door.} All right. push! {They put it on and move it. They open.} I go first. Don’t follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, remove yourself...does it seem a little...gentle?

Hermione: Musician. He stopped the game.

A single head of water lands on Ron's shoulder.

Ronnie: Eve! Yuki! Aug. {The three kids wake up to see Phil standing there. Soft and curt cries, thrashing. He breaks the harness and dives into three.}

Harry: Fly! go! {They all fly to the trapdoor.}

Ronnie: Ahh! {Gasps as he lands on what looks like black ropes.} Whoa. Lucky this plant is here, indeed.

Harry: Wow! {The tree starts to move towards them.} Oh. Ahhh! {The tree knocks them out.}

Hermione: Both of you, stop moving. This is a trap of the devil. You need to relax. Failure to do so will quickly kill you.

Ron: Kill us quickly?! Oh, now I can relax!

Hermione could only manage a small smile as she kissed the bottom.

Ron and Harry: Hermione!!

Ronnie : Now what do we do?!

Hermione's voice: Just relax!

Harry: Hermione! where are you?!

Hermione (from below): Do what I say. Believe me.

Harry relaxed and sucked.

Ronnie: Ahh! Harry!

Harry fell to the hard ground. Hermione went over and stood up.

Ron: Harry!

Hermione: Are you okay?

Harry: Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

Ronnie: Help!

Hermione: He's not resting, is he?

Harry: It's like, not.

Ronnie: Help! Help me!

Hermione: We have to do something!

Harry: What?

Hermione: Ahh! I remember reading something about weed. {Ron: HELP!} Wm Devil's Fear, Devil's Fear, {George covers Ron's door} It's bad fun...but he'll eat it in the sun! That’s it! The devil’s thread hates the light of the sun! {Takes out a barrel and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A light appears. Jim groans and gets up. Ron falls to the ground.}

Ronnie: Ahhh!

Harry: Ronnie, are you okay?

Ronnie: Yeah.

Harry: Okay.

Ronnie: {pauses} Wow. We were so excited, not afraid!

Harry: Lucky Hermione is paying attention to botany.

There is a sound.

Hermione: What's that?

Harry: I don't know. It’s like halls.


They enter a room full of "birds."

Hermione: I'm curious. I had never seen birds like this.

Harry: They're not birds, they're mountains. And I would say some of them fit that threshold. {They come upon an air bubble that was in the air.}

Hermione: What's that all about?

Harry: I don't know. strange.

{Ron goes to the door and takes out his briefcase.}

Ronnie: {Looks at Luke.} Alhomore! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try.

Hermione: Oh! What are we going to do? There should be 1,000 keys up there!

Ronnie: We're looking for something very old. Probably as good as a piano.

Harry: There! I saw it! {points} What a broken frame! {Looks at the picture.}

Hermione: What's wrong, Harry?

Harry: It’s very simple.

Ronnie: Oh, go Harry! If Snap can handle it with that old particle, you can! You’re the youngest researcher of the century!


Harry shook his head and grabbed the flower. The keys suddenly went in one direction, towards Harry. He climbs on top of her and smirks at them.



Ronnie: That complicates things a bit!

Harry leapt into the air. He flies to the back of the boat. The rest follow. Harry gripped the key.


Harry: Take the key!

He magnified and threw the key at Hermione, who caught it and headed for it while Harry fumbled with the other keys. Hermione put him in the lock.

Ronnie: Quick!

The door opened and Hermione and Ron ran in, followed by Harry. They locked the door and slammed the keys.

scene:

They entered a dark room surrounded by broken pieces.

Hermione: I don't like this. I don’t like this.

Harry: Where are we? A stone.

Ronnie: This isn't a grave. {sighs} That’s the dating process. {He goes out onto the platform and turns on the lights, spotting Pearl and the GIANT players. Harry and Hermione join him.}

Harry: There's the door.

They walk up the plank to the door. Suddenly, they reached the crowd, and the crowd drew their guns. The three of them fly off and back up.

Hermione: Now what do we do?

Ronnie: Is it obvious? We have to play our way through the room. all right. Take the bishop’s place, Harry. Hermione, you're going to be next door to the queen. As for me, I’ll be a housewife. {They all take their turn.}

Hermione: What's going on now?

Ronnie: {aboard a horse.} Well, white goes first, and then...we play. {There is a pie on the other side leading forward. Ronnie reads the game.}

Hermione: Ron, you didn't think this was going to be like... a real wizard's wizardry, did you?

Ronnie: There you are! D-5! {The black point moves forward, towards the white point. The white pawn raises his swords and smashes the black. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be like magic for a coincidence!

The game goes on. The pieces smash into each other, boom! Boom!

Ronnie: Cash for E-4! SMS! Ronnie: Paws to C-3! SMS! Boom! The prince turns around and breaks something! Harry, Ron, and Hermione grinned. The prince turned again. Both Ron and Harry read the game.

Harry: Wait a minute.

Ron: You understand perfectly, Harry. When I have done my walk, the King will take me…and then you will be free to see the King.

Harry: No, Ronnie! No!

Hermione: What's that?

Harry: He's going to sacrifice himself!

Hermione: No, Ronnie, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There has to be another way!

Ron: {He turns to Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, you're the one who should go. I know. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nodded.} Knight...to H-3.

Ron's horse lurches forward and skids to a halt.

Ronnie: Check it.

The prince turned and walked forward. Ron's breath quickens and he grabs onto the steel frame. The king stopped. Smash! Ron dismounted and fell to the ground, unconscious.

Ronnie: Ahhh!

Harry: Ron! {Hermione starts walking with him.} No! Don’t laugh! Don’t forget, we’re still playing. {Hermione returns. Harry walks right in front of the king.} Checkmate. {The sword of the kings falls to the ground . Harry exhaled and then they both ran towards Ron. They crouch nearby.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the Village. Send a letter to Dumbledore. Ron’s right…I have to move on.

Hermione: You'll be fine, Harry. You are truly a great magician for you.

Harry: It's not as good as that.

Hermione: {laughs} Me? Books and spirit? There are important issues. Friendship and loyalty. And Harry, just be careful.



Harry nodded and stood to walk away.

scene:

Harry descends a long flight of stairs to an empty room with pillars all around. In the middle of the room is a mirror with a man standing in front of it, Quirrell. Harry cried out, holding his wound.

Harry: You? {Kyrell turns.} Nope. It can’t be…Snap. That was it.

Queer: Yeah. It seems kind of weird, doesn't it? Who aside from me complains about "pp-poor s-stuttering Professor Queer?"

Harry: B-but that day during the Quidditch tournament, Snape tried to kill me.

Queer: No, my boy. I decided to kill you! And believe me, if Snape’s suit hadn’t caught fire and cut my eye, I would have won. Even with Snape murmuring his little curse.

Harry: Snape was trying to save me?

Queer: I knew you were dangerous from the beginning. Especially after Halloween.

Harry: O-then you stopped bothering and went inside.

KIERER: Pretty good putter, yeah. Snape, unfortunately, didn’t cheat. While everyone else was running towards the jail, he went to the 3rd floor and killed me. She didn’t believe me anymore. He didn’t leave me alone. {Kirell turns back to the mirror, Harry is hurting.} But he doesn't understand. I’m never alone. never. Now…what does this mirror do? I have what I want. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I find it?

{A gruff, Voldemort voice calls out.}: Using the child.

Queer: Come here, Potter, now!

Harry walked forward and shivered.

Queer: Tell me. What do you see?

Harry looks at him in the mirror. He sees himself. His mirror reached into his pocket and pulled out a red stone. The mirror regains its eyes and returns the stone. Harry reached heavily into his pocket. There is a cross. It takes the air out.

Queer : What is that?! What do you see?!

Harry: Shaking hands with Dumbledore. I won the horse cup.

Voldemort's voice : He's lying.

Quinn: Tell the truth! What do you see?!

Voldemort's voice: Let me talk to him.

Quinn: Prince, you are very weak.

Voldemort's voice: I have the power for this. {Quair opens his turban, and in front of his face another face opens. Voldemort is what looks like a snake. He stretched and faced Harry in the mirror.} Harry Potter. See you soon again.

Harry: Voldemort.

Voldemort: Yes. See what I’ve become? See what I need to do to survive? Thank you for another birthday. Just Narnia. Blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me my own body. But there is something that can be done. There’s something in your pocket, and that’s pretty cool!

Harry turned and ran.

Voldemort: Stop it! {Quire snaps his fingers and fire explodes around the room. Harry is stuck.} Don’t be silly! Why suffer a cruel death when you can marry me and live?!

Harry: {Shakes his head} Never!

Voldemort: Hh. Violence. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, do you want to see your mother and father again? We can all be brought back to them. {In the mirror, the faces of Harry’s parents appear.} What I’m looking for is something in return. {Harry takes a stone out of his pocket.} That's it, Harry. There is no right and wrong. There is only power, and those who want power. We’re going to do amazing things together. Just give him the stone! {Mom and Dad disappear.}

Harry: You liar!

Voldemort: Kill him!

Quirrell leaped into the air and punched Harry, one hand on Harry's throat. They fall on the floors. The stone fell from Harry's hand as Quirrell choked on it. Harry tenses up and shouts. Suddenly, Harry put his hand on Quirrell's and tried to pull it out. Smoke billows out from under his arms.

Queer: Ahhh! Ahhh! {Back. His hand is disintegrating into a mountain of black ash.} What is this magic? {Hands spread.}

Voldemort: Idiot! Take the stone!

Queer: {She goes forward, but Harry puts both hands on his face.} Ahhhhhhhh!

Quirrell backs away, then his face badly burns and expands as he walks forward. His whole body is covered in ashes. He falls to the ground. Harry gasps for air. He looks down at his own hands and hurries towards the stone. He picks it up and gets excited when he hears something. Turning, Harry saw Voldemort's face clouded over. The clouds are rushing forward toward Harry!

Voldemort: Arrhhhh!

Harry: Ahhhhh! {Voldum flies away. Harry fell to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in a dry hand.}

scene:

Hospital atmosphere. Harry was curled up and lying on the bed. He gets up, puts on his glasses, and sits up. There are gift cards and candy everywhere. Dumbledore approached him.

Dumbledore: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Signals from your fans?

Harry: Lovers?

Dumbledore: What happened on the bus between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so naturally the whole school knows about it. {Both smile.} Ahh, I'm your friend Ronald, thank you for the trouble of opening your port of chocolate.

Harry: Was Ronnie here? Is it normal? How about Hermione?
Dumbledore: Fine. They’re both good.

Harry: But what happened to the stone?

Dumbledore: Rest easy, little one. The stone is cracked. My friend Nicholas and I talked for a bit and agreed that it was good overall.

Harry: But Flamel, he’s going to die, isn’t he?

Dumbledore: {Sitting down on the bed.} He has plenty of Elixus to make things right. But yeah, he dies.

Harry: How did I get the stone, man? One minute I was looking in the mirror, the next…

Dumbledore: Oh! You see, only the person who wanted to find the stone, found it, but didn’t use it, could find it. It’s one of my best memories. And between you and me, that’s saying something. {You both laugh.}

Harry: Does that mean, once the stone is removed, I mean, that Voldemort can't come back?

Dumbledore: Oh, I'm afraid there are ways he could come back. Harry, do you know why Professor Queer couldn't let you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} Because of your mother. He sacrificed himself for you, and that act leaves a mark. {Harry touched his wound.} No, no, this kind of mark is impossible to see. It’s in your body.

Harry: What is that?

Dumbledore: Love, Harry, love. {She pats Harry's head and he wakes up.} A. All flavors of Bertie Bott’s beans. I was lucky enough to have a favorite Feng Shui as a kid, and I’ve never been a fan of them since. But I think I can be safe with good toffee...{Picks up the cabbage and eats it.} Mm. Oh! Earrings.

scene:

Harry approached a room where Hermione and Ron were talking in the shade of the staircase. They stop when they see Harry and turn to face Rimac.

Harry: All right, Ron?

Ronnie: Okay? you?

Harry: {shrug} Okay. Hermione?

Hermione: {laughs} Absolutely.

scene:

Only in the living room. The students are all seated, and green shapes on snakes surround the room.

Dumbledore at the head of the table nodded at McGonagall.

He clinked his glass and stopped talking. Dumbledore rose.

Dumbledore: Another year. And now, as I understand it, home cups are supposed to win prizes, and points are lowered accordingly. In fourth place, Griffin was 312 points. {quote. Harry and Hermione hid their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, 352 points. {Clapping.} In the second place, Ravenc, and 426 plates. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.

There are many festivals.

Student: Wow! Yes!

Draco: Alright, my friend! {She sees Ron looking at her and smiles.}

Dumbledore: Yes yes, well Slytherin, well Slytherin. However, new factors need to be considered. And I’m going to give me some last-minute details. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for brave actions when others were in grave danger, 50 pounds. {Explanation.}

Harry: {Patsy} Great job.

Dumbledore: Secondly, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for a good joke {Ron looks at Harry and says doors 'Me?' Harry tilted his head, and the doors said 'You!'} which is Hogwarts seeing these years...50 points. {Applause} And thirdly, to Mr. Harry Potter, for his generosity and kindness, I give 60 Griffield House points. {Great proud.}

Hermione: We're bonded to Slytherin!

Durham: And finally, it takes a lot of courage to face enemies, but a lot more to face your friends. I give Neville Longbottom 10 points.

There was a lot of screaming. Neville sits there in disbelief as the music gets louder. Draco had fallen.

Dumbledore: Assuming my calculations are correct, I believe the change of direction is approved. {Translation. The green flags change to the red and yellow of Gryffindor.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!

Congratulations.

Hagrid: Yeah! {laughs}

All the students stand and throw their hats in the air except for Draco, who smashes his on the table.

Simmons: Neville! {Shakes hand.}

Everyone is touching each other’s hair and jumping around screaming and laughing.

Lee: Yes! We won!! {She flies off with Harry looking behind her and smiling widely.}

scene:

Outside is the train station. Students walk into the train.

Hagrid: Come on now, quick. You'll be late. The train leaves. Go go. Go go. come on. hurry up.

Harry handed Hedwig to a train man and walked over to an open train door with Hermione. Hermione reached out to Hagrid, who reached out to her. Hermione got on the train.

Hermione: Come on, Harry.

Harry: One minute. {She walks by Hagrid.}

Hagrid: You thought you were leaving without saying a word, Dja? {Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and gives it to Harry.} This is for you.

Harry opened the album and saw a moving picture of himself as a child with his parents. They all smile and shake hands. Harry smiles.

Harry: Thank you, Hagrid. {She takes Hagrid's hand and kisses him deeply.}

Hagrid: Ohhh. Go…go with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if one of your uncles, Duddy, gave you a feeling you could always, uh, threaten him with a good excuse to go head-to-head with him.

Harry: But Hagrid, we're not supposed to be doing magic anywhere in Hogwarts. You know.

Hagrid: I know. But doesn't your cousin know? you? {chuckle} There you go.

Harry walks back to the train station where Hermione and Ron are waiting.

Hermione: Is it okay to go home?

Harry: I'm not going home. Not really.

The train whistles and they stagger inside the train. As the train pulls away and the camera goes wide, Harry waves out the window to Hagrid, who waves to the other students, and then the magic begins.

135 INT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - DAY 135

Harry and Ron, covered in muck and slime -- stand in
Dumbledore's office. Fawkes perches on a pedestal behind
Dumbledore, who sits at his desk, examining the charred
diary. He looks up, regarding Harry and Ron gravely.

DUMBLEDORE

Ingenious. Simply… ingenious.
(looking up)
Of course, Tom Riddle was probably
the most brilliant student
Hogwarts has ever been. I thought
him myself fifty years ago. After
he left, I would occasionally hear
stories of his activities -- dark
rumors -- but after a while, even
the rumors stopped. When he
finally resurfaced as Lord
Voldemort, most people had
completely forgotten the clever
Head Boy he'd once been.

GINNY

I didn't know whose diary it was,
sir. I swear. I found it inside
my cauldron.

Honestly, Ginny! What were you
thinking? Haven't I always told
you? Never trust anything that much
can think for yourself if you can't

Harry and Ron turned back. See Dumbledore regarding them
gravely.

DUMBLEDORE

You realize, of course, that
In the last few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school
rules?

HARRY/RON

Yes, sir.

DUMBLEDORE

And that there is enough
evidence to expel you both?

SPLASH!... a CARRIAGE WHEEL shatters the glassy surface
as we TILT UP, catch a procession of HORSELESS CARRIAGES,
carrying students toward the glimmering castle.
Gradually, the sweet sound of a CHOIR rises on the air, a
FLASH of LIGHTNING bleaches the night sky and we --

At the High Table, Lupine sits with SEVERUS SNAPE, MINERVA
McGONAGALL, RUBEUS HAGRID and ALBUS DUMBLEDORE. We TRACK
ALONG the FACES of the choir, singing to the strains of a
HARPSICHORD, and LAND ON a QUINTET OF TOADS (one of
which -- TREVOR -- belongs to NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, who
looks on with pride).
ARGUS FILCH, Hogwarts' caretaker, stands grimly to the
side and red-eyed MRS. NORRIS switches her tail at his
feet. As the choir's song concludes, DUMBLEDORE rises,
beaming over the sea of black hats.

Amid SCATTERED APPLAUSE, Harry, Ron, Hermione CLAP

Of course! That's why he knew to

DUMBLEDORE
As some of you may know, Professor

Finally, on more disquieting
note, Hogwarts -- at the request

A MURMUR of apprehension fills the hall. At the
Slytherin table, DRACO MALFOY, flanked by the ever

Harry Potter and the Captain of the Phoenix

I don’t know, it’s so hot today, isn’t it?

And it’s only getting worse.

Temperatures will hover in the mid-30s Celsius… that’s mid-90s Fahrenheit tomorrow, maybe even 100 degrees.

So, please, remember to mask up and stay cool.

Fuck your guys and go home.

Come on, love, get out.

Should we be?

Yes, we do.

I’ll make you your best dinner as a reward.

He howled like a pig, didn’t he?

Yes, good punch, Big Dee.

Did you see his face?

Hey, Big D.

I’m not afraid of my butt.

The world will change. -

I don’t understand. How do you know...?

Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.

Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?

Who are you-after killing that poor Duggar boy last year… did you expect him to let you go alone?

Good Lord man. They told me you were a genius.

Now go inside and stay.

Expect someone to reach out to you soon.

Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

Well, just look at her, Petina. Our son went yumpy.

This is what I’m going to take with you and your comments.

Mr. Potter;

what?

The Minister received word that tonight at 6:23... You made a patina charm in front of a mug.

As a violation of the Code of Expected Restrictions on Magic… You are expelled from… Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

I hope you’re well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

Professor Mead.

What are you doing here?

Saves you, of course.

But where are we going? The letter said I was fired.

You didn’t go there. not yet.

Kingsley, you took the floor.

But the letter said…

Dumbledore convinced the Minister to halt your expulsion…before the formal hearing.

Listening?

never mind. We will discuss everything when we get back to the board.

Not here, Nymphadora.

Don’t call me Nymphadora.

Stay connected, everyone. Don't lose if one of us is killed.

Come to your corner.

come on.

You go, baby.

No lights in sight.

Not death. There is no evidence.

He had almost killed Harry. If that’s not enough evidence…

Yeah, but you're safe - you know - what's most important...

We have to believe Dumbledore on this one.

Was she able to protect Harry all year?

Well, tonight I say it’s time for action.

Cornelius Federer is policy first and results second.

His idea would be to face her…

Keep your words low.

It’s getting stronger by the minute. We need to act now.

Harry.

Mrs. Weasel.

Heavens, you are all good.

I looked at him. They can’t just fire you.

That's not fair at all.

Yes.

There’s a lot of that going on these days.

So, what is this place?

It’s where he lives.

Phoenix Stadium.

It’s a secret society.

Dumbledore set him up when they fought who-knows-who.

I guess I couldn’t have included some of these in the letter?

I went all summer without any information.

We wanted to write, my friend. Indeed, we did.

just...

Just what?

Only Dumbledore swore we wouldn’t tell you anything.

Dumbledore said?

But why does he leave me in the dark? Maybe I can help.

I’m Voldemort coming back… I’m the one who fought him, the one who saw Cedric Diggory killed.

Harry.

I think we heard your dulcet tones.

Don’t bottle it though, my friend. Let her out.

If you’re all crying…

Do you want to listen to something you like?

If anyone is going to know, it's Harry. Without Harry… we wouldn’t have known that Voldemort was back.

He wasn't a kid, Molly.

But he’s also not a giant.

It's not James, Sirius.

Well, he’s not your son.

It’s as good as that.

Who else has seen it?

Hey Janie.

He grabbed me.

What a fatherly touch, black.

Potter would probably grow up to be a villain like his father.

Now, stay with this, tomorrow.

Is snap part of the mission?

Gut.

…for your holiday.

I know better.

So why not tell her?

Get out of it.

quick.

Get up.

Crookshank.

Stop it.

Get down you bloody cat.

Crookshank. Leave her alone.

Get up.

Hermione, I hate your cat.

Enemy Croxanks.

Well, we eat in the kitchen.

Just because you’re allowed to use magic now…doesn’t mean you have to beat your wands at everything.

Thank you, Mom.

Are you hungry, Harry?

Are you sure you're okay, Harry? He gave us plenty of time.

Harry Potter.

Sirius.

This is a very special case.

Apparently your hearing at the Ministry had to be in front of the entire Wizengamot.

I don’t understand. What has the Minister of Magic got against me?

Show him. He'll soon find out.

He also fights against Dumbledore.

Fudge uses all his powers, including his influence on The Prophet every day... to take down anyone who says the Dark Lord is back.

why?

He believes that Dumbledore is behind his actions.

No one could believe what they thought…

That exact spot. Fora doesn't remember.

He was transfixed by fear.

Now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry.

The last time Voldemort had the power… he nearly destroyed everything we held dear.

Now that he’s back, I’m afraid the Minister will do anything… to keep me from suffering that terrible loss.

We think Voldemort wants to rebuild his military.

Fourteen years ago, he had a lot of people.

Not just wizards and witches, but all kinds of dark creatures.

It took a lot of people and we tried to do the same.

But gathering followers isn’t the only thing he cares about.

We're sure... Voldemort might be after something.

Sirius.

Something he didn’t have last time.

You mean like a weapon?

No, that's enough. He’s just a boy.

You say a lot of words and you can put it into the computer.

Yes, but we should be…

Remember, during a listening session, speak only when spoken to.

Discipline hearing 12 August... into offenses committed by Henry James Potter... of Number 4 Private Drive, Little Wing, Surrey.

Interviewers: Cornelius Oswald Federer, Prime Minister...

Witness for defence.

Albus Percival Wolfric… Brian Dumbledore.

You got our message about the time and place... filled in?

I felt he deserved it.

But I got to the ministry three hours ago.

The charges?

The charges against the indictment are as follows:

"Oh, he knows that... and knowing the seriousness of his actions... he cast the Patronus Charm... on Miguel's face."

Would you ever cast a Patronus?

No, but...

And did you know that you’re prohibited from masturbating in school… under the age of 17?

Yes I was, but…

Wizards and Wizengamot Wizards…

I was doing it because of the democracies.

Democrats?

In little wings?

It’s a spiritual thing.

Can’t people see Demetrius, boy?

It’s very simple.

I'm not lying.

There were two, if I hadn’t done it…

enough.

Sorry to interrupt, I'm sure that would have been a standard story... but since you can't get witnesses in the case...

Excuse me, Minister, but it will be done as we can.

Please describe the attack.

What were they like?

Well, one of them was pretty big, one of them was pretty small.

Not men. Democrats.

Oh, sure, sure. Well, Mom.

cloth. Then everything went cold… like all the happiness had gone out of the world.

Now, look here. Dementors don’t just move into Miguel’s city gates… and become some sort of demon.

The odds are astronomical.

I don’t think anyone would believe it… The diners were there in unison, Minister.

I’m sure I misunderstood you, Professor.

The people are under the control of the Ministry of Magic.

And it's unfortunate for me, but it was like... You were saying that the Minister had taken action against this boy.

That would be truly annoying, Madame Seck... That's why I'm sure the Minister will set up an investigation... why the two Democrats were too late in Asian Cabin... and why they carried out an attack without permission.

Surely there’s someone… who might be behind this attack.

Cornelius, I beg you to reconsider.

The evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is undeniable.

He didn't return.

In the case of Harry Potter…

Rules can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.

It's so obvious. Has it become arrogant to commit all sorts of crimes... to solve a simple, impossible magical problem?

Those who want punishment?

who seek to impeach the accused on all charges against him?

He was cleared of all charges.

Teacher.

Padfour. Are you crying foul?

You blow the whole operation.

Sirius, what are you doing here? If someone sees you...

Should I have looked you up?

What’s life without a bit of risk?

I don’t want to send you back to Azkaban.

Don't worry about me.

Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

I’m surprised the department allows you to travel freely.

Better enjoy it while you can.

I remember a cell in Azkaban with your name on it.

What did I tell you? A complete nutter.

Just take care of me!

Only Malfoy.

What were you waiting for?

Thanks, guys.

Hey, Neville.

Hi Neville.

What is that?

What is what?

that. pulling the car over.

Nothing pulls the cart, Harry.

He pulls himself together, as always.

You're not going crazy.

I can see them too.

You’re as smart as I am.

Everyone this is Lynn Law…

Luna Lovegood.

It’s a good language.

It really is poetry.

It keeps the Nargels away.

hungry.

I hope the pod is there.

What is Nargle?

There is no memory.

Have a great afternoon, kids.

Currently, we have two staff changes this year.

We are pleased to welcome back Professor Grubble-Plank...who will be taking care of magical creatures...while Professor Hagrid is temporarily on vacation.

We also want to welcome back our newest Artist … Professor Dolores Umbridge.

And I’m sure you’ll all come with me to say hello to the teacher.

Now, as always, our host, Msgr.

Flowers asked me to remind you...

She was listening to me. He works for Fudge.

Thank you, Headmaster, for this wonderful run.

And how lovely it is to see all your glowing faces… the happy ones smiling at me.

I’m sure we’ll be great friends.

It can be done.

It can be done.

The Ministry of Magic has always been… very important to the education of young witches and wizards.

Although each principal…has brought something new to this historic school…progress for the sake of progress is to be disappointed.

Let’s protect what needs to be protected… and prohibit the practices that are prohibited.

Thank you Professor Ambridge.

It was indeed a great sight.

beam? Delicious waffle.

What does that mean?

Magic was banned in the past…

That means the Ministry is interfering at Hogwarts.

Dean, Seamus.

The best holiday?

all right.

Better than Seamus, anyway.

My mom doesn’t want me to go back this year.

why not?

I'll try. Because of you.

The Daily Prophet has said a lot about you and Dumbledore.

What, you believe that?

No one was there the night Cedric died.

I think you need to read the prophet on that, like your mother brain.

Don’t mention my mother.

Anyone who calls me a liar, I’m going to go at it.

What's going on?

It’s crazy, that’s what happens.

Do you believe all the garbage he took out about you-know-who?

Yes. I am.

Did anyone else have trouble with Harry?

Are you ok?

nice.

Seamus was going to be great, my friend.

But it’s coming, you’ll see.

I said I’m fine, Ronnie.

right. I’ll leave you to your thoughts then.

Harry.

Bring him here. Here.

Ohhh, go, Simus. Go get it.

Good morning kids.

Ordinary wizard-level tests.

Oo-LS.

called OWLs.

Study hard and you will be rewarded.

If you don’t, the consequences can be severe.

Your previous instructions on this topic;

But you’ll be happy to know that from now on… You’ll be following a carefully designed method of protection magic, approved by the Ministry. Yes?



Is there nothing here in the defense sources?

Are you using artwork?

Well, I can’t imagine why you would need to use them in my classroom.

Shall we not use magic?

You will learn how to make defensive options in a safe, risk-free manner.

What good is that? If we get bitten, it won’t be dangerous.

Students raise their hands when they speak in my class.

The Minister’s opinion is… that a little knowledge might be enough… to take you through your exams… after all, it’s school.

And how should science prepare us for what lies ahead?

There’s nothing out there, honey.

Who do you think wants to attack kids like you?

Oh, I don't know. It could be Lord Voldemort.

Now, let me make this very clear.

And you’re told… that a black wizard has been loosed once again.

This is a lie.

That's not a lie. I saw it. I fought for him.

Catch, Mr. Potter.

Cedric Diggory died of his own accord?

Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident.

It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

enough!

enough.

See you later, Mr. Potter. My office.

Let's come.

Goodnight, Mr. Potter.

sit.

You're going to have some lines for me today, Mr. Potter.

No, not without your paint.

I’m going to use my own special.

Now... I want you to write, "I don't tell lies."

How many times?

Well, let’s say how long it takes for the message to be received.

You didn’t give me any cream.

Oh, you won't need any ink.

Yes?

nothing.

That's it.

Because you know in your heart… you deserve to be compensated.

Wouldn't you, Mr. Potter?

Go go.

Skiffind food boxes.

Sugars that make you sick.

Leave the classroom whenever you want.

Enjoy a lot of simple, unproductive time.

Are you waiting for another one?

I’m not asking you to write it all down for me.

I was busy studying for these OWL exams.

I'm getting started. That's it.

Hermonie, you are the kindest person I have ever met.

And if I’m wrong for you again…

I know you’re back to normal.

What’s in your hand?

nothing.

with the other hand.

You have to tell the creator.

No.

Dumbledore was smart enough now.

I don't want to satisfy Umbrella.

Bloody hell, Harry. The woman is harassing you.

If only parents knew…

I didn’t get one of those, did I, Ron?

Harry, you have to see this.

It’s very simple. You’re becoming…

No, it’s not.

Hermione, whatever this is, it’s not easy.

You don't understand.

Then help us to.

Dear Padfoot… I hope you are well.

It’s starting to get cold here.

Winter is on the way now.

Even though I was back at Hogwarts, I felt more alone than ever.

I know you understand everyone.

Thank you, Harry Potter.

Your feet. Don’t they have a cold?

bit.

Unfortunately, my shoes were all gone from the shop.

I suspect Nargel is behind it.

What are they?

They are called testers.

They’re really good, but people reject them because they’re just too good…

different.

But why can't everyone else see them?

Only those who are mortal can see it.

So you knew someone who died then?

Mom.

She was an amazing wizard, but she loved experimenting… and one day, one of her spells went terribly wrong.

I was 9 years old.

I'm sorry.

Yeah, that was very cool.

I get very sad sometimes, but I have my dad.

We both believe in you.

That person not worth mentioning has returned, and you have rejected him… and the minister and the prophet agree with you.

thank you. You seem to be the only people doing it.

I don’t think that’s true.

But I think that’s the way he wants you to think.

what do you mean?

Well, if I’m you-know-who… I want you to compare yourself to everyone else… because if that’s you… you’re not the worst.

Are you going to stop eating?

what? I’m hungry.

Harry.

May I add to you?

Excuse me, Professor, but what do you really mean?

I just ask that when it comes to my students … that you follow established educational practices.

So I was flattered, but it’s like you’re questioning my authority in my own classroom… Miner.

Not at all, Dolores, just your medieval ways.

I’m sorry, Mom.

But to question my actions is to question the Minister… and the Minister himself.

I’m a patient woman… but the one thing I won’t stop at is unfaithfulness.

Disloyalty.

Things at Hogwarts are worse than I feared.

Cornelius wants to do something now.

What happened to Dumbledore?

She’s already made a change from… Liberal arts education through feudal affairs… Dolores Umbrella comes in, as a great wizard, she has the power… to deal with the monsters that fall from Hogwarts School.

Just one question, ma’am.

How long have you been on this post?

You first searched for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

Yes.

But you couldn't?

definitely.

Can you tell me something?

I'm sorry?

Move those doors.

A little prophet?

pity.

No, wait. Wait, no. I think I see something.

Yeah, I know. Something black.

You are in grave danger.

cute.

Cho. What's going on?

Professor Trelawney.

I lived and studied here for sixteen years.

Hogwarts is my home.

You can’t make this up.

Actually I can.

You want to make a point?

Oh, there are so many things I want to say.

there...

Professor McGonagall, may I ask you to escort Sybil inside?

Cybil, my mother. In this way.

thank you.

Dumbledore, I remind you that according to… Education Decree No. you have the right to dismiss my teachers.

But you can’t kick them out of the country.

This power remains with the principal.

now.

Isn’t there education you all have to do?

Teacher.

Teacher?

Professor Dumbledore. Teacher !

Professor Dumbledore.

It was bad, bad.

We don’t learn how to defend ourselves.

We don't learn how to pass our OWLs.

It’s taking over the whole school.

Safety is and will continue to be the Minister’s top priority.

Furthermore, we have solid evidence… that these disappearances are… the work of a known serial killer, Sirius Black.

Harry.

Sirius.

What are you doing here?

Reply to your letter.

You said you were worried about Amber. What does he do?

Training to kill half the race?

He does not allow us to practice magic at all.

Well, that doesn’t feed me.

One last bit of wisdom is that Fudge doesn’t want you to learn how to fight.

War?

What do you think, we’re going to form a magical team?

That’s what he thinks.

Dumbledore gathers his own forces against the Ministry.

It’s growing by the minute.

The others don’t want me to tell you this, Harry… but things aren’t going well with the Order.

Fudd blocks the truth from every angle… and how these disappearances used to begin.

Voldemort is on the move.

Well, what can we do?

Someone is coming.

I'm sorry I can't be of much help.

But now you feel like you’re on your own.

Is it really there?

We should be able to defend ourselves.

And when Amber runs away from us naturally, we need someone to do it.

Harry.

This is crazy. Who wants to teach me?

I'm nuts, remember?

Look at the face: you can't be worse than Old Soron's face.

Thanks, Ron.

I’m here for you, my friend.

Who should join us then?

Just two people.

Beautiful place.

I think it would be safe to drive on the paved road.

Matty, get back here.

Hi.

Then you know why we’re here.

We need a teacher.

Good teacher.

Someone who has gained experience in defending himself in religious arts.

why?

why?

Because you-baby-slave is back, you’re tosspot.

So he says.

Dumbledore said.

So Dumbledore said because he said.

The point is, where’s the evidence?

If only Potter could tell us more about how he killed Duggar…

I’m not going to talk about Cedric, so if that’s why you’re here, then look away now.

Come on, Hermione. They’re here because they think I’m a freak.

Is it true you can cast a Patronus Charm?

Yes.

I saw it.

Blime, Harry. I didn’t know you could do that.

And he killed a busboy with a gun in Dumbledore’s office.

It’s true.

The third year, he now fought over a hundred people.

Last year, he fought Who Knows You in the flesh.

wait.

Look, it’s all great when you say that… but the truth is, most of it was just bad luck.

I didn’t know what to do half the time. I always had help.

He's just being patient.

No, Hermione, I'm not.

Dealing with this kind of thing in real life isn’t like school.

In school, if you make a mistake, you can try again tomorrow.

But there… if you have a second to kill… or watch a friend die right in front of your eyes…

You don't know what that's like.

You’re right, Henry, we’re not.

That’s why we need your help.

Because if we’re going to have a chance to beat… Voldemort…

He is indeed back.

right. First, we need to find somewhere to play… where Umbridge won’t find out.

Shout out.

It’s very small.

Forbidden Forest?

It could be blood.

Harry, what happens if Amber finds out?

Who cares?

I mean, is that a rule-breaking thing?

Who are you and what have you done in Hermione?

Anyway, we all know one good thing that came out today.

What is that?

Cho couldn’t take his eyes off you, couldn’t take his eyes off you, could he?

right. Over the next few days, each of us should come up with… two possible places to train.

We need to make sure that wherever He is, He can find us.

I will, Harry.

All student groups are disbanded until then.

Any student who does not comply will be expelled .

Look where you’re going, Longboat.

You did it, Neville. You got the mandatory house.

What ?

Also known as bring and take home.

Compulsory housing only comes into play when one truly needs it.

and is always tailored to the researcher’s needs.

So let’s say you really need the bathroom…

Charming, Ronald. But, yeah, that’s the general idea.

It's nice. It’s like Hogwarts wants us to fight.

Expelliarmus.

I’m disappointed.

You fill your brush too much. Look at it like that. Expelliarmus.

Please copy the recommended text four times… to ensure maximum storage.

There will be no talking.

There’s no need to think like that.

Expelliarmus.

He's going.

Enchantment is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal.

It truly is a magician’s bread and butter.

So come on, then, Nigel.

Give it your best shot.

In the past!

good. Not bad at all, Nigel. well done.

never mind. I’m going to go easy on you.

Thank you, Ronald.

Come on, Ronnie.

Come on, Ronnie.

You can do it.

Come on, Ronnie.

One chicken.

You’re in it.

Steph.

thank you.

close.

I let him do that. Is that ethical?

That was the intention.

Come on. Would you like a cup of tea?

Now focus on a fixed point and try again.

Expelliarmus.

very good. Use your mind.

great.

It’s a little big.

I'm good. I'm good.

Steph.

Steph.

Those who want to join the wrestling team to earn more credits… can sign up at the office of the main wrestler.

It's annoying.

Working through adversity is important, but something equally important is believing in yourself.

Expelliarmus.

Levicorpus. got it.

Think about it this way.

The greatest achievement in history began… like nothing else for us now: the students.

If they can do it, why can’t we?

Steph.

Expelliarmus.

Expelliarmus.

Expelliarmus.

Redcott.

Expelliarmus.

Expelliarmus.

Expelliarmus.

Expelliarmus.

All right, Neville. Good job you man.

So that’s it for this tutorial.

Now we don’t see each other until after the holidays.

So keep practicing on your own as much as you can.

And all your good work. Good job, good job.

Good job my friend.

thank you.

See you after Christmas.

See you in the common room, Harry.

Thank you so much, Harry.

You don't have to worry.

thank you so much.

not at all. merry christmas.

Thanks Harry.

thank you. merry christmas.

merry christmas.

Have a Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas to you, Lynne.

We were thinking.

We could always rent out some passive picnic.

or fever. They give you huge puffs filled with pus…

Awesome guys. Will you excuse me?

Are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day.

Yes. I'm good.

Either way, it’s important.

This is all just education… it makes me wonder if I would have known…

Cedric knew about this.

It was really good.

That’s right, Voldemort was better.

You’re a good teacher, Harry.

I never noticed anything before.

For example.

It’s probably full of Narglers, though.

What is Nargalis?

There is no memory.

Well, how was it?

wet.

I mean, she was crying.

Isn’t that good enough for him?

I’m sure Harry’s kiss was a satisfying one.

Cho spends half his time crying these days.

You’d think a nap would make him happy.

Don’t you understand how he must think?

Well, obviously she’s sad about Cedric… and confused about Harry’s commitment, and guilty about being able to kiss him… fighter, because she might lose her mother to the Ministry… and she’s scared for her OWLs, because she’s worried about everything.

One person couldn’t hold it all together. They break down.

Because you’re about to have a heartbreak…

Harry.

Voldemort might be after something.

Something he didn’t have last time.

Harry.

Harry.

In the dream, you were standing next to the victim… or looking down at the scene?

neither. It was like I...

Are you going to tell me what’s going on?

Everard, Arthur is on watch tonight.

Make sure it was found by the right person.

Sir.

Phoenix.

You have to go to your photo in Grimmauld Place.

Tell them that Arthur Weasley has been seriously injured… His children will be there soon via Portugal.

They found it, Albert. It was close, but they thought he would make it.

Even worse, the Dark Lord couldn’t find it.

Oh thank God. Next, we need to…

Look at me!

What the hell is going on with me?

You wanted me to lead the school?

Oh, Severus. I’m afraid we can’t wait. Not until morning.

Otherwise, we’re doomed.

There seems to be a connection… between the Dark Lord’s mind and your own mind.

It’s unclear at this time if he was aware of this relationship.

Pray that he stays ignorant.

You mean if he knew, then... he could read my mind?

Read it, observe it… Stop it.

In the past, perhaps, it was the pleasure of the Dark Lord… entering his people’s minds… and creating visions designed to torture them into madness.

Only after letting out the last of the pain...when they begged for death, he killed them.

When used correctly, bond strength… helps you avoid contact or impact.

In these lessons I try to get into your mind.

You’re trying to get better.

Prepare yourself.

The rules.

Remember, Potter. focus.

Ho ho ho. merry christmas.

Here we go.

My father arrived.

Sit down, everybody, sit down. That's it. Now, the presents.

And a nice big box for Ron.

Big purse for you. and...

Fred and George. Come on, open up.

I want to see your faces.

Yes.

Try it out.

Thank you Mom. ``It's good.

It was exactly what he wanted.

Yes. right. Thank you Mom.

Come on, everyone.

Let's delete this.

Oh, Harry, Harry.

You're there.

Merry Christmas.

thank you.

It’s great to have you with us.

thank you.

Now, dad. Pass it on to my father.

thank you.

Has everyone won?

Fred? George?

Hermione.

Christmas toast.

To Mr. Harry Potter… otherwise I wouldn’t be here.

Harry.

Harry.

Harry.

That's great. I’m going to need some of that.

Father, don’t ever forget last Christmas.

I can’t understand why you wouldn’t want to wear it, Ronald.

That’s why I feel like an idiot.

No more than usual, Ron.

I don't know why...

The prodigal son stands there like a lion.

Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

Blood Friends of Clay and Blood Traitors.

If only my poor wife knew…

Kreacher!

This will make your suds appear. Stay away!

Of course, Master.

Kreacher lives and works in Black’s beautiful house.

Sorry about that.

It’s not very good, even for me as a guy.

Not for me, anyway.

What, you grew up here?

This is my parents’ house.

I gave it to Dumbledore as a binder.

The one important thing I was able to do.

This is Black’s family tree.

My confused cousin.

I hated most of them.

My parents and their pure blood.

My mother did this after I ran away.

Beautiful woman.

I was 16 years old.

Where did you go?

Reverse your father’s.

I was always welcome at Potter’s.

I see so much in you, Harry.

You guys are very close.

I don’t believe that.

Sirius, I was….

When I saw Mr. Weasley attack, I wasn’t just watching.

I was a snake.

And then, in Dumbledore's office... there was a moment when I wanted to.

I have this bond with Voldemort.

What if it was, should I ignore it?

I get angry all the time.

And if I was after all… Something broke inside me? What if I’m getting worse?

I want you to listen to me carefully, Harry.

You’re not a bad person.

You’re a good person to whom bad things happened.

Understand?

After all, the world isn’t divided into good guys and Death Eaters.

There is light and darkness within us.

What matters is where we choose to work.

It’s who we really are.

Harry, time to go.

When this is all over, we’ll be a normal family.

You'll try.

come on.

really?

Harry. Harry.

Hagrid's back.

I'm sorry.

I’m saying this one last time.

I’ll tell you where you were telling me.

I told you. I was there for my health.

Your health?

Yes. A cool breeze, you know.

Oh yeah. As a butcher, it’s hard to find fresh air.

If I was in your position, I wouldn’t be very used to going back.

In fact, it probably is.

This is a big secret, isn’t it?

Dumbledore sent me to speak to the people.

Giants?

Did you find them?

Well, they’re not that hard to find, to be honest. They’re huge, have you seen?

I tried to convince them they were worth the risk.

But I wasn’t the only one trying to find them.

Death Eaters?

Yes.

Trying to convince them to join You-Know-Who.

Did they?

I gave them Dumbledore’s letter.

Some of them probably remember him being friendly with them. I think.

And they did this to you?

Not exactly, no.

Oh, go on, you have it, so you bad dog.

It’s changing there.

Just like last time.

The storm is coming, Harry.

We’ll be ready if he does.

We have confirmed that 10 prisoners…early yesterday afternoon had escaped.

And of course, the prime minister was warned of danger.

We strongly suspect... that the explosion was planned... by a man who disguised himself as an escape from Azkabo... the cousin of the mass murderer Sirius Black... the cousin of the escapee Bellatrix Lestrand.

Dumbledore warned Fudge that this could happen.

He’s killing us all because he can’t face the truth.

Harry.

I wanted to apologize.

Now, even my mother says that the prophet’s experiences don’t add up.

So, what I really want to say is that I trust you.

Neville?

Fourteen years ago... a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange... used a cross curse on my parents.

He tortured them to get information… but they never gave up.

I feel very proud to be their son.

But I’m not sure I’m ready for everyone to know just yet.

We announce them, Neville. That’s the goal.

Make it the biggest memory in your mind, the happiest.

Let him kill you. Keep watching Sims.

George, speak now.

Wait for the patronom.

A complete Patronus body is harder to produce… but armor types can be equally effective against a variety of opponents.

And that was really good.

Awesome, Jenny.

Remember, your skate can only protect you if you take extra care.

So focus, Luna.

Think about the joy you can create.

Wait for the patronom.

I'll try.

I know. ``It's good.

This is advanced stuff, guys. You’re doing it right.

Wait for the patronom.

I will make short work of this.

Maximum bomb.

Find them.

I watch them for weeks.

And watch " Dumbledore's Army "... Proof of what I told you from the beginning, Cornelius.

All your fears about who-knows-who… didn’t ring true for a minute.

We saw your lies for what they were: a cynic in your attempt to usurp the Minister's office.

It’s natural.

No, Professor. He had nothing to do with it. I was.

The eldest among you, Harry, to protect me, but as I've said before... the palace wants to be clear that it's "Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

I told Harry to put this band together.

And I, and I alone, count his works.

Send an owl to the daily prophet.

If we are in a hurry, we should do morning delivery.

Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you leave Dublin... to Azkaban... to await trial for conspiracy and treason.

I think we can hit this little nugget.

It sounds like you’re operating under the assumption that I’m leaving…

What was the theme?

...Don't come so easily.

Well, I can tell you this: I have no intention of moving to Asia.

This is enough.

Take it away.

Well, you may not like it, Minister... but you can't complain... Dumbledore got a chance.

Boys and girls are not allowed to sit within eight feet of each other.

For those interested in joining the research team to earn more credit…

Students are asked about suspected crimes.

Any student who does not comply will be expelled.

Harry.

You’ve done everything you can. No one could win against this old woman.

Even the creator didn’t come up with this.

Henry, if it’s anyone else’s fault, it’s ours.

Yeah, we talked you into that.

Yes, but I agree.

I tried to help, and it turned out to be awful.

In any case, this is not always necessary.

Because I don’t want to play anymore.

All it does is make you care more.

And the longer you wait, the more you have to grow.

So maybe it’s best to.

To what?

To the one alone.

Hagrid.

Any idea where it takes us?

Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

I’ve never seen centaurs like this before.

And they are risky at the best of times.

The Ministry is severely limiting their land… They will have a complete revolution.

Hagrid, what's going on?

I’m sorry to be such a mystery to you three.

I won’t bother you with that, but with Dumbledore gone… I’d probably get a briefcase any day now.

And I can’t leave without telling someone about her.

Grope.

Down here, have fun.

Grope.

I have brought you a mission.

I just couldn’t get away from it because…

Because he’s my brother.

Blimey.

Well, big brother, really.

It’s harmless, like I said. Some kind of mental illness, that’s all.

Grap, that’s not honorable.

Hagrid, you did something.

We talked about this. You don't drink, do you?

That’s your new friend, Harmony.

Grope.

Graup.

Put me down.

now.

Are you ok?

nice.

It just needs a clean set of hands, that’s all.

I think you’ll find a lover.

Just stay away from him, okay?

He gets his own food and all.

She needs company when I’m gone.

Are you trying?

I am his only family.

Are you feeling comfortable?

That's specific.

Not for me.

And it will not please the Lord of Darkness if you do not change.

Every idea he gets is a weapon he can use against you.

You won’t last two seconds if you’re conscious.

You’re just like your father.

Lazy, arrogant.

Don’t say anything to my father.

weak.

I'm not weak.

Then reveal it.

Embrace your hearts.

Discipline your mind.

The rules.

Harry.

Sirius.

I could vomit.

Stop it.

Would you call it a control?

We’re at it for hours. If only I could just relax.

The Dark Lord is not at rest.

You and Black, you’re two people.

The kids whine all the time about your miserable lifestyle.

You may not think so, but life isn’t fair.

Your eternal Father knew that.

In fact, he watched her often.

My father is a great man.

Your father is a pig.

The rules.

Protego.

Come on, Mooney, Padfoot.

Snap. Expelliarmus.

Great, James.

dad.

Problem.

Fat Snowy. Fat Snowy.

right. Who wants to see me take off Snivel’s pants?

Fat Snowy. Fat Snowy.

enough.

enough.

Your lessons are over.

I...

Get out.

what's your name?

Michael.

Your hand looks great, Michael.

Yes. It’s not as bad as it sounds. find?

It’s already disappearing.

You can’t always see ours and the pain stops after a while.

Like I told you that one time, Mr. Potter… bad kids deserve punishment.

You know, George… I’ve always felt that our future lies in educational outcomes.

Fred, I was thinking the same thing.

All right, teacher!

You’re going to go here.

When you are ready.

I need that statement.

You should kill me.

Oh, I will. But first, you take it from me.

Crucio.

Crucio.

Sirius.

Harry, are you sure?

I saw it. It seems to be the case with Mr. Weisel.

This is the door I visited.

I can’t remember where I first saw it.

"Voldemort was after something," Sirius said.

Something he didn’t have last time, in the Secret Service.

Harry, please just listen.

What if Voldemort wanted you to see this?

What if he's just annoying Syrup because he's trying to get to you?

If so, what? Should I just let him die?

Hermione, she is family to me.

What are we doing?

We need to activate the Floo network.

The fire stations are under the watch of Ambridge.

Not all of them.

Alohomore.

Confirm the order if you can.

Are you sensitive? We’ll go with you.

It’s too much.

When are you going to come to your senses? We’re all in this together.

That’s you.

This one was caught trying to help the Weasley girl.

You were going to Dumbledore, right?

No.

A liar.

You called me headmaster?

Snape, yes.

It’s time for answers, whether he wants to give it to me or not.

Did you bring a wheelchair?

I’m afraid you’ve used all my stores to ask the students.

He ended up on Mrs. Chang.

Unless you want to poison him…

And I assure you, I’m very sympathetic if you do.

...I can't help you.

He has a pedometer.

He has a padlock in his hiding place.

Padfour? What is Padfour?

What is hidden where?

What is he talking about, Snap?

There is no memory.

It’s very good.

You don't give me any choice, Potter.

Since this is a Ministry safety matter... you'll leave me with... no other solution.

The curse of the cross should roll off your tongue.

This is illegal.

An unfamiliar crow will not harm him.

Tell him, Harry!

What did you tell me?

Well, if you don’t tell him where he is… I will.

What's where?

Dumbledore’s Secret Weapon.

How long?

Not far.

He had to be somewhere where the students wouldn’t find him in the act.

what are you doing?

Improvement.

good?

Where are these weapons?

There isn't one, is there?

You were fooling me.

You know... I'm so judgmental of kids.

You have no right here in Senate. This is about ministry.

Lower your weapons.

I warn you under the law.

Protego.

How do you stay strong?

Dirty half-breed.

Prison.

please. Please stop it. please.

For now, that's enough. I get the order.

You filthy animal.

Do you know who I am?

Leave her alone. It wasn't his fault.

No, she didn’t understand.

Potter, do something.

Tell them I’m not doing anything wrong.

I'm sorry, teacher.

But I don’t have to lie.

what are you doing?

I’m former Deputy Secretary Dolores Jane Ambridge.

Let me go!

Thank you Group.

Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

How did you get out?

Pastel Peak. It wasn’t good.

I told them I was hungry and wanted some sweets.

They told me to get out and eat myself.

That was great, Ronnie.

He knew he would.

It was awesome.

So how do we get to London?

Look, it’s not that I don’t love everything about you, y’all… but I’ve gotten you into a lot of trouble as it is.

Dumbledore’s army should be doing the right thing.

Or is that all just talk to you?

You may not have to do this all alone, my friend.

So how do we get to London?

We fly, of course.

Department of Secrets.

This is it.

Ninety-three.

Ninety-four.

Ninety-five (ninety-five).

He should be here.

Harry.

It has your name on it.

He who can face the Dark Lord draws near.

And the Dark Lord marks her as an ally... but the Dark Lord doesn't know, maybe she is.

for neither can live while the other lives.

Harry.

Where's Sirius?

You know you should know the difference between a dream and reality.

You are what the Dark Lord wanted you to be.

Now, tell me your story.

If you do something for us, I’ll break it.

He knows the game.

Eti, the little child.

Potter.

Bellatrix Lestrange.

Neville Longbottom, right? How about mom and dad?

Well, they’re going to get revenge.

Now, let's all just calm down... shall we?

That’s all we want.

Why did Voldemort need me to bring this?

Can you say his name?

You dirty half-blood!

It’s all good. He's just a boy scout, right?

Prophets can only be reached by those who are prophesied about.

Which is really important to you.

Haven’t you ever wondered… what was the nature of the relationship between you and the Dark Lord?

Why couldn’t he just kill you… when you were just a kid?

Don't you want to know your blood secret?

All the answers are right there in your hands.

All you have to do… is give it to me.

Then I can show you everything.

I lived for 14 years.

I know.

I guess I can be a little patient. now. Steph.

Steph.

Levicorpus.

Petrofucus Totalus.

Well done Neville.

Steph.

Steph.

Steph.

Steph.

Redcott.

Return to the door.

Department of Secrets. Did they get that one right?

Languages.

Can you guess what they’re saying?

No voice, Harry.

Let's get out of here.

I listen to them too.

Harry, it's a dead end.

Please, Harry.

Get out from behind me.

Were you so stupid and stupid as to think… that kids could be better than us?

I'll make this easy for you, Potter.

Prophesy to me now… or watch your friends die.

Don’t give it to him, Harry.

Stay away from the son of my Lord.

Now listen to me. Grab the others and get out of here.

what? No, I’ll stay with you.

You did the right thing.

Now, I'm going to take it off here.

black.

Expelliarmus!

Great, James.

Avad Kadafra.

No, no.

I killed Sirius Black.

Are you going to get me?

Crucio.

You should know what that means, Harry.

He killed her. And it deserves it.

You know, Harry.

Do it.

So weak.

It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom.

The Aurors are on their way.

Meanwhile I’ll be gone and you… will die.

You’re done, old man.

Harry.

So weak.

So crazy.

Look at me.

Harry, how different you are.

The way you're not.

Harry?

You are the weak one… you will never know love or friendship.

And I feel sorry for you.

You’re crazy, Harry Potter.

And you lose everything.

He’s back.

I know how you feel, Harry.

No, you don’t.

It's my fault.

No, the fault is mine.

I knew it was only a matter of time… before Voldemort made contact with you.

I feel like I’ve been as careful with you as I have been all year… It’s not going to get better, so you can be overprotective.

The prophet said.

"Neither can live while the other lives."

Which means one of us is going to kill one of them eventually.

Yes.

Why didn’t you tell me?

It’s the same reason you tried turning the cherry off.

It’s the same reason your friends saved you.

After all these years, after all your suffering… I don’t want to cause you any more pain.

I cared about you too much.

How come you're not in Celia?

I lost everything I owned. Apparently, people are hiding them.

That's good.

Oh, it's all good fun.

But as it’s the last night, I really need it.

Do you want help finding them?

I'm sorry about your father, Harry.

Are you sure you don't want any help?

That’s all good.

Anyway, my mother always said… the things we lose come back to us in the end.

It’s not always what we expect.

Guess I’m going to eat a pudding.

I was thinking about something I was told.

What is that?

That even though there's a war ahead of us... We've got one thing Voldemort doesn't have.

Yes?

Something worth fighting for.

               You have to play.

     Snape smiles slightly, bringing the cup to his lips.

               Do you mean it, Severus?

                              snap;

               Give the previous oath.
                    (As Snape looks straight in)
               Try it out. It's an empty statement.
               Oh, he's trying. She gives him hers.
               Good effort. But if it’s important

                I told you. I don’t know, I
                saw.

      Harry stood up and grabbed the cloak from Ron.

                              Harry
                I need some fresh air.


30 Ann. The Hogwarts Express - Street - Night (after hours) 30

      The blood-red sun shone through the windows.
      The inside is a deep red. Students play literacy cards.
      In the same kitchen, CRABBE and GOYLE are awkwardly sleeping.
      As Harry entered, the accordion doors led to the next car.
      The SQUALL is opened and a PAIR of TWIN GIRLS appears. Looking forward
      They see if a voice comes back, e.g.

      Darkness falls and the red light of evening returns.

                              Malfoy
                What just happened? Blaise?

                     (self-corrected)
                I don't know.

      Just then, a small bag pops up... then falls out

                Relax, boys. The lights went out.
                That's all. Come on, Draco. We will be                           
                In Hogwarts before you know it.

      Pansy, giving Draco's locks a light circle, stopped him.

                What does that mean?

                              Malfoy
                Let’s just say I think
                You'll see me in my mess.
                in time at Charlotte Island next year.

      Confused, Pansy looked Blaze in the eye, who was smiling.

                              Malfoy
                Funny, Blaze? We'll just see.
                Which is laughable in the end.

      Blaze shook his head, smiled and rolled his eyes.
      at the window in the darkness. That's when the small bag is

33 EXT. Cake - Night/Day 33

      The Hogwarts Express rumbled through the station.


34 Anne. Hogwarts Express - Single Season - Night/Day 34

      Ron and Hermione stepped into the crowded street.

                                 Hermione
                Where's Harry?

                              Ron

      Malfoy closed the door. Take down the blinds. a

                              Malfoy
                Did my mother ever tell you that
                Good manners to listen to, Potter?
                Petrifucus Totalis!
      Malfoy wheels around, pointing his wand at the cargo door.
      Something is down with a THUMP. Invisible

                              Malfoy

      Malfoy brought his boot down on Harry's face. draw!
      Blood gushes from Henry's nose. Malfoy said.
      The Invisible Cloak stared at Harry.

                              Malfoy
                Enjoy the trip to London.


36 EXT. Cake-Night (Several Hours Later) 36
      Malfoy walked out, squeezed his wand and disappeared.
      Into the night. Softly, a voice calls out, from a girl in a hurry
      Hmmm and we --

                                                          Cut to:

                they.


39 EXT. Hogwarts Castle - Steps Forward - Night (Late) 39

      The castle is shining. Harry, his face swollen with blood, his nose.
      Just in the middle, it gets closer with a line.

                              Harry
                I’m sorry I missed you.
                Cars, Luna.

                              Luna
                It's good. I loved our walk.
                It was like visiting a friend.

                              Harry
                I’m your friend, Lynn.

                                Luna
                That's good.

      It was then that Professor Flitwick ran out and grabbed her.
      Long PARCHMENT roll bearing each student’s name.

                              Flitwick
                Just in time! I tried it all.
                For both of you. Names.

                              Harry
                Professor Flitwick, you got it.
                I’m five years old.

                              Flitwick
                No exception, Potter.

                              Luna
                Who are those people?

      Harry turned to see Lonnie, where he was staring into the darkness.
      SHADOWS ride like ghosts.

                               Flitwick
                Aurors. For security reasons.

                              Malvoy (OS)
                It's not a shit, you create.
                It’s a walking stick.

      Harry and Luna shifted. Draco stood in the middle of the mountain.

                              snap;
                It was his father's.

      Snap distinguishes the shades. Draco closed his eyes.
      Then she puts the butter in the flower.

                              Malfoy
                It’s my father’s. He didn’t die.
      Snape looks at Malfoy and wraps the wand in the cloth;
      and put him in his box.

                              snap;
                All right, Mr. Phillips. I can
                Consider Mr. Melfio.
      Draco watched Snape carefully again, then lowered himself;
      He holds Harry up and looks at him.

                              Malfoy
                Pretty face Potter.

      Harry put a hand to his mouth and watched Malfoy disappear.
      Into the darkness, Snape follows.

                              Luna
                Do you want me to fix it?
                Personally, I think you look like
                Many enemies can be so powerful. but
                That’s up to you.

                              Harry
                Have you created one? The nose.

                               Luna
                 No, but I did a lot of leg
                 And how are they different?

       It's not that Harry is filled with faith.
       nevertheless...

                                  Harry
                 What the hell. Try it out.

                                Luna
                Episco.
      Luna puts her wand on Harry's nose and... gives it to him
      beat. It shakes violently and then… SNAPS into place.

                                Harry
                good? How do I look?

                              Luna
                And it’s just an exception.

                                Harry
                brilliant.


40 Ann. Big House - Night (sometimes later) 40
      Hermione arched her neck and glared at Harry, while Ron
      She fills her face with pudding, MUMBLING, MOUTH FULL:

                It seems to have gone away this time.

                              Hermione
                     (As it comes)
                Where have you been Harry? and
                What happened to your face?

      That’s when the light in the room starts to slowly get harsher and
      All eyes are on Dumbledore standing overhead

      The clouds respond to his signal and complete the glow.

      MILD APPLAUSE follows. Harry applauds his

      This is greeted by stunned silence. Dumbledore frowned.

                 Once upon a time, there was a man who,

      The hall fell silent.

                Just a few things to keep in mind.
                Now, go for a walk. Peep peep!

                              Ron
                     (as they rise)
                That was great.

41 Ant. Corridor - 41st Morning

      Many students struggle to attend school
      The first day of the season. In the midst of all this, McGonagall is standing.
      And later. The twins pass, they look exactly the same.
      Anxiety.

                              Professor McGonagall
                The history of magic is over, ladies;
                Not the bottom. Mr. Davis -- That's right.
                The girl’s bathroom…

      McGonagall's eyes shifted, and Harry and Ron were sitting on her.
      a ledge, which is obviously more enjoyable from
      chaos.

                                Professor McGonagall
                Potter!

      Harry's smile faded. McGonagall gestured with a finger.

                              Harry
                This can't be good.

      Ron smiles as Harry makes his way "upstairs" to
      McGonagall.

                              Professor McGonagall
                Are we celebrating ourselves?

                              Harry
                Well, you see, I got an opening.

                example.
      Ms. Cole began speaking, then shaking her head and moving

      representing a seafloor zone characterized by OUTCROPPING SHARP ROCK and

      New Angle - The passageway outside Tom Riddle's cabin.

      Mrs. Cole's hand comes out. Gosh. He turns the KNOB.


48 Ann. Farmhouse - Riddle House - Pension - $48

      Small room, heavy and shady. Tom Riddle, 11 years old               
      Old man, sitting on the bed with hands on hips. The walls are plastered with           
      REFLECTED RAIN pours out like oil through a dirty window.               

                               mrs. Cole
                 You’ve got a visitor, Tom.


      Dumbledore stepped forward and held out his hand.

                              Dumbledore
                How you do it, Tom.

      Riddle glares at Dumbledore for a moment, then winks.

                              mrs. Cole
                Well, I'll leave you two.
                For yourself.

      Mrs. Cole leaves and closes the door. Dumbledore studies.
      Riddle, then, starts looking around the house. By carefully putting it down.
      THERE are some souvenirs on a treetop. A group of
      SEVEN STONES… A book containing some stones. seven
      The keys to the ship...
      Moving forward, Dumbledore went through a long list, tracing
      There were fingers on the outside, like a tree seed.
      Briley, as it were, somehow "sees" what's inside.

      Dumbledore then stopped him. Spread out on a small table.
      A group of dark images. A man and a woman, their
      The faces are tortured. A CAVE formed out of the sea. The same bracket is removed.
      That picture. Dumbledore reached out…

                                 Tom Riddle
                not.

      Dumbledore stopped and turned around. He looks into Riddle's eyes.
      she.

                                 Dumbledore
                as you wish.

      Riddle makes eye contact with Dumbledore for the first time
      He extends his hands. They are widespread, and
      INTERLACEED WITH THE SILKY WEB WHERE THE SPIDER IS BEHIND
      And go.

                              Tom Riddle
                You’re the doctor, right?

                               Dumbledore
                No, I’m a teacher.

                              Tom Riddle
                I don’t believe you. I hear the woman.
                Cole speaks, he and the others.
                employees. They want me to watch.
                in. They think I don’t exist.

                              Dumbledore
                Maybe they’re right.

                                 Tom Riddle
                I'm not crazy.

                              Dumbledore
                Hogwarts is not a mad place
                people.

      Riddle looks up and slowly lifts his head.

                                 Dumbledore
                It’s school. A school...
                Magic.

      Riddle continues to stare but says nothing.

                              Dumbledore
                Things you can do that you can’t, Tom?
                Things other kids can’t do.

      Riddle glares at Dumbledore, not looking away.

                                 Tom Riddle
                Yes.

                              Dumbledore
                Can you tell me something?
                Do it, Tom.

                               Tom Riddle
                      (See Spider-Man).
                I can move things -- with
                touching them. I can draw animals.
                Do what I want without having to train.
                they. I can do terrible things.
                It happens to normal people
                I. I can abuse them… if I
                want.

      Dumbledore studies Riddle -- and then the boy looks up.

                                 Tom Riddle
                who are you?

                              Dumbledore
                I'm like Tom. different.

      Riddle closes his hands and breaks the net.

                                 Tom Riddle
                You have shown it.

      That’s not the question. Although his eyes weren’t broken.
      Dumbledore's eyes narrowed slightly and...
      WARDROBE is destroyed in fire. The Wheel Puzzle.

       She smiles softly. Dumbledore reads it. Surprisingly.
       The garage begins to shake. Riddle's smile disappears.

                              Dumbledore
                I think something is being watched.
                From your wardrobe, Tom.
                Open it. open. it.

      Horrified, Riddle went to the burning clothesline and
      opening the door. Upstairs, above the railroad tracks.
      In the soiled clothes, a small fragrance vibrates violently.

                               Dumbledore
                Take it out.

      When Riddle's fingers touched the box, it caught fire.
      The wardrobe is gone, but the box rocks.
      was the only sound in the otherwise silent room.

                              Dumbledore
                Is there anything in this book you
                Shouldn’t have?

      Riddle looks back at Dumbledore, who is horrified this time. he
      He drops the box on the bed: Yo-yo, Silvermark;
      and a dirty MOUTH ORGAN.

                              Dumbledore
                Why did you want these products?
                Tom?

                              Tom Riddle
                     (To be reviewed)
                I like to have things that are unique to me.
                To other people. It makes me feel better.
                … Approach them.

      Dumbledore studies Riddle's profile and thinks about it.
                              Dumbledore
                Stealing will not be allowed.

                understood?
                     (As Riddle nods)

      As Dumbledore begins to leave:

                              Tom Riddle
                I can talk to snakes too.

      Dumbledore ordered, we're on his face, his back.
      A puzzle.
                                                        
                              Tom Riddle
                They get me. Talk about things. is
                That simple. For someone like me?

                                 Dumbledore

      Dumbledore then walked out, looked behind him, and walked out.
      11-year-old Tom Riddle, alone. The image vibrates and.

                Do you know, sir? then?

                              Dumbledore
                Did I know I was just dating
                The most dangerous dark wizard of all.
                period? No. If I...

      Dumbledore hesitates, a worried look on his face. Harry looks on.
      From Pennsylvania, where young Tom Riddle was torn to shreds.
      A face floats out, eyes Dumbledore.

                              Dumbledore
                Over time, while here at Hogwarts,
                Tom Riddle came close to one.
                Special teacher. You can think
                What teacher could that be?
                              Harry
                Don't bring a teacher.
                Slughorn returns only to read.

                              Dumbledore
                No, I didn’t. Look,
                Professor Slogar will
                It’s something I really enjoy.
                He never leaves.

                     (looking at Harry
                      with knowledge)
                I wish I didn't have to say anything more.
                Now, Harry. But I make promises.
                In time you will know everything.


                              Harry
                You said Professor Slughorn would
                Try to get me together.

                                 Dumbledore
                I did.

                              Harry
                Do you want me to drop it?

      Dumbledore traced his dusty fingers.
      Pensive, to the young face of Tom Riddle.

                                 Dumbledore
                Yes.

50 EXT. Quidditch - 50am

      Harry tried -- unsuccessfully -- to get
      Attention Aspiring Quidditch Players
      They are all gathered in the square.

                               Harry

      Silence immediately. Harry frowned, nodding at Ginny.
      nevertheless.

                              Harry
                thank you. all right. This morning.

                Alright?

      Cormac gives her a nasty look, and walks away. Ron rolled his eyes.

                Is the relationship low?
      She makes another drink, but Harry clearly catches her.
      Then Ginny appears in her arms.

                And I don’t sleep.

                Yes. right.

      When Hermione started to struggle:

                              Hagrid
                You three!

      Hagrid emerged from the trees, wearing a white bonnet.
      He’s like crazy Father Christmas. Beyond, deep.
      In the forest, dark figures -- AURORS -- can be seen.
      Hermione blinks for a moment, then nods her head.

                              Hermione

      Hagrid opened the bag. These three are interchangeable. Hagrid

                you?

                              Hagrid
                It's not for me. It’s Aragog.

                That arachnid tried to eat

      Ron saw Hermione glaring at the Aurors again.

                              Hermione
                Aurors. I know they are here.
                To protect us though… somehow I
                Don’t feel safe anymore.

      It was then Harry looked back at Sluggar
      village, passing a tired Flitwick and coming the other way.

      When the three entered, Harry looked up to find Slughorn
      At the bar, he is restricted to a seat.

                               Harry
                Not here.

      Hermione and Ron were sitting somewhere.

      Slogography. They exchange glances, raising eyebrows, including Harry's.
      Ron started to take the seat in front of Harry --
      Close his vision.

                               Harry
                No, no. Sit next to me.

      Ron stopped, exchanging another look with Hermione.

                               Ron
                ok.

      A small child jumps out of a mop and throws a dirty laundry
      On the table -- which starts clearing space on it

      Slughorn is in the spotlight.

                Mine has ginger, please.

      The child whistles and the collar flies out of his pocket.
      Harry kept his eyes on Slughorn when he saw Draco.
      They lock eyes for a moment and then Draco appears.

                              Ron
                Oh bloody hell...

      Harry turned and saw Ron glaring at Ginny, who was sitting.
      In the dark corner with Dean, their faces lit by a tube.

                              Hermione

                 And the sango.

                              Ron
                I want to go.

                               Hermione
                leave? You can’t be honest.

                              Ron
                That would be my sister.

                              Hermione

                And you looked at me? would
                You wait for him to wake up and

      Ron blinks, unable to speak. then:

                Harry, my husband!
      Sluggar's voice BOOMS louder and louder, even as Ginny flies -- and
      He holds Harry up and looks at him. As Slughorn stirred,
      SLOSHING Crow in hand Harry woke up now -- and
      An act so out of character that Hermione notices
      with sarcastic questions.

                               Harry
                Thank you, master. Great to see you.

      Hermione, rolling her eyes, turned to Ron and said quietly:
      Nice to see you?
                              Harry
                So what brings you here, man?

                              Slang
                Oh, I'm going with three flowers.
                Back road. Longer than I wanted.
                agree. In fact, I remember when
                It was the same juice!

      as Slughorn GUFFAWS, Harry added, laughing heartily as
      good. Slughorn's stomach lurched next to Hermione's cheek.
      And his steaming cup smashes the table.

                Oh! All hands on deck, Granger!

      Ron frowned as Slughorn walked away, turning to Harry.

                What are you playing at?

      A scowl took over Slughorn's face and he turned around.

      Harry has a serious talk with Lupine, Tonks, and

                              Harry
                Drake is planning something I know.
                Well, something to do with
                Voldemort. He was offered a job.
                Or company -- and Snap had

                              Harry
                I know that sounds crazy --

                              Lupine
                Has that occurred to you, Henry?

                You trust Dumbledore’s judgment.
                He trusts Snape. Therefore, I do it.

                              Harry
                But Dumbledore could be wrong.
                He said to himself --
                              Lupine
                You are blinded by hatred.

                              Harry

      The window behind Harry glows red with light.
      Ginny's eyes then move from Harry to the trees.

                                Janie
                Oh my god...

      The flames race up the stairs, climbing the walls
      home. Lupine drew his wand and ran after Harry.

                                Tonks
                Remus!

      Ron, Fred, and George appear, and join Arthur in fleeing.
      Towards the neighborhood. Arthur looked at Ginny.
      It comes out.

                              Mr.R. Weasley
                Jenny, stay with your mother!

      He runs through the grass without hesitation.

84 hours. Red (around the burrow) - Night (some time later) 84

      Harry looked out into the air, the grass shining brighter.
      Then he notices Bellatrix. He smiles and looks crazy.
      wood nymph, then flies away, her laughter mocking him. as
      He looks for it, FIRE SNAKES across the grass towards him.


      A new angle.

      Fred, George, Ronnie, and Arthur all escape
      Their feet raise SPARKS like destructive SHADOWS
      of all the smiles. It’s like hunting ghosts.


      A new angle.
      Ginny, with shining hair, runs through the grass.

      Bellatrix leads Harry with a crazy grin.

      Ginny comes to a stop, her chest heaving as she watches.
      Towards the neighborhood. A bigger picture is shaking.
      and aged smoke. Ginny's eyes shift, watching Bellatrix run
      Go forward by the offices, then hold SHIFT as you do.
      The smoke clears, revealing… Greyback. Bellatrix has
      A clicking sound like a dream -- and Greyback
      He steps forward, clearing the grass in front of him
      And to be honest…

      … Harry went ahead.

                                  Janie
                   No, Harry! It’s a picture!
      Harry turns to look at Ginny's voice and the Jada's.
      Greebeck. Bellatrix is dead, wheels on her tracks.
      And, looking at Jenny, SHRIEKS with RAGE. His stick lifted.
      It sends out a red light that explodes in the shower
      SPARKS around Ginny. Ginny then opens fire.
      Avoid him, flash through the running lanes and come face to face.
      and...

      The fake teeth are shiny.

                                 Greyback
                   Don't you smell clean?

      Just then, a BOLT OF BLUE was fired from Greybeak's back and
      He turned to see Harry standing several feet away. as
      Greyback gives chase, Ginny gives chase, and we’re back.
      And right between Harry, Ginny and the Beast

        Dumbledore looks into the eyes, his eyes distant. Harry looks on.
        He made sense, as leaders do in their frames
        above. Finally, Harry speaks.

                                Harry

        That’s when Harry’s fingernails glow come into contact with
        With the shield, the images sparkle in a DIZZYY way:
        VOLDEMORT's face twisted in pain. An abandoned house,
        Deep in a dark place. An old cup that shines like

        She walks over to Dumbledore's desk and Harry comes over with a hand.
        to his chest, a confused look on his face.
        Dumbledore looks at the ring and scrolls down, then looks up.
        Harry slowly reached out, squeezing lightly.
        Harry's medium chest and blond hair.

                  Isn't that right? If you leave

        Harry's eyes travel once to the postcard that
        desk. Dumbledore reached out, still shaking his head.
        Reading Harry strangely, his voice, when it comes, is distant.

        Harry looked at Dumbledore. Dumbledore cocked his head.

                  Once again, I'm looking for more.

        Harry looked back at Ron and Hermione, neither of them.

        She continues on.

120 hours. Tower of Space - Dying Light (Late) 120

        Harry was walking down the stairs outside when he heard the
        voices from above and standing down to watch
        Upstairs in the lattice-like structure: Dumbledore and
        Snap.

                                snap;

                  This was agreed upon. There is nothing to

        Harry stopped and looked up to see Dumbledore.

        As his FOOTSTEPS fade, Harry ascends to the ceiling.
        Dumbledore turned around. Smile.

                  Harry. You need a root, I
                  friend.

        Harry ran his hand over his face.

                                 Dumbledore
                  Sometimes I forget how much you
                  respected. Sometimes I'm even
                  The little boy in the pillowcase.
                       (laughs)
                  I'm sorry, Harry. I
                  I’m an old man.

                                Harry
                  You get me too man.

        Dumbledore then turned away and looked up at the fire in the sky again.

                  promise. But there is an exception .
                  Condition: You must follow all instructions.
                  I instruct you -- with
                  question.

                                 Harry
                  Yes man.
                                Dumbledore
                  Please understand what I am telling you.
                  I'm telling you to shut up.
                  It needs to be hidden.

        Harry shook his head.                                                       

                                Dumbledore
                  If I tell you to run, you                      
                  ride.

        Harry shook his head.                                                       

                                Dumbledore
                  And I have to tell you to drop                        
                  Me and save yourself…

        Harry's eyes flicked up to meet Dumbledore's.                             
                                Dumbledore                                
                  You do that.                                         

        Harry hesitates.

                                Dumbledore
                  Your voice, Harry.

        Harry internally chews this over, then nods.               

                                 Harry
                  My word.

                                 Dumbledore

                  There it is. One more question.
                  How do we get there?

                                Harry
                  We just couldn’t watch.

        In eerie silence, the boat cuts across the water and goes.
        Harry and Dumbledore walked towards the green light.

                                Dumbledore

        Dumbledore dipped the cup in the sparkling water and
        It comes with the doors. He drinks deeply. He closes his eyes.

                                   Harry

        Harry eyed Dumbledore's angry face and busied himself.

                                Harry

        Harry brought the cup over again. Dumbledore drinks.

                  I didn't say anything.
                  You, yourself, Draco?

        Draco relaxes Dumbledore's eyes.

                                Dumbledore
                  You're not a killer, Draco.
                                Malfoy
                  How do you know who I am? I am
                  Things that inspire you.

                                Dumbledore
                  Like cursing Katie Belle and hoping
                  He'll be damned.
                  Speak for me? Like replacing the
                  One med bottle attached.
                  poison. Forgive me, Draco, but.
                  These are killer targets I
                  I can’t ask if yo
                  They really had heart.
                  I'm curious. When Voldemort
                  When you applied for the job, he interviewed you
                  To kill me, was it a whisper?

                                   Malfoy
                  Depends on me! I’ve been chosen!

        Malvoy reached back and pulled on his glove and
        It shows DARK MARK. Dumbledore doesn't look at him.

                                Dumbledore
                  Then I will make it easy for you.

        Slowly and without warning, Dumbledore slowly withdrew his wand.           
        Immediately Malfoy pushed himself up.                                

                                   Malfoy                               
                                                                        
                  Expeliarum!
        Harry is afraid of Dumbledore's wand flying free;        
        clattering across the grid above. Malfoy looks at him.        
        Standing in a mixture of fear and terror itself         
        Actions. Dumbledore glances at the wand, then at Draco.                  

                               Dumbledore
                 Good job Draco. But I warn you.                    
                 Killing is not as easy as that.

                  Made all the wrong choices. let
                  I'll help you Draco.

                                Malfoy

                  find! I have to do it! I have to!

                  I.

                                Dumbledore
                  Say that again, Draco. But loud
                  At this time.

        Draco stares into Dumbledore's eyes. His hand
        It's shaking. Harry watches her from the shadows.
        Slowly, Malfoy began to lower his wand… when FOOTSTEPS
        Echo. The door opens: Bellatrix, Greyback, and
        some.

                                Bellatrix
                  Okay, now, look what we have here.

                   Done, Draco.

        Harry looked back, his eyes glowing with anger.
        On Bellatrix. He slowly pulls out his cane.

                                Dumbledore
                  Good night, Bellatrix. I think
                  The beginnings are balanced.

                                Bellatrix
                  Albert loves it. But I'm scared.

                  Do it.
        Malfoy's wand went up once more. Harry called himself.
        He decided to go to the grid , poised. Just then, a shadow
        splinters across the tracks to his right. He looks,
        He finds Snap, still as a ghost, looking up.
        Snape drew his wand carefully and then turned to Harry.
        Finger to lips: Shh. Then he continues upstairs.
        silent. The demon again.

                  No! The Dark Lord is clear. that
                  The man has to do it. Go, Draco.
                  now!
        Darko raised his wand again, his hand trembling.
        Harry's own hand was now dry. The blood vessel in his arm.
        It smells...

                                Snap (OS)
                  No.

        Harry watches Snap come INTO VIEW.

         Draco, in surprise, stared at the empty space where
         Dumbledore stopped only a few seconds ago. Snap delivers.

        Snape glared at Harry and then turned to walk away.
        Harry frowned and pulled himself to his feet and looked for one.
        One last time.

                  Snape was doing too much.

        Hagrid then turned around and saw several students and
        STAFF gathered inside the castle.

         He runs the back of his hand easily over the exposed surface

         Then he noticed something next to Dumbledore's ashes.
         Hand: Loki. He takes it, and he considers it bad.

        It's disgusting. Harry put the wand back on her slightly.               
        The desk, retracing his steps toward the door, pauses.           
        see.

        Harry turned and wordlessly studied the painted face.                 
        essential. At a loss, he finished quietly:

                   You meant so much to him.

        Harry shook his head, sighed one last time, and left.

142 hours. Space Tower - 142 days

         Harry and Hermione stood against the walls while Ron and             
         Ginny stood a few feet away, out of earshot. Harry              
         He watches Hagrid's ashes in the distance.
         Hermione plays with Loki in front of them.                         

                                 Hermione                                   
                   Do you think he would have?
                   "Draco?"

                                 Hermione                                   
                   strange. I think this is something                        
                   Voldemort and…

                                    Harry
                   Yeah amazing. Only... it's not.                     
                   It's a scam.                                             

         As soon as Hermione answered, Harry turned his head.

        Hermione opened the drawer and took out some           
        PARCHMENT wrapped in a heavy frame. Read:

                                Harry
                  I don't know. But whoever they are, they
                  It's a real Horcrux. which
                  That means inheritance. All of that.

        Hermione studied Harry's tense expression, then looked away.         
        Jenny and Ron.                                                  

                                Hermione                                
                  Ronnie is good at it, you know. you

        Hermione smiles a little and tries to cheer him up, but Harry         
        He just nods and looks away again.                                  

                                Harry
                  I won't go back, Hermione.                        
        Hermione shook her head.                                                  

                                Hermione                                
                  We figured it out -- Ronnie and me.                            

                                Harry
                  I must finish Dumbledore's story.

                  That leaves me... but I'll let you                      
                  And Ron knows where I am -- when I

                  I have always loved your kindness.

        Harry turned and looked at her in surprise.                        

                                Hermione
                  You honestly don’t think you can.

                  You need us, Harry.
        Harry just stares at him. She lifts her head and smiles.          
        He’s doing everything to get someone out of him. Finally, she did,        
        In short.                                                        

                                Harry                                   
                  Yes. I am. But do me a favor.

        Hermione was stunned. The reds.                              

                                Hermione                                
                  Like that’s going to happen.                          

        He looks at Ron and shakes his head.                            

                                Hermione                                
                  Besides, she's screaming.                                

                                Harry                                   
                  Funny, he says the same thing about you.                    

                                Hermione                                
                  Yes, but I was forgotten.                            
                  Understanding.                                           
                                Harry                                   
                  You’re smart. Just both of you.                       

        Harry looked away again and Hermione followed his gaze. it        
        He looks around. It slowly destroys itself. we

                                Hermione                                
                  Do you think we will... (come

                                  Harry
                  I don’t know.                                        

        Hermione shook her head and Harry's eyes widened, looking at Ron and         
        Jenny. As if recognizing the look on her face, Ron turned and they              
        An exchange of light, something unspoken but true to the past.           
        between them.                                                  

        It was then that a heartbreaking and stirring song rose on the air.      
        And seconds later, a bird flies out             
        The tallest building started to cross his path.

        Ron and Ginny walked over to Harry and Hermione, dropping them off.        
        The wall. Everyone looks back and looks at the belly.        
        It shrinks while its music -- magic -- endures.           
        No one says a word.

- Draco. Look closely, son.

If we are the hand

Potter to the Dark Lord… everything was forgivable.

Everybody’s going to be like they were, you understand?

Now, we won’t forget who captured him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.

You dare talk to me like that in person?

Lucy.

Don’t be ashamed, my love.

come.

Now, if this is not what we have in mind,

Drake, and we call him, he’s going to kill us all.

We need to believe.

What’s with his face?

Yeah, what’s with his face?

That’s how it came to us.

He picked up something in the woods, I think.

Or he ran into a burner.

Were you the one who loved me?

He gave me his bread. We’ll see what his ultimate goal was.

Ah. I've got you.

What is that?

Where did you get that?

He was in his bag when we searched for him. Guess it’s mine now.

Are you crazy?

go! Get out!

Sissy, lead the men into the room.

I want to have a conversation with this, girl and boy.

What are we going to do? We can't leave Hermione alone.

Ronnie?

Harry?

Luna?

This sword must be kept in my will in Gringotts. How did you find it?

What else did you and your friends take from my trip?!

I didn’t take anything. please.

I didn’t take anything.

I don’t believe that.

We need to do something.

There is no direction here.

We tried everything. It’s magical.

- please! please!

- close!

You're bleeding, Harry.

That’s a good thing to keep in your socks.

Help us.

- Let him go.

- close. Come back.

You, Goblin, come with me.

- Ah!

- Dobby?

What are you doing here?

Dobby came to the rescue.

Harry Potter, of course.

Debbie is always there for Harry Potter.

Can you Apparate and get out of this room? Can you take us with you?

Of course not. I'm Alex.

It works for me.

Debbie, please take Lina and Mr. Ollivander--

Shel Cotts outside Tinworth.

Believe me.

Anytime you’re ready, man.

Sir? I like it very much.

Look at me at the top of the stairs for 10 seconds.

Yes.

Who will get their sword?

I’m going to ask just once, Goblin.

Think very, very carefully before you answer.

I don’t know.

Don't you know?

Why weren’t you doing your job?

Who got into my glass?

Who stole it?

Who stole it? good?

When I was on your last trip, there was gunfire.

Okay, so maybe he came out of himself then.

There is no place safer than Gringotts.

Liar!

Consider yourself lucky.

The same can’t be said for this one.

like ****.

Get rid of me?

Steph.

stop!

Drop your sticks.

I say leave them alone!

Take them, Draco, now.

All right, all right, look what we have here.

It’s Harry Potter.

It shines and sparkles and speaks anew in time to the Dark Lord.

Call it up.

Call it up.

In the past!

Stupid body.

- You could have killed me.

- Debbie was never killed.

Debbie was only causing injury or serious injury.

How can you take credit?

How do you oppose your gods?

Deb doesn’t have a king.

Dobby is a liberal Muslim.

And Dobby came to the rescue

Harry Potter and Friends.

Hermione.

You’re all good. We are safe.

We are safe.

Harry Potter.

Debbie.

Debbie. No, just -- hold on.

hold on. Look, be patient, okay?

We’ll fix you.

Hermione would find something.

In your bag. Hermione?

Hermione?

What is that? Help me.

Such a beautiful place… being with friends.

Dobby is happy with his friend… Harry Potter.

We need to close his eyes.

Don't you think so?

Now he could sleep.

I want to bury it.

The cut should be black.

It was our girlfriend’s day.

People think they get rid of evil.
But they are wrong.
I need to talk to the goblin.

The first time you came to Gringotts?
Even among goblins, your name is famous.

Yes.

How did you come upon this brand?
It's difficult.
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think
Should it be in his locker at Gringotts?
It's difficult.

We didn’t steal it.

Only a goblin can tell.
Because this is Griffith’s real gun.

A Hogwarts professor.
As I understand it, he’s the current principal of the school.
Snap?
Did he put a heavy sword in Bellatrix’s van?

And in Madame Lestrange’s closet, too?

This is impossible.
Dude, yes. But with you, no.

Why should I help you?
I have gold. A lot of it.

Harry: So what?

That's my price.
Hermione: Are you thinking
Horcruxes in Bellatrix's vows?
Harry: He was scared when he
He thought we were there.
He was going to keep asking you.
What else would we take.
I'm telling you there's a Horcruxes.
And another one.
Let us try to kill him.
We are one step closer to killing him.
Ron:
And what happens when we succeed?
How should we destroy it
Now you gave Griffik a gun?
Harry:
I’m still working on that part.
It's not weak.
Yes?
Mr. Ollivander, I have to ask you.
Some questions.
Ollivander:
Anything, anything, my son.

Are you curious about this bread?

Well, maybe you’ve got it from him.
I felt that his love had changed.

The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
That much is always obvious
For those of us who have read Wanda.
And what do you know
About death?
Supposedly, there are three:
The old wand...
…invisibility cloak
To hide you from your enemies…
…and the Sunset Stone .
to raise people from the dead.
They are together and make one.
Lord of Death.
But few people believe.
That those things exist.
Harry:
do you?
Are you sure they exist, man?
I have no reason to give up.
In an old wives' tale.
You are lying.
You know there’s something.
You told him about it.
You told him about the boss.
And he could go as far as he wanted.
It hurt me.

There ...
There’s no telling if he’ll get it.
He got it right.
We will make you comfortable.
Ollivander:

Hermonie:

Ron:
Hey. easy.
He gives it to us, we can too.
Use that knife to cut our own canons.

No, of course not. I was being a fool.
Harry:

Let's do it.

I don't think that would be necessary.
Madame Lestrange.
I don’t like having to wait.

They know it.
They know he’s a cheater.
They have been warned.
Harry?
What are we going to do, Harry?
Madame Lestrange,
Do you want to show off your bar?
And why should I?
That’s the Bank’s policy. I believe in you.
Understand in terms of the current climate.
No, I don’t understand.
I'm afraid I need to insist.

We had an agreement in Griffik.

Little regards, Git.
At least we still got Bogrod.

You are the smart one.
I get something, but it’s weak.

He knows. Who-are-you.
He knows we broke into Gringotts.
Do you know what we picked?
And he knows we’re looking for Horcruxes.
- How do you know?
- I saw that.
Hermonie:
Let him in? Harry, you can't do that.
Hermione, I can't help it anymore.
Well, I can be. I don’t know.
Ron:
never mind. what happened?
Well, he was angry.
And fear too.
He knows when we gain all and lose all
We can kill it.
I don't think he'll stop at anything.
To make sure we don’t get the others.
There are many. One of them is at Hogwarts.
Hermonie:
what?
- Did you see that?
- I saw the castle and Rowena Ravenclaw.
It needs to be addressed.
We need to get there now.
We can’t do that. We need to make a plan.
We have to notice it.
Hermione, when do we have a plan?
Have you worked?
We'll be ready, we'll get there.
All hell breaks loose.
Of course.
One problem: Snap is now the principal.
We can’t just walk through the front door.
Um, well, we’re going to Hogsmeade,
to Honeyduck.
Take the secret path in the room.
It's-- there's something about it.
It’s like, you know, in the past I’ve been

If so, it’s too risky.

Any signs?

4 men:

The old man:
Here, Potter.
Have you tried it?
- For a second I thought it was ...
Hermione: I know. Dumbledore.
[Men talking off to the side]
Harry?
I can see you on this one.
[Door closes]
You foolish people!
What were you thinking coming here?
Do you have any idea how dangerous it is?
You are Aberforth, brother of Dumbledore.
You are what I saw here.
You’re the one who sent Debbie.
Where did you put him?
He's dead.
Please hear it. I love that dress.
Who gave that to you? A mirror?
Mundungus Fletcher, one year ago.
- There's no room for change. It was --
Aberford: Sure.
Albert told me.
He also told me that he might get fired.
If you knew I had it.
…but ask yourself
If you weren’t, where would you be?
Are you hearing a lot?
From ordering?
The matter is over.
You know who won.
Anyone who says otherwise .
They are playing with themselves.
We were to enter Hogwarts tonight.
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
Did he just now?
Good job? easy?
We were looking for Horcruxes.
We think the end is in the castle.
But we need help getting in.
That’s not a job my brother gave you.
It’s a suicide mission.
Do yourself a favor, man, go home.
Just wait a little longer.
"Dumbledore is sure I'll see that."
- What makes you think you can trust him?
You think you can believe
Did my brother tell you something?
You know when.
Did he say my name?
Did he say his?
- Why should he--?
- Keep secrets? You told me.
- I believe him.
- That's the man's answer.
The boy who goes after Horks
According to one man...
…who wouldn’t tell him where to start.
You're lying!
It’s not just me, it’s not important.
To yourself, too.
That’s what the genius did.
You’re not striking me for a fool.
Harry Potter.
So I ask you again.
There had to be a reason.
I don't like what happened.
Between you and your brother.
I don’t care that you gave up on me.
I believe in the man, I know.
And we need to enter
at the castle tonight.
You know what to do.
Harry:
Where did you send it?
You'll see soon.
That's your sister, Aria, isn't she?
He died young, didn’t he?
My brother sacrificed a lot,
Mr. Potter...
...just in time to get stronger...
…including Ariana.
And he was devoted to her.
He gave her everything…
…but time.
Hermonie:
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

He saved our lives twice.
Follow us in the mirror.

Just like the person who left him.
He's coming back.

This is nothing. Simmons is worse.
Hey AB, we got a few more!

Ron: Don't worry about this.

This is because it has never happened until now.

Hermonie:
How is Snap being mean to the principal?
It's never hard for him.
You just have to pay attention to the cracks.
Carrots?
Yes. brother and sister.
He controls discipline.
They like to punish, months.
Hermonie:
They did that to you? why?
Neville: Today's Dark Arts Lesson
We used to curse the Cruciatus.
In the early years.
I accepted it.
Hogwarts has changed.
Let’s have a little fun, shall we?
Hey, listen, lots of you.
It gave you a surprise.
I look forward to seeing more of Aberford’s cooking.
You’re a miracle if we can digest it.
Blimey.

- Yes!
Spread the word to Remus and everyone else
Harry is back.
Better not kill it before.
Who-are--
Dad, the DA is calling. Are you reading?
We have a new weather report:
The light struck.
What's the solution, Harry?
Harry:
ok.
We need to find something.
Something is hidden in the castle.
And it can help us defeat you-know-who.
right. What is that?
We don't know.
Neo: Where is it?
Harry: We don't know either.
- I understand that there is not much to go on.
- It's nothing to go on.
I think he has something to do.
With Ravenclaw.
And it's small, it folds down easily.
Anyone, any thoughts?
Well, there’s Raven Ravenclaw
Lost electricity.
- Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.
Luna: Ravenclaw's Lost Electron?
Has anyone ever heard of that?
It’s very well known.
Yes, but Luna, she has disappeared.
For centuries.
No one is alive today.
Who saw it.
excuse me. Can someone tell me
What is diaphragm?
It’s a bit of a cross.
You know, like Terry.

Harry.
Hi.
He didn’t see me for six months.
And it’s like I was Frank the first year.
- I'm his brother.
- I've got a lot of those.
- There's only one Harry.
- Shut up, Samus.
What is that, Jenny?
Snape knew. He knows that Harry
He was seen at Hogsmeade.
[Group Walk]
Many of you are wondering .
Why did I call you at this time.
It occurred to me.
Earlier that night…
...Harry Potter appears
In Hogsmeade.

...anyone who...
…students or employees
Try to help Mr. Potter...
...they will be forced...
...in a manner consistent with
Their destruction is terrible.
furthermore...
…anyone who’s rich has experience
In the news...
...who failed to come forward...
...will be treated as...
...Guilty one.
Now then…
...If there's someone here...
... Mr. Potter has a culture.
Movements tonight…
…I call on them to step forward…
...now.

It seems that, despite all your efforts
Defense Measures...
…you still have a security issue

And I’m afraid it’s too big.

Tell them how you looked into his eyes.

Some of you might think
The struggle is wisdom.
But this is crazy.

Do this and no one gets hurt.
Give me Harry Potter.
And I leave Hogwarts untouched.
Give me Harry Potter…

Someone grabbed him.

They have to get out of bed.

I assume you have a reason to come back.
Potter. What do you need?
Time, teacher.
As fast as you can find me.
Do what you gotta do.
I protect the castle.
Potter.
Good to see you.
It’s great that you’re also a teacher.
Hold the castle, Neville.
[Students talking]

Hurry up and come!
Ronnie: Harry. Me and Hermonie.
They think.
If we got Hork, it wouldn't matter.
- what do you mean?
— until we destroyed it.
Ron:
So we were thinking …
Ron was thinking.
That was Ron's idea. It's nice.
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary.
With basil teeth, right?
Hermione and I.
Know where we can find one.
ok.
Well, but for this one. That way you can
You’ll find me when you get back.
- Where are you going?
- Ravenclaw Common Room.
I have to start somewhere.
Luna:
Harry. Harry!
Let me get this straight.
You give us permission to do this?
That's true, Longott.
Blow it up? Boom?
Boom!

Are we going to do that?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Finnigan?
As I recall, he had a very specific idea
For pyrotechnics.
I can get off on it.
It is the mind. Now you’re going.
Understand the truth, we can't leave us.
Always you-know-who.
McGonagall: Yeah, that doesn't make sense.
We cannot allow it.
His name is Voldemort, Fleus.
You can use it too.
He’s going to try to kill you anyway.

- I'm worried about this right now, Luna.
You won't get anything.
Where you’re going. You are wasting time.
- Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?
- Harry.
- behind.
- Harry Potter!
Listen to me now!
Don't you remember what Cho said?
On Rowena Ravenolov’s wardrobe?
"There's no one alive."
Who saw it."
Obvious, right?
We need to talk to someone who’s dead.
Pretty impressive, isn’t it?
If you want to get it
You’ll find it below.
Harry: Aren't you coming?
Luna: Nope.
I think it’s better if you two talk alone.
She is very shy.
Harry:
You’re a gray woman…
…the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.
I don’t respond to that name.
No, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
It’s Helena, right? Helena Ravenclaw.
Daughter of Rowena.
Are you friends with Luni?

Yes.
And he thinks you can

He lied to a lot of people.
I know what he did! I know who he is!
He tainted her with dark magic!

But if you tell me where he hid it.
You know where he put it.
Don’t you Helena?
You’ll just have to tell me.

Harry:
In the past!
Enter your birthday!
Jenny. Neville. Are you all right?
It’s never okay. Looks like I could be in the fire forest.
You haven’t seen Luna, have you?
- Luna?

I thought it was time I told her.
Because we’re both going to die forever.
I know.

That's it. I-- I did.
Let's go.

Draco:

[Voices whispering]
[Unpopular applause]
Draco:
It’s good, it’s good.
What brings you here, Potter?
I can ask you the same.
You have something of mine.
I want to go back.
- What do you have?
Draco: My mother's.
It’s powerful, but it’s not the same.
He doesn't understand me very well.
You know what I mean?
Why didn’t you tell him?
Bellatrix.
You knew it was me.
You didn’t say anything.
Come on, Draco.
Don’t be a brat. You did it.
Draco:
easy.

Come on, Najin. I need to protect you.
[Pant]
Harry:
It's a snake.
He is the ultimate. That’s the end of Horkia.
Ron:
Look inside, Harry.
Find out where it is.
If we have, we can get a snake.
So we can end this.
Lucy:
"My Lord?"
Maybe less, uh ...
Isn’t it common sense
To stop this attack...
…and just ask for the boy yourself?
Voldemort:
I don’t need to look for the child.
Before nightfall he comes to me.
Do you understand?
Look at me.
How can you live with yourself, Lucy?
I don’t know.
Go find Severus.
Bring him to me.
I know where it is.
Oliver:

Cruciae!
Hermonie:

SNAPE: You did a good job.
With that magic wand, my Lord…
…Just in the last few hours.
Voldemort:
No.
No, I’m a weird person…
…but the bull hates me.
Snap:
There is no butter that is more powerful.
Oliver himself said so.
To-night the man came;
You will never fail. I believe that.
He gives you the answer…
…and only you.
Does it happen?
"My Lord?"
Wand, does it answer me?
You’re a smart guy, Severus.
Of course you should know.
Where is his true love?
Snap;
If you want…
… Of course, my lord.
Voldemort:
The old wand...
...couldn't work for me properly.
Because I am not his true master.
The old wand belongs to the wizard.

You killed Dumbledore, Severus.
While you are in life.
The old wand cannot be mine.
You are very professional and loving.
Severus…

Give me something. brief.
Anything floral.
Snap:
Take them pansy.
Look at me.
You have your mother’s eyes.
[regret]
Voldemort:
Fight the weakness…
...but nothing.
I don't want this.
Every drop of magic blood drained.
This is a terrible loss.
I ordered my troops to retreat.
in their absence;
Dispose of your dead with dignity.
Harry Potter, I'm talking to you right now.
Tonight you let
Having your friends die for you…
…rather than directing yourself at me.
There is no greater shame.
Join me in the Forbidden Forest.
And challenge your fate.
If you don’t do this…
…I’ll kill every last man.
Woman and child...
…Who wants to insert you into me.
Hermonie:
Where is everyone?
Harry.
SPROUT: Oh, come on.
What's wrong with you?
Trellona:
Oh, it passed.
There he went.
[crying]
Petroni:
savage!
come here.
I’m going to tell Mom. You're an idiot.
You're insane, Lily!
come here.
Snap: Because he's jealous.
He’s an ordinary person and you’re a special one.
Lily:
That is, Severus.
[Lily laughs]
Hat choices:
Gryffindor!
[Students applaud]
- Hi. I'm James.
- Hi. I'm Lily.
Snap:
Just like your father. lazy. arrogant.
Harry:
Don’t say anything to my father.
Trellona:
The blood flows…
…and a merchant and a master
They will be reassembled.
Voldemort:
Severus.
Snap:
No, don’t kill him.
Dumbledore:
The prophet did not speak of a woman.
She talked about a baby who was born at the end of July.
Yes, but she thought it was her son.
He wants to find them now.
To kill them.
Hide it. Hide them all. I’m calling you.
Dumbledore: What will you give me?
Instead, Severus?
anything.
Lily:
Harry. Harry, I love you so much. Love it.
Harry, Mom loves you.
Dada loves you.
Harry, you're safe.
Empower them.
Voldemort:
Avada Kadavra!

Snap:
You said you’d protect him.
Dumbledore: Lily and James have
Their trust in the wrong person, Severus.
But like you.
The man lives.
He doesn’t need protection.
The Dark Lord is born.
The Dark Lord will be back.
And if he does .
The boy will be in serious danger.
He has his eyes.
If you really loved him ...
No one can know.
Dumbledore: Which I must never reveal.
Your best, Severus?
Snap:
Your word.
Dumbledore: If you risk your life.
Every day to protect the boy?
Snape: He has no measurable talent;
His pride clashes with his father’s…
…and he seems to be enjoying his reputation.
Harry:
Don’t say anything to my father.
Snap:
James Potter?
Lazy, arrogant.
Harry:
My father is a great man.
Your father was a pig!
Snap:
Drink the rest.
There will be a curse in it from your hand.

It spreads, Albus.
Dumbledore:
How long?
Snap:
Maybe one year.
Don’t mind me, Severus.
Draco:
Harmonia Necter Pasus.
We both know Lord Voldemort.
He orders the young Malfoy to ***.
But if he fails.
One must think the Dark Lord is...
…suits you.
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.
That’s the only way.
Therefore the Lord of Darkness
I believe in you.
Snap:
Avad Kadafra.
Dumbledore: There will come a time.
When needed to tell Harry Potter something.
But you have to wait until Voldemort
This is part of its greatest weakness.
What needs to be said?
Dumbledore:
Night Lord Voldemort...
...went to Godric's Hollow and killed Harry...
…and Lily Potter made her own
Among them…
...The curse lifted.
When this happened .
Part of Voldemort's soul...
… He held himself to the only living thing.
Available at:
Harry himself
There are a few reasons Harry might talk
with snakes.
There’s a reason you might try
The mind of Lord Voldemort.
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.
So, when the time comes…
...The guy should die?
Yes. Yes.
He must die.
You kept her alive.
So that he could die at the right time.
You raised him.
Like a pig to the slaughter.
Now don’t tell me you’re grown.
Take care of the boy?
Snap:
Wait for the patronom.
Lily.
After all this time?
always.
So, when the time comes…
...The guy should die?
Yes. He must die.
And Voldemort himself has to do it.
That’s important.
Hermonie:
Where were you?
- We thought you went wild.
- I'll go there now.
Ron:
Are you crazy? No.
You can’t give yourself to him.
Hermonie:
What is it, Harry?
What do you know?
There’s a reason I can listen to them…
...the Horks.
I think I’ve known for a while.
And I think you are too.
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.
Kill the snake then it is.
I was ready to die.
The Stone of Knowledge.
Be kind, my love.
Why are you here?
All of you?
We never left.
Does it--?
Does it hurt?

It’s faster than sleep.
You’ll get there, baby.
Harry:
I'm sorry.
I don’t want any of you to die for me.
And Remus, your son ...
Other people tell him .
What his mother and father died for.
One day, you’ll understand.
Will you stay with me?
until the very end.
And he can’t see you?
Sirius:
No.
We’re here, you see.
Stay close to me.

Death Eater:
There is no sign, my lord.
Voldemort:
I thought it would.
Harry? No! What are you doing here?
quiet!
Harry Potter.
The man who was.
And die.
Avada Kadavra!
[Man gasps for breath]
Dumbledore:
You can't help it. Harry...
...you good boy.
You are a good man.
Let's walk.
Teacher, what is that?
Something more than both of our helpings.
A part of Voldemort was sent here to die.
And where exactly are we?
I was going to ask you that.
Where are we, you mean?
good...
...It looks like King's Crust Cake.
Just a cleanser.
And not all trains.
The King’s Cross, is it real?
This is like your team.
I hope you understand by now.
You and Voldemort…
…you were wrong about something.
This is not a heart...
...since that night in Godric's vault.
For all those years.
So is that true, man?
Part of it lives inside me, doesn’t it?

It has been broken for a long time.
None other than Voldemort himself.
You were Horcruxes.
It had never happened, Harry.
Should I come back?
Oh. That’s up to you.
Do I have a choice?
Oh yeah.
We’re at King’s Cross, you say?
I think if you want
You could get on the train.
And where does it lead me?
[Dumbledore Shackles]

[Thorn whistle howls in the distance]
Voldemort has the old wand.
TRUE.
- And the snake is still alive.
- Yes.
And I have nothing to kill him.
There is always help at Hogwarts.
Harry, for those who are looking for it.
I’ve always found myself useful.
About my ability to change a sentence.
The words are,
My opinion hasn't changed...
...Our favorite is chicken.
The Source of Magic...
…which can cause both injuries
and cure it.
But I want, in this case,
Edited my original comment to this:
Help is always available at Hogwarts
People with it.
Don’t feel sorry for the dead, Harry.
The living are merciful.
And, above all,
All who live without love.
Teacher, my mother's boss.
Was it a dog?
It's the same as Professor Snape's.
Wondering, you think?
Seriously, when I think about it.
It doesn’t seem to be a challenge at all.
I'm leaving now, Harry.
Teacher?
Is all of this true?
Gr Is that just happening in my head?
Of course, that would be inside
Your head Harry.
Why should that not be true?
Teacher? What should I do?
Teacher?

Neville Longbottom.
[Followers of Voldemort

Well, Neville, I’m sure we can.
Get a spot on our teams.
I want to say something.
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'll all be impressed.
To hear your voice.
- It's nothing Harry left.
- Stop, Neville.
People are dying every day.
Family of friends.
Yes.
We left Harry's tonight.
But he’s here with us.
Also Fred…
...and Remus.
A tank.
All of them.
They didn’t die in vain.
But you do it.

Harry's heart leaps for us.
All of us. This isn’t over!

You were right…

You had failed that wand.
You will always fail.

I managed to find it.
And I lost some …
Hagrid:
Harry.

Hermione: Why didn't it work for him?
An old wand?
She answered to someone else.
When he killed Snape
He thought the burro would be his.
But the thing is,
The stick wasn’t Snap’s.
It was Draco who removed Dumbledore's gun.
That night in the sky tower.
From that time on,

Albus Severus Potter...

Hogwarts K.
One of them was E Slytherin…

I never knew.
But just say I am.
Then Slytherin House comes to power.
A remarkable young wizard.
But, listen, it makes a lot of sense.
For you, you get to choose Gryffindor.
Choosing a hat.
It’s considering your choice.
