1
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,310
Lumos Maxima.

2
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,360
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,090
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,260
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,140
Lumos Maxima!

6
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,130
Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,300
Harry, open the door.

8
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,510
Marge. How lovely to see...

9
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,100
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

10
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,600
What is it?

11
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,900
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,730
Later perhaps, if you behave.

13
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,110
I will if she does.

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,410
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

15
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,450
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

16
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,580
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

17
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,080
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. Vernon.

18
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,630
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,590
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,050
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

21
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,180
Okay.

22
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,430
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

23
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,400
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

24
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,560
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

25
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,150
A bit more.

26
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,990
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,780
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

28
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,870
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,080
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,380
What are you smirking at?

31
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,380
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

32
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,880
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,050
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

34
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,850
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,730
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

36
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,480
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

37
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,820
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

38
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,110
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,200
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

40
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,540
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

41
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,710
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

42
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,710
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

43
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,420
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

44
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,510
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,510
I think it's time you went to bed.

46
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,930
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

47
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,310
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

48
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,270
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

49
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,490
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

50
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,360
Shut up! Shut up!

51
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,120
Right.

52
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,410
Let me tell you...

53
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,980
Vernon!

54
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,820
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

55
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Stop!

56
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,410
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

57
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,830
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

58
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,920
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

59
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,960
Oh, Vernon.

60
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,880
Oh, God.

61
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,840
Marge!

62
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,100
Please!

63
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,940
Marge!

64
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,190
Come back!

65
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,590
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

66
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,010
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

67
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,600
- Keep away from me.
- You not allowed to do magic outside school.

68
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,810
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

69
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,310
You've nowhere to go.

70
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,820
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

71
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,790
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

72
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,330
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

73
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,460
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

74
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,640
What you doing down there?

75
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,550
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?

76
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,430
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

77
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,810
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

78
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,990
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

79
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,910
Well, come on, then. In.

80
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,910
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.

81
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,080
Come on.

82
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,720
Come on. Move on, move on, move on!

83
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,740
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

84
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,160
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

85
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,130
- What did you say your name was again?
- I didn't.

86
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,800
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

87
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,930
You hear that Ern? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

88
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,430
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

89
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,390
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

90
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,440
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

91
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,360
They don't see nothing, do they?

92
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,070
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

93
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,870
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

94
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,170
Ten, nine, eight...

95
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,090
...seven, six, five...

96
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,550
...four, three, three and a half...

97
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,550
...two, one and three quarters.

98
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,720
Yes!

99
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,430
Who is that?

100
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,020
That man.

101
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,480
Who is that?

102
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,190
Who is...?

103
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,780
That is Sirius Black, that is.

104
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,620
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

105
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,200
He's a murderer.

106
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,000
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

107
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,080
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

108
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,210
He's the first one that done it.

109
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,800
He was a big supporter of...

110
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,800
...You-Know-Who.

111
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,390
I reckon you've heard of him.

112
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,140
Yeah.

113
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,640
Him I've heard of.

114
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,980
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

115
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,150
They're getting closer, Ernie.

116
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,190
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

117
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,990
Mind your head.

118
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,830
Hey, guys? Guys?

119
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,210
Why the long faces?

120
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,470
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

121
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,310
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

122
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,320
Mr. Potter, at last.

123
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,030
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

124
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,050
Room 11.

125
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,980
Hedwig.

126
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,980
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

127
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,860
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

128
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,400
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

129
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,780
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

130
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,910
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

131
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,830
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

132
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,800
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

133
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,680
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

134
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,430
So that's that...

135
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,470
...and no harm done.

136
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,470
Pea soup?

137
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,770
No, thank you.

138
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,150
- Minister?
- Yes?

139
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,060
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

140
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,820
I broke the law. Underage wizards
aren't allowed to use magic at home.

141
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,030
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

142
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,740
...for blowing up their aunts.

143
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,250
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

144
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,880
...was very, very irresponsible.

145
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,880
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

146
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,880
Sirius Black, you mean?

147
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,800
But what's he got to do with me?

148
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,930
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

149
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,270
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

150
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,400
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

151
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,570
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

152
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,700
Hedwig.

153
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,960
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

154
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,710
...wander.

155
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,170
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

156
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,000
Housekeeping.

157
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,670
I'll come back later.

158
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,680
I'm warning you, Hermione.

159
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,560
Keep that bloody beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

160
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,810
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

161
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,980
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

162
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,700
- Looks like a pig with hair, lf u ask me.
- That's rich...

163
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,410
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

164
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,990
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

165
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,790
Harry.

166
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,290
Harry.

167
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,540
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

168
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,090
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

169
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,470
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

170
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,800
- Not flashing that clipping again, Are you Ron?
- I haven't shown anyone.

171
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,390
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

172
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,970
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

173
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,270
- The cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

174
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,850
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

175
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,190
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

176
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,690
- Got everything you need?
- Yes.

177
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,030
- Yes? All your books?
- Yea, It's all upstairs.

178
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,610
- Your clothes?
- Everything there.

179
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,200
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

180
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,240
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

181
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,910
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

182
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,750
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

183
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,540
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

184
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,460
Harry, there are some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

185
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,300
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

186
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,800
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

187
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,520
You are in danger.

188
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,690
Grave danger.

189
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,810
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

190
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,030
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

191
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,900
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

192
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,410
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

193
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,410
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

194
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,910
Sorry.

195
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,000
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

196
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,790
...Black lost everything.

197
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,250
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

198
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,590
And in his mind...

199
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

200
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,680
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

201
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,020
And that is why...

202
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,730
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

203
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,770
To find you.

204
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,860
And kill me.

205
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,490
Harry, would you swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

206
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,200
...you won't go looking for Black.

207
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,910
Mr. Weasley...

208
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,080
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

209
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,500
Quick. Quick.

210
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,620
Ron, Ron!

211
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,420
Oh, for goodness' sake!

212
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,090
Don't lose him!

213
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,220
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

214
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,840
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

215
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,600
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

216
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,520
I was lucky not to be arrested.

217
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,730
I still think it was brilliant.

218
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,650
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

219
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,860
Who do you think that is?

220
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,900
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

221
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,200
How is it she knows everything?

222
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,490
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

223
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,080
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

224
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,920
I gotta tell you something.

225
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,470
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

226
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
...to come after you?
- Yeah.

227
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

228
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,520
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

229
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,030
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

230
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,200
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

231
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,280
Why are we stopping?

232
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,080
We can't be there yet.

233
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,540
What's going on?

234
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,420
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

235
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,670
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

236
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,470
There's something moving out there.

237
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,110
I think someone's coming aboard.

238
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,180
Bloody hell! What's happening?

239
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,880
Harry.

240
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,800
Harry, are you all right?

241
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,640
Thank you.

242
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,270
Here, eat this. It'll help.

243
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,900
It's all right. It's chocolate.

244
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,280
What was that thing that came?

245
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,870
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

246
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,740
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

247
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,540
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

248
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,050
Eat. You'll feel better.

249
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,180
What happened to me?

250
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,100
Well, you sort of went rigid.

251
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,430
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

252
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,980
And did either of you two...

253
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,480
...you know...

254
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,730
...pass out?
- No.

255
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,610
I felt weird, though.

256
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,610
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

257
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,080
But someone was screaming.

258
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,620
A woman.

259
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,580
No one was screaming, Harry.

260
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,520
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

261
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,770
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

262
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,270
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

263
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,690
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

264
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,320
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

265
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,990
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

266
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,700
Good luck, professor.

267
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,630
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

268
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,460
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

269
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,300
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

270
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,470
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

271
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,010
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher for many years...

272
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,100
...has decided to retire...

273
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,020
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

274
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,940
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

275
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,940
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

276
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,450
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

277
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,500
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

278
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,210
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

279
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:04,590
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

280
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,720
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

281
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,350
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

282
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,190
Now whilst I've been assured...

283
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,030
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

284
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,530
...a word of caution.

285
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,900
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

286
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,490
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

287
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,290
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

288
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,080
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

289
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,960
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

290
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,390
But you know,
happiness can be found...

291
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,180
...even in the darkest of times...

292
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,270
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

293
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Fortuna Major.

294
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,790
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

295
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,920
- Fortuna Major.
- No, No, No! Wait, wait.

296
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,920
Watch this.

297
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,640
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.

298
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,400
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

299
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Still doing that after three years.

300
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,740
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

301
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,120
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

302
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,530
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

303
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,660
Green. That's a monkey.

304
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,130
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

305
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,500
Do not give him one again.

306
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,300
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

307
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,140
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

308
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,440
I think we have a winner.

309
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,730
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

310
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,860
Look at him. His face.

311
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,740
Welcome, my children.

312
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:18,040
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

313
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,500
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

314
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,880
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

315
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:33,680
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

316
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,720
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
which is the art of reading tea leaves.

317
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,480
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

318
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,350
What do you see?

319
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,190
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

320
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,820
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

321
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,530
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

322
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,620
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

323
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,460
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

324
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,920
Is your grandmother quite well?

325
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,040
I think so.

326
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:09,010
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

327
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,380
Pity.

328
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,220
Broaden your minds.

329
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:23,140
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

330
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,230
- I think you are.
- Sure.

331
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,650
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

332
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,530
Yeah.

333
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,780
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

334
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,870
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

335
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,410
So...

336
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,620
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

337
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,170
Give me the cup.

338
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,630
Oh, my dear boy.

339
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,380
My dear...

340
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,140
...you have the Grim.

341
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,720
The Grin? What's the Grin?

342
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,770
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

343
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,100
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

344
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,770
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

345
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,980
It's an omen...

346
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,990
...of death."

347
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:22,330
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black, do you?

348
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,420
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

349
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,290
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

350
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,590
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

351
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,420
A fair few.

352
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,680
Hang on. That's not possible.

353
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,640
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

354
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,810
You have to be in two
classes at once.

355
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,350
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

356
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,770
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

357
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,860
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

358
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,910
I got a real treat for you today.

359
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,070
A great lesson. So follow me.

360
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,420
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

361
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,090
And open your books to page 49.

362
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,880
Exactly how do we do that?

363
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,970
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

364
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,150
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

365
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,030
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

366
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,700
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

367
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,580
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

368
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,880
Shut up, Malfoy.

369
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,430
Dementor! Dementor!

370
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,530
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

371
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,160
Yeah.

372
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,380
Isn't he beautiful?

373
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,170
Say hello to Buckbeak.

374
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,010
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

375
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,260
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

376
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,930
First thing you wanna know about hippogriff
is they're very proud creatures.

377
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,020
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

378
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,940
It may just be the last thing you ever do.

379
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,480
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

380
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,110
Well done, Harry. Well done.

381
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,280
Come on now.

382
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,160
Now...

383
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,080
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

384
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,120
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

385
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,750
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

386
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,050
If he does, you can go and touch him.

387
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:21,420
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

388
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,140
Just make your bow.

389
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,390
Nice and low.

390
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,400
Back off, Harry. Back off.

391
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,780
Keep still.

392
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,450
Keep still.

393
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,040
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

394
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,090
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

395
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,130
Go on. Don't be shy.

396
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,020
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

397
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,770
Not so fast, Harry.

398
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,110
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

399
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,490
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

400
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,710
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

401
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,710
That's it...

402
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,670
Yes!

403
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,670
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

404
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Does he get to fly?

405
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,430
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

406
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,180
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

407
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,520
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

408
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,560
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

409
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,000
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

410
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,130
That was wicked, Harry!

411
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,710
Oh, please.

412
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,840
Well done, well done.

413
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,720
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

414
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,350
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

415
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,940
Malfoy, no...

416
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,310
No!

417
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,650
Buckbeak!

418
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,990
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

419
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,950
Whoa! Buckbeak!

420
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,410
Away, you silly creature...

421
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,700
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

422
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,120
Hagrid!

423
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:25,500
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

424
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,420
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

425
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,880
You and your bloody chicken!

426
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,410
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

427
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,460
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

428
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,960
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

429
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,170
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

430
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,680
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

431
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,600
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

432
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,640
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

433
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,560
Sirius Black!

434
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

435
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,650
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

436
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,320
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

437
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,820
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

438
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:40,580
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

439
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,540
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

440
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,730
Intriguing, isn't it?

441
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,740
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

442
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,700
...as to what is inside?

443
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,910
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

444
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,580
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

445
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,840
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

446
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,550
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

447
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,970
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

448
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,590
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

449
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,270
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

450
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,400
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

451
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,190
After me. Riddikulus!

452
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,530
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.

453
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,240
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

454
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,660
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!

455
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,950
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

456
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,160
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

457
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:12,080
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

458
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:16,710
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

459
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,010
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

460
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,550
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,220
Come on.

462
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,190
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

463
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,060
Professor Snape.

464
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,110
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

465
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,690
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

466
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,370
- I believe,You live with your grandmother.
- Yes but I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either.

467
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,450
No...

468
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,080
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

469
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,540
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

470
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,840
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

471
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,880
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

472
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,390
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

473
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,760
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

474
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,680
Can you do that?

475
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,980
Yes. Wand at the ready.

476
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,810
One, two, three.

477
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,490
Think, Neville, think.

478
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,290
Riddikulus!

479
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,500
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

480
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,630
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

481
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,180
Form a line!

482
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,770
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

483
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,060
...and turn it into something funny.

484
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,980
Next! Ron!

485
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,740
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

486
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,750
Wand at the ready, Ron.

487
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,340
Riddikulus!

488
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,840
Yes!

489
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:25,340
You see? Very good, very good!

490
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:31,680
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

491
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,690
Show us what you see.

492
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,370
Keep your nerve. Steady.

493
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,490
Riddikulus!

494
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,500
And next! Step up, step up!

495
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,420
Wonderful, wonderful!

496
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,560
Here!

497
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,230
Riddikulus!

498
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,660
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

499
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,830
Collect your books from the back of the class.

500
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,620
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

501
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,830
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

502
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,420
Now remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

503
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,550
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school on any way...

504
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,640
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

505
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,390
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

506
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,100
That's the rule, Potter.

507
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:01,520
All those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

508
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,190
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...

509
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,860
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

510
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,240
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

511
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:17,120
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

512
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,580
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

513
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,430
Professor, can I ask you something?

514
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,480
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

515
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,110
I thought it'd be obvious.

516
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,110
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

517
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,780
I did think of Voldemort at first.

518
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,620
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

519
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,330
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

520
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,370
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

521
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,040
This is very wise.

522
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,290
Before I fainted...

523
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,540
...I heard something.

524
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,710
A woman...

525
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,510
...screaming.

526
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,970
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

527
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,100
Our pain becomes their power.

528
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,140
I think it was my mother...

529
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,520
...the night she was murdered.

530
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,610
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

531
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,030
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

532
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,610
They're your mother, Lily's.

533
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:34,990
Yes.

534
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,330
Oh, yes. I knew her.

535
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,500
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

536
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:47,920
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

537
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:51,420
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

538
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,010
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

539
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:01,350
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

540
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:05,520
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

541
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,230
...he...

542
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:11,070
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

543
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,870
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

544
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:25,830
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

545
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:29,800
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

546
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,640
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

547
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,390
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

548
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,600
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.

549
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,480
What's going on?

550
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,110
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

551
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,690
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

552
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:57,160
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

553
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,450
Get back, all of you.

554
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,790
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

555
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,290
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

556
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,840
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

557
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,920
It's not funny, Ron.

558
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,010
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

559
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:25,390
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

560
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,560
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

561
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,650
You heard. Move!

562
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,750
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

563
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,170
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

564
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,460
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

565
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,430
The Fat Lady's there.

566
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,260
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

567
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,510
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

568
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,100
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

569
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,570
Dear lady, who did this to you?

570
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,530
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

571
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:23,450
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

572
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,080
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

573
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,500
Sirius Black!

574
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:33,840
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

575
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:06,830
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

576
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,540
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

577
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,710
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.

578
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,540
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

579
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,250
I didn't really expect him to linger.

580
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:20,840
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

581
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,300
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

582
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:26,140
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

583
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,180
Any theories on how he managed it?

584
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,350
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

585
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,150
You may recall...

586
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:36,150
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

587
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,400
...about your appointment
of Professor...

588
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,660
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

589
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,240
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...

590
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,040
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

591
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,540
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

592
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,380
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

593
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,960
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

594
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:06,760
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

595
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,430
Turn to page 394.

596
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:00,440
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

597
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:04,570
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

598
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,620
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

599
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:13,870
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

600
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,380
"Werewolves"?

601
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,460
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

602
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,840
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

603
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:30,220
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

604
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:34,350
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

605
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,980
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

606
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,610
No one?

607
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:43,030
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

608
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,400
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

609
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,110
A werewolf has no choice.

610
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,240
With each full moon...

611
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:54,290
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

612
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,080
Further more, the werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

613
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,000
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

614
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:04,510
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

615
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,670
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

616
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,180
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

617
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,890
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

618
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,690
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

619
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:22,610
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

620
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,320
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

621
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,780
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

622
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:34,040
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

623
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,000
Page 394.

624
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,460
The term "werewolf"...

625
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:46,880
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

626
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:52,050
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

627
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,060
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

628
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,270
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

629
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,440
...being bitten by a werewolf...

630
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,880
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

631
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,500
Aresto momentum!

632
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,880
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

633
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,340
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet here.

634
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,380
Come on Ron, let's walk you off the Astronomy Tower
and see what you look like.

635
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,640
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

636
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:46,270
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

637
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,440
You gave us a right good scare there mate.

638
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:52,190
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

639
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,820
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

640
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,950
No one blames you, Harry.

641
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,000
Dementors aren't supposed to come inside
the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

642
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,290
After he saved you,
he sent them straight off.

643
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:11,130
There's something else
you should know too, Harry.

644
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:18,010
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

645
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,010
Well...

646
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,560
I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

647
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:26,520
Is there no chance of fixing it?

648
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,060
No.

649
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:31,560
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

650
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,070
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

651
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:38,400
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

652
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:42,870
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

653
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:48,000
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

654
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:52,420
You are not weak, Harry.

655
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:56,670
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

656
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,970
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

657
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,720
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

658
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:06,970
- I'm scared, professor.
- Well!, I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

659
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,650
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

660
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:12,810
You made the one
on the train go away.

661
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,770
There was only one that night.

662
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:19,650
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

663
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:24,950
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an particular interest in you...

664
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,790
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

665
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,870
For now, I need to rest.

666
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,610
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

667
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:18,210
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

668
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,300
- But not clever enough.
- Beside, We've got a better way.

669
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:24,300
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

670
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:25,680
We'll get you there.

671
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,560
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.

672
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,310
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

673
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,520
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

674
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,070
What are you doing?!

675
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,150
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

676
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,660
- That map, it's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me...

677
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,740
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

678
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,660
George, if you will.

679
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:54,120
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

680
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:01,340
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...

681
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,720
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

682
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,220
We owe them so much.

683
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:14,600
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

684
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:17,230
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

685
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,730
- In his study.
- Pacing.

686
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,860
Does that a lot.

687
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,900
- So you mean this map shows...
- Everyone. Everyone.

688
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,110
- Everyone, where they are.
- What they're doing.

689
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,410
- Every minute.
- Every day.

690
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,580
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- Nicked it from Filch's office of course.

691
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:32,500
- First year.
- Now listen, there are seven secret passageways...

692
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,330
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

693
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,670
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you straight to Honeyduke's Cellar.

694
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,670
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

695
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,260
Oh and Harry don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

696
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:48,760
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

697
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:26,300
Now, how much do you want?

698
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,520
Delicious.

699
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,610
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

700
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,450
Twice.

701
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,490
Do you want to move a bit closer?

702
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,410
To the Shrieking Shack?

703
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,580
Actually, I'm fine here.

704
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,580
Well, well. Look who's here.

705
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,250
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

706
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,760
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

707
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,180
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

708
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:15,600
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

709
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:19,230
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

710
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,400
You filthy little mudblood!

711
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:27,150
Who is that?

712
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,740
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

713
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:57,850
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

714
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,230
Get out of the way!

715
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,020
Move!

716
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,480
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

717
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,200
Harry!

718
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:18,410
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

719
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:22,830
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

720
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,460
Harry not gonna keep it. He gonna turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

721
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:30,670
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

722
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,340
Oh look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

723
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:35,850
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

724
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:37,890
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

725
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,430
Allow me, minister.

726
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,480
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

727
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,600
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

728
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:48,690
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

729
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:52,900
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

730
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,530
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

731
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:59,330
And what would bring him here?

732
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:03,660
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

733
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,580
Come.

734
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:10,130
Harry!

735
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:22,310
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

736
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,520
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

737
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,350
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!

738
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,730
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

739
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,400
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

740
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:38,490
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

741
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:43,080
Now tell me what this is all about.

742
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:47,710
Well now years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

743
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,540
Remember? They went into hiding.
Few knew where they were.

744
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:54,590
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

745
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,010
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

746
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,560
...but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew!

747
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:03,980
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

748
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,390
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- I remember.

749
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,400
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

750
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,320
- But what happened?
- Well Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters...

751
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:15,650
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

752
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:19,700
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

753
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:22,080
He destroyed him!

754
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:27,460
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

755
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:30,670
Yes Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

756
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,050
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- And now he wants to finish what he started.

757
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:37,090
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

758
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,050
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

759
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,390
...and remains to this day...

760
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:45,470
...Harry Potter's godfather!

761
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:56,400
Ron, look!

762
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,660
- Sorry, Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me, Sorry.
- Merry Christmas.

763
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,990
Harry, what happened?

764
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,620
He was their friend...

765
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,380
...and he betrayed them.

766
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:55,130
He was their friend!

767
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,340
I hope he finds me.

768
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:02,300
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

769
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,390
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

770
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:21,280
Harry.

771
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:23,450
There you are. You came.

772
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:27,700
Are you sure about this, Harry?
Now this is very advanced magic...

773
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:30,330
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

774
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,040
I'm sure.

775
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,080
Well, everything's prepared.

776
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:38,710
Now the spell I'm going to try and teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

777
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,380
Did you ever hear of it?

778
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:42,220
No? Well...

779
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:45,970
A Patronus is a kind of positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

780
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:50,810
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

781
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,810
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

782
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:58,940
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

783
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:02,950
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

784
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,370
Close your eyes.

785
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,040
Concentrate.

786
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:13,370
Explore your past.

787
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:15,750
Do you have a memory?

788
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,550
Allow it to fill you up.

789
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:22,340
Lose yourself within it.

790
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:28,010
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.

791
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,270
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.

792
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:38,400
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

793
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,830
Expecto Patronum!

794
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:02,960
Expecto... Expecto...

795
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:04,920
Expect...

796
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:11,010
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

797
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:15,100
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

798
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,650
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

799
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,360
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

800
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:27,320
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

801
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:30,660
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

802
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,450
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

803
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:37,330
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

804
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,880
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

805
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:53,970
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

806
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:58,060
Well, it is.

807
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:00,810
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

808
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:04,900
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?

809
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,160
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

810
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,700
Just do it.

811
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,010
Expecto Patronum!

812
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:34,180
Expecto Patronum!

813
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:56,910
Yes!

814
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:02,290
Well done, Harry. Well done!

815
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:06,960
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

816
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,550
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

817
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,510
And just so you know, Harry...

818
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,680
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

819
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:17,890
...is saying something.

820
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,060
I was thinking of him.

821
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,400
And Mum.

822
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,820
Seeing their faces.

823
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,150
They were talking to me.

824
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,570
Just talking.

825
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:35,070
That's the memory I chose.

826
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,160
I don't even know if it's real.

827
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,830
But it's the best I have.

828
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:53,380
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

829
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,550
Unless of course you've been ripped to pieces!

830
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,140
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

831
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:01,480
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

832
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,770
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

833
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:07,270
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

834
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,360
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

835
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:14,410
Well, maybe you should learn to
take better care of your pets!

836
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:16,660
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

837
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:18,330
- Did.
- Didn't.

838
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:23,000
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

839
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,460
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

840
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:29,300
...talking about why we were there.

841
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:33,840
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

842
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:36,970
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

843
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:40,220
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

844
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:43,600
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

845
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:46,810
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

846
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,810
And then?

847
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,230
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

848
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,530
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

849
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,620
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

850
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:34,030
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

851
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,780
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.

852
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:40,950
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

853
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:01,260
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

854
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:04,560
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.

855
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:07,230
He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!

856
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,780
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

857
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:06,160
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

858
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,960
Mischief managed. Nox.

859
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:20,510
Potter.

860
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,180
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

861
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:25,510
I was sleepwalking.

862
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,220
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

863
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:33,150
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

864
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:37,690
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

865
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,530
If you don't mind, I would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.

866
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,950
Turn out your pockets.

867
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:51,250
Turn out your pockets!

868
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:55,790
What's this?

869
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,210
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

870
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:09,470
Reveal your secrets.

871
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:14,730
Read it.

872
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:22,700
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

873
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:26,990
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

874
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,780
Go on.

875
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:33,830
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

876
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,580
- You insolent little...
- Professor!

877
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:40,920
Well, well. Lupin.

878
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:45,800
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?

879
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:49,600
Harry, are you all right?

880
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:52,270
That remains to be seen.

881
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,850
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

882
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:00,570
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

883
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:05,530
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

884
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,200
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

885
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:13,250
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

886
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:17,670
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

887
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:20,960
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

888
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:24,470
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

889
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,220
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

890
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,770
Come in.

891
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:46,780
I haven't the faintest idea Harry how this map
came to be in your possession...

892
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:51,450
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

893
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:55,290
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

894
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:57,460
...is a map to you?

895
01:17:58,290 --> 01:18:00,750
- No.
- No, sir.

896
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:05,800
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

897
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:10,300
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

898
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:15,020
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering around the castle unprotected...

899
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:19,650
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a pretty poor way to repay them!

900
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:22,020
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

901
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:24,650
- Harry, Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

902
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:28,490
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

903
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:33,410
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

904
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,500
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

905
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:48,340
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

906
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,510
Oh, really? And who might that be?

907
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,220
Peter Pettigrew.

908
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:57,930
That's not possible.

909
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,810
It's just what I saw.

910
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:05,360
Good night, professor.

911
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:13,030
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

912
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:18,620
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

913
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:22,120
Only then can you see. Try again.

914
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,750
Now, what do we have here?

915
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:29,300
Do you mind me trying?

916
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,680
The Grim, possibly.

917
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:40,940
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

918
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,900
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

919
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:48,990
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

920
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:52,820
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

921
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:56,990
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

922
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,290
...to which you so desperately cleave.

923
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,810
Have I said something?

924
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:27,480
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
I mean not that she wasn't always mental...

925
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:30,230
...but now it's out in the open
for everyone to see.

926
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,570
Hang on.

927
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,660
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

928
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:39,410
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

929
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:22,450
Harry Potter...

930
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:33,590
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

931
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,380
Sorry?

932
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:40,220
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

933
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:42,430
...shall break free.

934
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,850
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

935
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:51,020
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

936
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,620
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

937
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:03,200
No.

938
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,200
Nothing.

939
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,840
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

940
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,760
- It just got worse.
- Now What did I tell u? Father said...

941
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:09,100
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
Think I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

942
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:11,730
This is going to be rich.

943
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:14,110
- Look who's here.
- Ah! Come to see the show?

944
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:17,400
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

945
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:19,320
Hermione, no!

946
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,160
He's not worth it.

947
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,300
Malfoy, are you okay?

948
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:42,720
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

949
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:47,310
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

950
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:11,040
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

951
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:13,500
Why don't we just set him free?

952
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:16,090
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

953
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:19,260
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, you know? Dumbledore.

954
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:21,800
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

955
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,840
When it happens.

956
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:26,350
Great man, Dumbledore.

957
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:28,890
A great man.

958
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:34,350
- We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.
- You'll do no such thing!

959
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,690
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

960
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:41,530
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

961
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:51,330
Scabbers! You're alive!

962
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:55,210
- Keep a closer eye on your pet, Ron.
- I think you owe someone an apology.

963
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:59,130
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

964
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,380
I meant me!

965
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:03,300
Blimey. What was that?

966
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,180
Hagrid!

967
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,440
Oh, crikey.

968
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:18,650
No, minister. Over this way.

969
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:22,940
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

970
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:26,910
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

971
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:30,660
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

972
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,500
Quick. Quick!

973
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,420
Hagrid.

974
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:40,500
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

975
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:45,130
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.

976
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,970
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

977
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,850
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

978
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:54,890
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

979
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:59,560
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

980
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:03,110
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

981
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,860
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

982
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:11,200
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

983
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:16,870
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

984
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,590
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

985
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:25,170
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

986
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,090
What?

987
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,340
I thought I just saw...

988
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:31,640
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

989
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:39,060
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

990
01:27:25,570 --> 01:27:27,030
Oh, no.

991
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:40,160
He bit me. Scabbers.

992
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,710
Ron. Ron!

993
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:47,210
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

994
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:50,470
Wait!

995
01:27:56,390 --> 01:28:00,690
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

996
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:03,150
That's not good. Ron, run!

997
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:08,820
Harry, Hermione, run!

998
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,030
It's the Grim!

999
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:21,080
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1000
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:23,290
Harry!

1001
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,250
- Help!
- Ron!

1002
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:32,630
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1003
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,480
Come on!

1004
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,820
Move!

1005
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:58,620
Duck!

1006
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:36,780
Harry!

1007
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:55,680
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1008
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,760
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

1009
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:01,810
I just hope I'm wrong.

1010
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:24,660
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1011
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,370
Come on.

1012
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,140
Ron.

1013
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,310
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1014
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:45,730
Harry! It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1015
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:02,410
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1016
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:04,370
No. Only one will die tonight.

1017
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:06,500
Then it'll be you!

1018
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:14,880
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1019
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:17,920
Expelliarmus!

1020
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:25,810
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1021
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:29,060
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1022
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:33,270
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you Remus?

1023
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:44,740
- I found him.
- I know.

1024
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:46,200
- It's him.
- I understand.

1025
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:49,580
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1026
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,750
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1027
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:57,510
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1028
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,010
How long have you known?

1029
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:05,720
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well well well, Hermione.

1030
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:08,850
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1031
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:11,440
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1032
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,270
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

1033
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:16,860
Twelve years of it!

1034
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,860
In Azkaban!

1035
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:31,080
Very well. Kill him.

1036
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:35,420
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1037
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:37,170
I know why.

1038
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:39,630
You betrayed my parents.

1039
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,720
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, Harry, it wasn't him.

1040
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,800
Somebody did betray your parents...

1041
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:48,470
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1042
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:52,140
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1043
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:55,440
And he's in this room! Right now!

1044
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:58,900
Come out, come out, Peter!

1045
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:02,070
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!

1046
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:07,530
Vengeance is sweet.

1047
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,950
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1048
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,450
Severus...

1049
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:16,380
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
old friend into the castle and now here's the proof.

1050
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:17,880
Brilliant, Snape.

1051
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:22,420
Once again, You've put your keen and penetrating mind to the task
and as usual come to the wrong conclusion.

1052
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:25,300
Now if you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have some unfinished business...

1053
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:30,470
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

1054
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:33,230
- Severus, don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

1055
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:35,020
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself! Remus!

1056
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:37,610
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1057
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:40,320
Why dont you run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1058
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,360
I could do it, you know.

1059
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:49,450
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1060
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:52,330
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1061
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:56,000
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like to endure.

1062
01:33:56,170 --> 01:34:01,590
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

1063
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,050
Severus, please.

1064
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:07,090
After you.

1065
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:13,270
Expelliarmus!

1066
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:18,600
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1067
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:21,400
- Tell me about Peter Pettigrew.
- He was at school with us.

1068
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:23,230
We thought he was our friend!

1069
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,400
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1070
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:29,780
I thought so too, until you mentioned
seeing Pettigrew on the map!

1071
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:32,790
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1072
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:36,960
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1073
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:42,000
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

1074
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:45,420
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

1075
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:48,090
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1076
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:50,850
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

1077
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:53,970
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!

1078
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:57,440
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1079
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,650
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1080
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:06,320
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1081
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:07,570
Scabbers!

1082
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:10,820
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1083
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,140
Remus?

1084
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:37,390
Sirius.

1085
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,480
My old friends!

1086
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:48,950
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1087
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:52,780
- Like James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!

1088
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:56,240
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1089
01:35:56,450 --> 01:36:01,670
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort! didnt you?!
- I didn't mean to!

1090
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:04,670
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1091
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,510
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1092
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:13,470
- What would you have done?
- I Would rather die!,I Would have died, rather than betray my friends!

1093
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:18,020
Harry!, James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1094
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:23,900
Your dad..your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1095
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,570
Should have realized Peter!, if Voldemort
didn't kill you, then we would. Together!

1096
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,820
No!

1097
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:36,280
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.

1098
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:38,370
But we'll take him to the castle.

1099
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:43,580
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

1100
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,130
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1101
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,710
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1102
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:57,390
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1103
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:01,100
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1104
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:02,810
I was going for the rat.

1105
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:06,810
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

1106
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:12,240
In fact more than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1107
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:17,280
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1108
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,340
Okay.

1109
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:38,890
- You better go.
- No, No. Don't worry, okay?

1110
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,470
It's fine. I'll stay.

1111
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:43,230
You go, I'll stay.

1112
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,650
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1113
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:51,230
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1114
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,990
They might chop it.

1115
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:57,110
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1116
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:01,490
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1117
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:04,580
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1118
01:38:05,410 --> 01:38:09,170
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1119
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:13,050
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1120
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:18,010
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1121
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,970
He doesn't deserve it.

1122
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:24,310
Well I just didn't think my dad
would have wanted his two best friends...

1123
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,020
...to become killers.

1124
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:29,900
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1125
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:32,440
Alive, you're free.

1126
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:35,700
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1127
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:39,240
Ron! Haven't I been a good friend, a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1128
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:41,910
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1129
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:46,120
- Sweet girl, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

1130
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:50,500
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1131
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:54,760
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1132
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,880
I know.

1133
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:02,100
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1134
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:04,770
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1135
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:07,440
What? Come and live with you?

1136
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:11,900
Well, It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1137
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:13,650
Harry!

1138
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:32,750
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1139
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:39,430
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! This heart here!

1140
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:42,760
This flesh is only flesh!

1141
01:39:43,930 --> 01:39:46,020
Expelliarmus!

1142
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:57,650
Harry!

1143
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:01,700
Remus! Remus!

1144
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:10,250
Run! Run!

1145
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:22,300
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1146
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:27,560
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1147
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:29,980
Professor?

1148
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:35,610
Professor Lupin?

1149
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:46,620
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1150
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:49,580
There you are, Potter!

1151
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,410
Sirius!

1152
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,660
Come back here, Potter!

1153
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:34,890
Sirius!

1154
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:38,650
No. Sirius!

1155
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:23,400
Expecto Patronum!

1156
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:38,580
Harry?

1157
01:45:39,490 --> 01:45:41,870
I saw my dad.

1158
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,620
What?

1159
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:45,370
He sent the dementors away.

1160
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:46,960
I saw him across the lake.

1161
01:45:47,130 --> 01:45:48,790
Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1162
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,840
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1163
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:54,510
- You mean they're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1164
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,550
Much worse.

1165
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:59,100
They're going to suck out his soul.

1166
01:46:00,810 --> 01:46:02,180
Headmaster, you got to stop them.

1167
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:05,730
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true Sir. Sirius is innocent.

1168
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:08,110
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1169
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:09,650
He's my rat, sir.

1170
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:13,860
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1171
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:17,740
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

1172
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:20,450
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

1173
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:26,080
But im sorry to say the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1174
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:31,960
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1175
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:35,880
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1176
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:43,640
Mysterious thing, time.

1177
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:46,140
Powerful...

1178
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:49,190
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1179
01:46:50,770 --> 01:46:54,400
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1180
01:46:55,190 --> 01:46:57,320
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1181
01:46:57,490 --> 01:46:59,280
You must not be seen.

1182
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:03,120
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1183
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:06,830
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1184
01:47:07,370 --> 01:47:09,170
If you succeed tonight...

1185
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:12,170
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1186
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:16,220
Three turns should do it, I think.

1187
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,930
Oh, and by the way.

1188
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:28,940
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1189
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:31,190
Good luck.

1190
01:47:31,690 --> 01:47:34,150
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1191
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:37,150
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

1192
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:07,770
What just happened?

1193
01:48:07,930 --> 01:48:10,230
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1194
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:12,270
Where were we at 7:30?

1195
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:14,230
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1196
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,780
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1197
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:19,700
Hermione!

1198
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:40,550
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1199
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:45,930
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1200
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:48,980
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1201
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:50,480
That's us.

1202
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:53,600
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1203
01:48:53,810 --> 01:48:55,270
This is not normal.

1204
01:48:57,570 --> 01:48:59,940
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1205
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:02,320
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1206
01:49:02,490 --> 01:49:05,830
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1207
01:49:06,030 --> 01:49:09,250
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1208
01:49:09,410 --> 01:49:12,790
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1209
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:18,250
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1210
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,720
Good punch.

1211
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,390
Thanks.

1212
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:27,050
Malfoy's coming.

1213
01:49:27,970 --> 01:49:30,310
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1214
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:33,850
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1215
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:37,940
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1216
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,900
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1217
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:03,590
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1218
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,930
Of course.

1219
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:09,100
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1220
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:13,310
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1221
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,020
Let's go.

1222
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:38,420
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1223
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:41,090
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1224
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:43,710
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1225
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:47,130
Scabbers, you're alive!

1226
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:50,100
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1227
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:53,220
- Harry, you can't.
- Hermoine, He betrayed my parents.

1228
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:56,390
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1229
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:02,980
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1230
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:05,990
If you just go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1231
01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:09,030
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time, Harry.

1232
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:11,450
We can't be seen.

1233
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:16,460
Fudge is coming.

1234
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:19,460
And we aren't leaving?

1235
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:23,210
Why aren't we leaving?

1236
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:35,680
Are you mad?

1237
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:43,070
That hurt.

1238
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:44,610
Sorry.

1239
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:08,130
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1240
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,360
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1241
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:31,740
What?

1242
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:34,450
I thought I just saw...

1243
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:37,330
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1244
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:53,930
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1245
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:02,140
Get away. Get off.

1246
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:27,750
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1247
01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:31,760
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

1248
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:35,760
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1249
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:42,940
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1250
01:53:45,310 --> 01:53:49,110
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1251
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:53,240
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...

1252
01:53:53,610 --> 01:53:55,320
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1253
01:53:58,030 --> 01:54:01,000
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1254
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,500
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1255
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:10,630
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1256
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:12,510
- Now, look there.
- Where?

1257
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:16,090
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

1258
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:19,760
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1259
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:22,770
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

1260
01:54:23,730 --> 01:54:26,600
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

1261
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:27,940
- Over there.
- Where?

1262
01:54:28,110 --> 01:54:29,860
- Over there.
- This way.

1263
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:32,740
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

1264
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,110
But where is it?

1265
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:39,240
I saw the beast, just now.

1266
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:42,080
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

1267
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:43,580
Buckbeak.

1268
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:47,880
Oh c ome now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1269
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:49,380
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1270
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:53,840
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this. Hagrid

1271
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:56,880
After all how could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1272
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:58,930
- Right.
- Well, well.

1273
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:00,640
We must search the grounds.

1274
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:03,850
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1275
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:09,440
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1276
01:55:09,610 --> 01:55:13,610
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1277
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:15,650
Thank you.

1278
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:19,160
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1279
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,420
- Come on.
- This way.

1280
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:40,010
This way, now.

1281
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:44,180
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1282
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:46,890
- How?
- No idea.

1283
01:55:56,190 --> 01:55:58,570
- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!

1284
01:56:04,990 --> 01:56:07,000
And Snape's coming.

1285
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:14,880
And now we wait.

1286
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:17,880
And now we wait.

1287
01:56:45,450 --> 01:56:48,700
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

1288
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,290
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1289
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:57,800
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1290
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:00,090
...I did see someone.

1291
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:03,680
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1292
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:05,180
With a Patronus.

1293
01:57:05,350 --> 01:57:07,270
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1294
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:08,890
According to him...

1295
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:12,480
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1296
01:57:12,650 --> 01:57:14,520
It was my dad.

1297
01:57:15,650 --> 01:57:17,440
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1298
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:19,860
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

1299
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,610
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1300
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:29,370
Here we come.

1301
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,420
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1302
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:40,420
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.

1303
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:43,930
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1304
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:45,720
It'll just be me and him.

1305
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:48,350
We could live in the country...

1306
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:51,140
...someplace you can see the sky.

1307
01:57:51,310 --> 01:57:54,150
I think he'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1308
01:57:55,190 --> 01:57:56,730
Harry!

1309
01:57:58,270 --> 01:57:59,980
Run!

1310
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:08,410
Let's go.

1311
01:58:27,970 --> 01:58:30,310
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1312
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:35,940
Thanks.

1313
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:41,820
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1314
01:59:56,930 --> 01:59:58,690
That was so scary.

1315
01:59:58,850 --> 02:00:01,810
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1316
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:16,370
Sirius. Come on!

1317
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:34,510
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1318
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:37,890
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1319
02:00:46,610 --> 02:00:48,440
Any minute now.

1320
02:00:48,650 --> 02:00:50,700
Right there. You'll see.

1321
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:54,580
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1322
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:57,290
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1323
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:03,880
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

1324
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,800
...both of you.

1325
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:11,590
Harry!

1326
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:17,390
Expecto Patronum!

1327
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:17,580
You were right, Hermione.

1328
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:21,080
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1329
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:24,000
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1330
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:26,540
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1331
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:28,420
...well, I had already done it.

1332
02:02:28,590 --> 02:02:31,050
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1333
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:34,050
But I don't like flying...!

1334
02:02:47,190 --> 02:02:48,520
Bombarda!

1335
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:24,640
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1336
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:26,140
...to both of you.

1337
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:29,230
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1338
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:32,320
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1339
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,240
And besides...

1340
02:03:35,150 --> 02:03:38,450
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

1341
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:40,740
And you know it.

1342
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:43,700
And for now, that will do.

1343
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:48,580
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1344
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:52,130
...but you look so like your father.

1345
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:55,840
Except your eyes.

1346
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,090
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

1347
02:04:01,050 --> 02:04:06,140
It's cruel that I got to spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1348
02:04:06,730 --> 02:04:08,230
But know this:

1349
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:12,520
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1350
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:15,860
And you can always find them...

1351
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:20,110
...in here.

1352
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:33,040
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1353
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:01,490
We have to go.

1354
02:05:29,770 --> 02:05:32,440
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1355
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:34,150
Did what?

1356
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:36,270
Good night.

1357
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:46,370
How did you get there?

1358
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:49,200
I mean i was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1359
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:52,160
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

1360
02:05:52,330 --> 02:05:55,880
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1361
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:23,860
Hello, Harry.

1362
02:06:27,490 --> 02:06:29,330
I saw you coming.

1363
02:06:33,870 --> 02:06:36,580
I've looked worse, believe me.

1364
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:42,470
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1365
02:06:42,630 --> 02:06:45,590
No. I resigned, actually.

1366
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,550
Resigned? Why?

1367
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:53,020
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1368
02:06:53,180 --> 02:06:58,690
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1369
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:02,240
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1370
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:04,360
- But Dumbledore...
- Dumbledore has already...

1371
02:07:04,530 --> 02:07:06,410
...risked enough on my behalf.

1372
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:09,830
Besides, people like me are...

1373
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:13,790
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1374
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:25,930
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1375
02:07:26,090 --> 02:07:28,260
None of it made any difference.

1376
02:07:28,430 --> 02:07:31,970
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

1377
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:35,640
Harry, It made all the difference in the world.
You helped uncovered the truth.

1378
02:07:35,810 --> 02:07:38,310
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1379
02:07:38,690 --> 02:07:41,190
It made a great deal of difference.

1380
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:48,030
If I am proud of anything...

1381
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:50,870
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1382
02:07:51,030 --> 02:07:53,790
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1383
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:58,210
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1384
02:07:59,130 --> 02:08:01,630
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1385
02:08:01,790 --> 02:08:04,380
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1386
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:06,260
Until then...

1387
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:09,300
...mischief managed.

1388
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:47,760
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1389
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:49,340
Harry.

1390
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:51,550
Wherever did you get it?

1391
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:54,140
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1392
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:56,470
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1393
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:59,940
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1394
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:02,610
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1395
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:04,270
Did not.

1396
02:09:05,650 --> 02:09:09,150
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

1397
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:10,860
For me?

1398
02:09:11,030 --> 02:09:13,570
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1399
02:09:13,740 --> 02:09:15,660
This came with it.

1400
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,170
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

1401
02:09:22,330 --> 02:09:24,170
How fast is it, Harry?

1402
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:45,150
Lumos.

1403
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:47,730
I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.

1404
02:21:06,910 --> 02:21:08,710
Mischief managed.

1405
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:15,920
Nox.....
