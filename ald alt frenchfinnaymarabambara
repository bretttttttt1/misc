He made your observation .

His name is ALADDIN
Where the sun set the forest on fire in the distance lay an ancient mystery.
It is a long forgotten lamp buried in the sand.
It’s short and simple .
No fancy designs, no precious jewellery.
It seems boring and pointless to all but the smartest.
But this lamp isn't what it seems.
It was long the most powerful force in all of Arabia.
It changed the boy’s life forever.
A youth, like a lamp, was more than he looked.
The story begins on a dark night when a dark man with dark purposes awaits her. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
CHAPTER ONE
This man was Jafar and he was willing to wait.
His eyes were piercing and his spiky hair looked like a raven about to fight.
Parrot sat on his shoulder and shook his head impatiently.
Beneath him, his horse twitched and snarled furiously.
Treasure buried somewhere.
Only one person can have it: an old dog in two halves.
Jafar had half of it, soon there would be more.
And the property would belong to him.
And that being said he would be the most powerful man in Agrabah .
In the silence, Jafar heard the shuffling of feet as a rider approached.
The man was an ordinary thief named Gazeem, he admitted
Bring Jafar the other half of the dog in exchange for part of the treasure.
Jafar had made a promise. Jafar lied to him.
"You're late."
Gazeem dismounted and bowed his head.
Jafar was the vizier of the king, the chief advisor to the sultan. It wasn’t right to hurt him.
"Sorry, be patient," Gazeem said.
Jafar looked at him. "You got it then?" »
The robber smiled and took half a potato out of his pocket.
Jafar grabs him, but the robber stops him.
"And treasure? You said that."
Yell!
Parrot descended from Jafar's grasp, caught the club and threw it into Jafar's bones.
he is teaching
"Trust me," Jafar said. "You get what comes to you."
It quickly took half a winter.
Put the pieces together and the blood was flowing.
They were shining brightly. SO...
BOOMOOOOM that's good!
Thunder covered the desert.
The moth burst out of Jafar's hand as if it were alive.
He cut the drums with light.
Jafar encouraged his horse.
"Quick, follow the path!" he shouted in a loud voice.
Gazeem mounted his own horse and galloped towards Jafar .
Shining like a butterfly, the dog went through a small gap.
He spun it around and stood in mid-air.
K'ak'arata is!
The snow again divided the night into two halves, each half slowly devoured
p'yes he is.
Jafar stopped his horse and fled.
The singing dog looked at him with two eyes.
A sweet smile came over her.
Now there was no turning back.
RRRRRRRMMMMmmmm ye ye!
The ground began to shake.
Strange eyes shone brightly.
Gazeem collapsed in terror.
Gradually the rock began to grow.
It grew on all sides, it changed its form.
The eyes remained, now the ears came out, then the nose.
In laban there are wulila ka da wuli.
A column of white light erupted from within, nearly blinding Jafar.
Now the stone looked like the face of a lion, roaring in pain.
Jafar looked shocked.
His frightened parrot grabbed his arm, gnawing at it in its claws.
"Thank God!" Gazeem whispered. "Cut God!"
"Finally, back!" Jafar told his parish. "After all my years of research, Wonder Cave!"
"Awk," Lago growled. "Wonderful hole!"
Jafar approached Gazeem .
"Now remember," he hissed.
“Bring me a lamp.
The treasure is yours now, but the lamp is mine!
Gazeem swallowed hard .
He turned towards the mouth of the tiger god and began to walk slowly.
"Awk! Oh lamp!" Lago repeated it loud enough for Gazeem to hear.
Then he leaned into Jafar's ear and whispered, "Damn, where did you get that bozo?"
—¡Shh! "" Jafara snapped.
Lago told no one that he could speak for himself, indeed no one besides his master.
But now Jafar refuses to listen.
He looked around.
Watch and wait.
"Who's fighting the dream!" growled the dragon god, his voice again echoing on the ground.
"Um...I am, Gazeem, a little thief."
Her voice was a terrified scream and her knees were weak and shaky.
"Look at that!" he said to the lion god. "Only one person can get here."
Whose garments conceal a pure heart – In a rough diamond! »
Gazeem looked back hopefully .
"Jack is that!" ordered Jafar.
Qazeem turned sheepishly to the edge of the cave.
A staircase leads down to... what? He wouldn’t say that. He started down calmly.
RRRRRAAAAAUUQQHHHHHH!
The roar of the lion god’s thunder was nothing Jafar had ever heard before.
Gazeem's cry was heard for a moment, and the lion god's mouth was closed,
it shuts the thief up forever.
"Get that diamond in the wood!" commanded the lion god
Gradually the rock became flat.
The half-holes were melted and squeezed.
Jafar watched in silence as Lago emerged on the mountain dove and slick sand.
He gathered the half-dogs back to Jafar .
"I can't believe that!" The section said that. "We'll never get a chance to get our hands on that stupid lamp!"
"Patience, back, patience. Gazeem was no good apparently."
"Now, what a surprise!" said Lake, rolling his eyes. "What are we going to do? We're serious."
the problem here—”
But Jafar reached out and turned away. He needed peace.
“Only one comes in…” he said. "I have to find this, this diamond in the sand."
A rough diamond—Jafar understood what it meant.
An ordinary man, poor and dirty, he had good qualities.
There was only one way to get the man, and Jafar knew exactly how to do it.
A devilish smile spread across his face.
He didn’t get rich tonight, but that didn’t matter.
It was close—oh so close.
And soon the wait was over.
SARA PEOPLE
Don't stop, son!
The guard yelled at the top of his lungs as he chased the scantily clad boy through the crowd.
Agrabah is the market.
The boy zigzagged deftly through the outdoor stalls: fruit vendors, clothiers, bakers, inquirers.
for the customers.
In his right hand he holds a loaf of bread.
next to him ran a monkey wearing a jacket and hat.
I'll take you, street dog!” the guard shouted.
Love the street. If there was one name Aladdin hated, this was it.
The Sultan's guards looked down on the poor of Agrabah, like him.
In fact, he sometimes stole food.
He had no choice: he had to eat.
But he wasn’t just a street dog.
"Come on, Abu!" Aladdin called out to his pet monkey.
He ran to a nearby house and jumped onto a low, flat roof.
He and Abu ran from roof to roof.
lands on a towel and finally throws away a soft towel.
Suddenly he grabbed her hairy hands.
It was Rasoul, the commander of the Sultan’s guard.
Rasoul was a man of few words, but if he had one thing, it was the arrest of young thieves.
"I found you!" Rasoul said as he took Aladdin's.
Abu jumped into Rasoul's arms and pulled the guard's hat over his eyes.
Aladdin is quickly freed and he and Abu escape.
They passed a camel vendor, a carpet vendor, a jewelery cart in the middle of the market.
Suddenly, Abou stopped.
The monkey’s eyes are glued to the cart.
Abu had one major weakness: sparkly jewelry.
He sat down beside the carriage and reached out to steal the pendant.
"Protect her!" someone shouted.
The ten faces turned to Abu.
Aladdin came back. He grabbed Abu by the neck.
On the right, the guards struggled to get close.
On the left, angry citizens approached.
Aladdin and Abu ran up the stairs leading to the main floor.
Then they ran down the stairs and out the window.
Aladdin took the rug as a parachute and jumped from window to window with Abu.
on the side of the building.
They jumped again, this time landing safely in a narrow alley that covered the Sultan’s palace.
Treat snakes.
There, the voices of the market died.
Aladdin took a deep breath and sat down. He was hungry for food.
"Alright Abu, let's have fun now!" he said, breaking his bread in half.
But before he can eat, he sees a strong boy and girl in the darkness.
They said nothing, but their large, piercing eyes spoke for them.
Aladdin knew they hadn't eaten in days.
He looked at the bread. He'd risked his life to get her, and his mouth was watering like crazy. But he is the one
I couldn't let hunger go.
He bragged and gave it to half the children.
"Come on, take it," he said softly.
Abu frowned but also gave him his money. The girl is smiling.
He took Abu's bread and crushed it gently.
Abu is the best. People did not treat him that way.
He proudly took his hat and walked away – knocking Aladdin right under his feet.
But Aladdin did not notice. His face was fixed forward.
"Wow…" Aladdin mumbled.
The city was quiet.
There was a man in the middle of the room. She was dressed in a fine silk gown embroidered with jewels.
As people cleared the road and knelt down, the man proudly raised his mouth in the air.
Aladdin stepped out onto the sidewalk towards the crowd. Everyone was talking about the rich
mies.
"It's King Ahmed, on the road to the palace," he said.
"Just a suitor for the princess," an old man shrugged.
"He got engaged and he dumped her, just like everyone else."
Aladdin looked at him in surprise. If a princess could refuse someone like that, she would be a wonderful girl!
Aladdin felt his leg fall. Abu threw it towards the crowd. Aladdin is a bunch of poor people
the children are too close to King Ahmed’s house.
Suddenly the horse galloped away, frightening the children, and the king shouted, "Get out of my way, you old man."
children!"
Aladdin angrily stormed through the crowd and stood before King Ahmed .
"If I were as rich as you," he cried, "I could make a good living!"
"Get out of my way, you street dog bite dog!" Prince Ahmed kicks his horse and shoots Aladdin,

trying to suppress the smiles of laughter.
"Taa..." Jafar ko.
Abu was inches away from Lago now – and Lago backed away.
Jasmine quickly wrapped her arms around Jafar and locked him in place.
"You're well dressed," he continued. "You stole my heart."
With a swift leap he seized Abu Lago's chair and extended his hand.
into his mouth. They both fell to the ground.
"What's a street dog?" Jafar said as he approached Jasi.
"Any street dogs?" Jasmine asked,
¡That’s a lot of trouble! Abu and Lago snuggled up at the table and let the bowl go
jukɔrɔ.
Jafar started to back away. Jasmine couldn't help but get closer
and kissed her passionately on the lips.
Now Aladdin has a chance. But he couldn't get up. All that he is

Jafar took a step back . He was so surprised to see his reasoning

"YOU!" he returned in blind rage. His arm was broken

"How many times do I have to kill you, boy!" Jafar said it was him

Jamsine grinned at him and threw her hand away.
"You traitorous brat!" Jafar sighed. "Your time is up!"
He waved his wand at Jasmine. He was immediately arrested a

fell through the opening

Zzzzz that’s a great show! Jafar diverts Abu away from his cane and mounts a toy monkey that eats the tray.
Zzzzz that’s a great show! The carpet began to tear. Aladdin runs to stop him. Jafar is a great city
" he shouted, "Things change fast, baby.
"It's all your fault, street dog! Never come back!"
Zzzzzzz that’s amazing! Aladdin jumped back. The sword struck the ground
beside him, and another. He looked around. Dozens of razors
swords fell from the ceiling.
Jafar made another gesture and a wall of fire rose from the ground.
Aladdin grabbed one of the swinging swords. “Are you afraid to hit me

Jafar walked towards Aladdin, forcing him closer to the fire.
"Snake, huh? Maybe you want to see how I can look like a snake!"
Jafar waved his snake staff with both hands. It began to grow,

With an unearthly cry, Jafar stepped forward. Aladdin swung his sword.
Glow up! He knocked out two of Jafar's teeth, which fell to the ground after being hit.
"Rickum-rackum, throw this sword at the snake," said the spirit
he shouted in a loud voice.
"Get out of here!" » » Jafar sighed. He lunged again loudly
Aladdin is in town. The sword flew out of his hand.
"Below!" exclaimed the Sultan, looking wistfully from above. "Jasmine!"
Aladdin saw the hour and went away. Sand
he stood up quickly, covering everything except Jasmine's head.
Without his sword, there was only one option. Aladdin ran away

Aladdin drew his sword and ran towards the lectern .
Jasmine's eyes widened in fear.
Aladdin drew his sword, ready to shatter the galaxy.
Jafar throws him into the wall with a powerful boom . He was free…
he turned his reels to Aladdin.
Aladdin's sword caught in the middle. It was hard for him to escape.
"I thought he could beat the strongest man on earth!"
shouted Jafar.
Aladdin ran left and right . Inside the house, genius
he seemed helpless.
Nɛro!
Thinking quickly, Aladdin said, "You're not that strong, Genie."
he was not stronger than before! It empowers you, too
I can get it out!”
Genie hid behind a pillar. "Al, what are you doing? Why?"
Are you dragging me here? »
"Look at that, Jafar, you're still second," Aladdin continued.
Jafar got his bike. He turned his furry face to the demons.
"Indeed. He's stronger than me, but he doesn't last!"
Aladdin falls to the ground as Jafar rolls off the ground.

Quickly Aladdin took his sword and broke the lark.
Jasmine pushed forward into a gap. "Whatever you have."
Is it meant to be that way?” he asked, as Aladdin released him.
Aladdin smiled. He said: 'Trust me.
"The world is an open book to me!" Jafar shouted . " Mining," he said

to the sky.
Before he could say a word, the gold chains wrapped themselves around his body.

"What? What's going on?" Jafari asked the question.
"Do you want to be smart?" Aladdin picked up a new lantern and.

"No, I'm not!"
Jafar shouted, raising his hands. Their hands

With a boring voice! Jafar and Lago were pulled into the lamp.
Everyone in the throne room fell into a deep silence. Jasmine , 1999 .
The sultan, with a wise soul, looked at Aladdin.
"Phenomenal cosmic powers," Aladdin said shrugging his shoulders. "Toddler

Genie laughed out loud. "Al, you smart little one!"
Immediately the house began to return to normal. Getting back on his feet, .
The Sultan shouted in delight as he was stripped of his clothes. Abu
became a living monkey again. Rajah became a tiger again, and broke
a little out of the cage. And the carpet looked new.
Genie grabbed the flashlight and went to the balcony.
"Shall we go? Let's winter in Wonder Cave for ten thousand years."

Overjoyed, the demon ran away. He had a great face, .

Later that day when Agrabah returned

Aladdin said softly, “Jasmine, I lied to you….
prince —it’s hard.
Jasmine shook her head. "I know why."
"I thought this was a greeting?"
Jasmine turned away. "This stupid rule! It's unfair!" Now,
he cried and looked back at Aladdin. "I love you."
Suddenly, a spirit appeared in the window. “Al, it’s okay…
There is only one desire. Speak the word and you will be king again!
"But Genie," Aladdin said. "And you're free?"
"Al, n b'i deli."
for millions of years. Believe me, I was watching."
Aladdin stared at Jasmine. He knew what the cost was
now it means salvation. Not Genius’s, but Jasmine’s – and therefore
he himself did it. Like he had to do it
To escape the Sultan’s orders, Aladdin had to be free. To be free to be
he himself did it.
Finally, he said, "Jasmine…I love you." “But I can't pretend I am
because I am not like that.
Jasmine lowered her head. "I understand."
"Genie," said Aladdin, "I want you to be free."
I began to keep my promise.
The golden arms of spirit disappeared in an instant. He was very surprised. "Fast!
Anything interesting, anything! "I ride the Nile!" »
"Oh, I wait for the Nile," said Aladdin.
"SEVERAL!" the spirit said with a smile. "I am free!" and he grew up, and came
his face lights up. "I'm free! I'm going to explore the world!"
"Pat's in the back!" said the Sultan, looking back.
"I like you, Qenie," Aladdin said.
"Me too Al," the spirit replied quietly. “Whatever it is
they all say you will be a boss to me! »
"Adequate!" the sultan agreed.
"You've shown me it's really good for me. If hardship is law, what is it?"
we need new laws!
Jasmine looked at him in shock. "Father!"
"From now on, the princess will marry whomever she thinks fit!"
"I chose you, Aladdin!" Jasmine cried immediately.
Aladdin was delighted. “Call me Ali,” she said.
He and Jasmine laughed.
Aladdin took her hand and they both started walking around the balcony.
"OK!" “I can do no more harm here,” said the spirit with a great smile.
And now I want to get out of here!
Well, you dark lovers! »
Nero sent it into the sky like a missile.
The Sultan followed it with his eyes till the spirit disappeared in the sky.
Aladdin and Jasmine didn't even notice he was gone.
While they were in a long, dreamlike kiss, they didn't pay much attention to anything but each other.

GAZEEM: We had to cut a couple of lips to get it. (Now it’s out

WHAT YOU CAN DO: Stop, thief! I will take the cup from your hand, .
        sorry rat!
ALADDIN: (Looks behind him, then down, then at the bread.) Everything
        is that a bread ?

MYTH 1: There it is!
OPTION 2: You can’t run that easy!
ALADDIN: You think that's easy?

(Looks at the three women mockingly).

CONCEPT 1: You two, this road, and you and me. OK
        Please seek it out.

(ALADDIN puts a sheet over it and covers it for concealment.
    He runs into women.)

ALADDIN: Hello, ladies.
WOMAN 1: You're in a bit of trouble this morning, aren't you?
        Aladdin is us?
ALADDIN: A problem? You are welcome. You can only get in trouble

(A hand grabs ALADDIN's arm and pulls him back. That's right

ALADDIN: I'm in trouble!
GUARD: ...and this time--(shouting voice from ABU,
        the guard's hat falls on him
        ABU eyes whip VALVO in the head, laughing.)
ALADDIN: Perfect time, Abu!
ASHES: Hee!
ALADDIN: Come on, let's get out of here!
        I have to stay...one jump before the end
        One step before the sword
        I just stole what I couldn't have
        That’s the whole thing!

(ALADDIN fights a sword-wielding EXPLOSION. He dodges a few

    but it also destroys the fish barrel. Like ALADDIN SEEING MONEY, TO PROTECT IT

        He has moved on from law enforcement
        It is, and it’s no joke
        These guys don't want me broke!

(ALADDIN and ABU run over a stack of barrels, then one barrel.

GUARDS: (together) Riffraff! Damn your mouse!
        Charlatan is the best! You have to take it!
ALADDIN: Snack, gentlemen!

(ALADDIN runs up the stage. THE GUARDS shudder
    the level goes on and on again trying to destroy it.)

GUARDS: Tear it up, send it back guys!
ALADDIN: I've got a hint, I must face the truth s
        ¡Juma sapakïtawa, Abu!
WOMAN: Who?!?

(ALADDIN jumps dead off the stage to catch the ABUs.
    his hands are acrobatic . Two couples form a harem.)

        Oh, it’s sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom
        He becomes single, he increases the evil

(ABU gets a bowl full of fruit and puts his mouth in it and.
    Kɔsɛbɛ.)

WOMAN: I'd blame the parents, but they don't have it!
ALADDIN: I must eat and live, I must fly and eat
        I will tell you all about it when I have time!

(ALADDIN and ABU leave. Cut to MUSCLEMAN leaning into the crowd
    APYT is quickly released. Cut to ALADDIN and ABU after MUSCHEMMAN,
     so consistent with his practice that he makes mistakes and catches.)

        Slow down a bit and slow down a bit and jump forward
        Stepping out of my misery
        Next time I will use the pen name.
        He passes forward hitters
        One step ahead of the pack
        I think I'll take a walk around the neighborhood.

PEOPLE: Stop it, thief! Vandal is the best!

ALADDIN: Which one told?

(ALADDIN is surrounded by GUARDS in front of the door. The door opens
    came out of a huge, ugly LADY.)

LADY: Still, I think it's interesting

(ALADDIN sits up and wraps his arms around her and remembers her as she moves
    as if they were all friends.)

ALADDIN: I must eat and live, I must fly and eat
        Otherwise, we'll get along!
GUARDS: DO NOT!

(Everyone jumps up and fights. When they stop, ALADDIN and.
    ABU left the scene. They fall into the barrel. They run and run
    through a burning hole, and then the RUMINERS crawl up and down, .
    stones crack and burst under pressure. ALADDIN is ABU
    continued ua SWORD SHOT, ABU returned, and drew the sword
    From the mouth of NIELIJA. The ABU advances to the guards,
    who retreat in fear.)

OPINION 1: He has a sword!
GUARD 2: You idiot, we ALL have swords!!

(ABU makes sure to lower his sword and run. So are ALADDIN and ABU
    around again, and the PELENS come left and right.
      He jumps and climbs a street-level dressage,
     with the GARDW shooting at each other.)

ALADDIN: One foot forward toe tight!
PEOPLE: Vandal!
ALADDIN: One hand forward!
PEOPLE: Street dogs!
ALADDIN: A trip before trouble
PEOPLE: You are scum!
ALADDIN: They're fast, but I'm fast
PEOPLE: Take it!

(The GUARDS lead ALADDIN up the stairs to his room. He has.
     carpet and window outlet) .

ALADDIN: Come on, I'd better get my hands on it
        I want you to land safely
        All I have to do is jump!

(The GUARDS chase him through the window, but they go right down
     in a group of streets and lands with a sign that reads “Hakim in the Dark” .
    Discount luggage” now. ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute
    to land safely. ALADDIN and ABU compliment each other
    ka fee.)

ALADDIN: And now, sir, feast! Light!

(ALADDIN divides the bread in half and gives half to ABU, who begins
    eat. But ALADDIN looked up and saw two little children
    Foraging in garbage cans . Then IMPAX sees it
    he throws away what he finds and tries to hide. Then ALADDIN looked at them
    hurry, ani ABU.)

ABU: That’s right!

(ABU takes a bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks away
    in the case of children. The girl takes out her brother.)

ALADDIN: Do it, yes.

(Children laugh happily. ABU tries to eat potatoes,
    and blame you. He is close to the children and they are his
     bread for them. They patted his head with delight).

ABU: Ah, don't do that. Or did he see her ?

(ABU watches ALADDIN enter the daylight where the parade is taking place
    passes.ALADDIN looks over the shoulders of the crowd. He's seeing it
    PRINCE ACHMED is on horseback.)

PASSENGER 1: On Palace Road, I guess.
BYSTANDER 2: Another sucker for the princess.

(ALADDIN is startled when two children run out of the house.
    in the street. THE BOY ran before the PRINCE house, .
    surprise him.)

PRINCE: Get out of my way, brat!

(The PRINCE raises his whip and attacks the children, but ALADDIN
    jump in front of them and grab the beating.)

ALADDIN: Hey, if I were as rich as you, I'd buy some customs
PRINCE: Oh... N b'i kalan that's right!

(The PRINCESS throws ALADDIN into a pit. The audience laughs at her).

ALADDIN: Look, Abu. We don't see it every day a
        a horse with two backyards!

(PRINCE stands facing ALADDIN.)

PRINCE: You're a useless street dog. I was born
        street dog , you are a dead street dog , and that is it
        your dogs will cry for you.

(ALADDIN runs to the king, but the castle is locked
    showed on his face.)

ALADDIN: I'm not fucking. And I don’t have dogs. Come
        Go ahead, Abu. Let's go home.

(ALADDIN enters his room and sees the vision back
    ABU night.)

ALADDIN: Riffraff, katrotta.
        N ma a san.
        If only they had looked closer
        Are they a poor boy? Not the father.
        They would know there was more to me.

(Pulls back the curtain to reveal a beautiful palace).

        One day Abu, things will change. Health
        rich , I live in a palace and have never had a problem
        everyone should be.

(It rises to one level during the day. Photograph of the interior of the SULTAN's bedroom.
     The door suddenly opens and PRINCE ACHMED flees, disappearing
    behind the pants.)

PRINCE: I've never been so embarrassed!

SULTAN: Oh Prince Ahmed. You wouldn’t leave so soon, would you?
        Juma?

PRINCE: Good luck marrying her!

SULTAN: Oh Jasmine! Jasmine is doing well! Jasmine is doing well! (The SULTAN leaves
        goes to the garden in search of his daughter. THE
        received, but cut off by RAJAH, son of JASMINE.
        a pet stops him. RAJAH is a symbol
        from the robes of the king to his mouth.SULTAN
        grabs the cloth and pulls it out of the RAJAH's mouth.)
        To hell with you, Rajah! That's why Prince Ahmed did it
        fight!
JASMINE: Oh, Daddy. The Rajah was playing with him,
        Unless you are a Rajah. (RAJAH approaches him and replies
        JASMINE reaches out and kisses him.) You were kidding
        this overdressed and haughty Prince Ahmed, .
        Isn't that true ? (She smirks at RAJAH, pleased
        until he looked at his angry father for a moment. )
        Mmm.
SULTAN: My dear, you must stop ignoring all married couples
        which will be called. The law says so.
BOTH: ...to marry a prince.

(He heads towards the pigeon cage).

SULTAN: Until next birthday.
JASMINE: The law is wrong.
SULTAN: Just three days!
JASMINE: Dad, I hate this. (He takes it
        the dove came out of the cage and squawked.) When I get married, .
        I want it out of love.
SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not just this rule. (He puts his hand on her
        pigeon, he puts it back in the cage.) Not me
        It's going to last forever and I just want to do it
        trust that you will be taken care of, hopefully.
JASMINE: Try to understand. I never do anything to myself
        own. (She puts her hand around the water
        back, fish petting.) I've never been honest
        friends. (RAJAH smirks at him).
        Unless like you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he returned
        sleep.) I never left the palace
        in the walls
SULTAN: But Jasmine, you are a princess.
JASMINE: Well, maybe I don't want to be a princess. (THE
        water is sprinkled.)
SULTAN: Oooohhh! May Allah protect you
        demisânnin demisânw !

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a moment. JASMINE goes towards the dove.
    open the cage and door. People are running for their lives.
      He watches them go. The value of the int. from the SULTAN's court.)

SULTAN: I don't know where he got it. He doesn't
        it wasn’t that difficult. (An earthquake falls on him.
        She looks up in surprise, and sees JAFAR.) Ooh, oh.
        Ah, Jafar, my most trusted mentor. I want to be there
        your knowledge is necessary.
JAFAR: My whole life is to serve you, sir. (He bows his head).
SULTAN: He looks like this pretender. Jasmine refused
        choose your husband. I am at the end of the row.
IAGO: (in a parrot voice) Aww! Turning the head .
SULTAN: Ah, yes, yes. Good luck, pretty Polly! (E
        takes a cookie out of her pocket. IAGO is waiting
        with much fear. The SULTAN then introduces IAGO
        to enter the mouth. IAGO blushes as he tries to eat. JAFAR'S FACEBOOK
        and both SULTANI laugh.)
JAFAR: His Majesty must have trouble with gentle animals.
        (IAGO looks at him.) Now maybe I can
        see how to solve this complex problem.
SULTAN: The only one who can help is you.
JAFAR: Ah, but I had to use mystical blue for that
        diamond set diamond.
SULTAN: Oh, my ring? But he has remained in the family ever since
        sanw.
JAFAR: We need to find a mate for the princess.
        (JAFAR emphasizes the word "princess".
        the second word "cess". He spun his wand around
        and the head of the cobra turns towards the SULTAN. The eyes of the
        the rod begins to glow. The room is dark, JAFAR's room
        the language goes deeper and deeper. The eyes of the SULTAN
        looking mesmerized.) Don't worry. All
        it is very useful.
SULTAN: Everything will be fine.
JAFAR: Nka diamantw.
SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Everything you need is well laid out.

(The SULTAN takes the ring and gives it to JAFAR. The room lights up
    restore when JAFAR removes the rod.)

JAFAR: You are very kind, Liege. Now let's run through the.
        play with your little toys.
SULTAN: (Still hypnotized) Yes... that's... very interesting.

(JAFAR and IAGO leave. We follow them. As he leaves the room,
    parrot slurping cookies.)

IAGO: I can't take it anymore! I have to be crazy about it
        other than those soft, ugly cookies... bam!
        I'm fighting!

(JAFAR pulls out a rope, revealing a hidden entrance to their house).

JAFAR: Calm down, Iago.
IAGO: Then I grabbed his head. Beat! Beat!
JAFAR: (Speaking to IAGO.) I'm being Sultan, right
        aka idiot confusé.
IAGO: And then I threw the cookies in his mouth! Huh
        ¡Hah!

(Two couples enter the door and giggle. Diss. towards the garden.
    evening. A dark man walked through it. We see it's JASMINE
    it does a lot of things. He reached the palace wall and began to climb it.
      RAJAH threw it behind him.)

JASMINE: Oh, I mean, Rajah. But I can't stay here and.
        Life must be lived for me. I will miss you. (THE
        starts climbing again and RAJAH helps him,
        who starts coughing and groaning.) Thank you!

(Disappeared over the wall. Picture of the sun on ALADDIN street
    and the ABU is ready to push again. They are upstairs
    fruit stand fabric.)

ALADDIN: Do it, Object. That's it!

(ABU dives and looks DOWN.)

REPRESENTATIVE: (To the Master) Do it, sweets
            dances, songs. (ABU is a melon with.
            he hangs there confused.) Hey, .
            remove it from the top.
ABU: Blah blah!
REPRESENTATIVE: Well you! Get out of here you filthy monkey!

(He takes the melon out of ABU's hand. But in the foreground, ALADDIN
    he bends over and plucks another melon from the trees.)

ABU: Good morning!

(She gets up. THE STATUS comes with a melon in front of her,
    where he places it on the hill. He looks confused
    he just did it.)

ALADDIN: Very well, Abu. Breakfast will be provided.

(ALADDIN and ABU open a melon on the roof and eat it. J. .
    ASMINE walks down the street.)

SHOP 1: Good lady, buy a bowl. There is no finer metal tool
            walima wari.
SELLER 2: Sweet dates, sweet dates and figs! Sugar
            pistachio date!
SHOP 3: Should a woman wear a necklace? Nice
            a necklace for a beautiful woman.

(He loves the process, but is surprised by the fish’s attack
    showed on his face.)

4 SHOP: Fresh fish! We caught them, you bought them!
JASMINE: I don't think so. (It is reversed, but destroyed
        a fire-eater who marvels at eating his own
        fire.) Excuse me. (Swallows before vomiting
        fire comes out of his mouth. JASMINE IS INSIDE. Saw
        smiling and rubbing her stomach. ALADDIN saw him,
        and a strange look appears on his face.) It's me
        concerning indeed.
ALADDIN: (Obviously loving it.) Wow!

(He throws his jacket over Hupu's head. ABU sees this and.
    he jumps into his arms , waving his hand in front of ALADDIN
    face.)

ABU: That’s a great example. Good morning? Good morning?

(JASMINE stops at a fruit stand and sees a homeless kid.
    you are looking for a solution. He takes one and gives it to her
    juparu.)

JASMINE: Oh, you must be hungry. Here’s what’s there. (THE
            the young man ran away.)
HOPE: You better be able to pay.
JASMINE: (Mixed) Jig?
BELOW: No one stole the basket!
JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I don't have any money.
REPRESENTATION: Son!
JASMINE: Please, if you'll let me go to the palace, I'll go
            receiving from the sultan.
HOPE: Do you know the penalty for stealing?

(He deliberately grabs her arm and pins her to the table
    stop.)

JASMINE: Ayi, ayi, barika Ala ye!

(The sword is thrown, but is stopped by ALADDIN'S hand).

ALADDIN: Thank you, good sir. I'm so glad you found it
            your. I'm looking for you everywhere.
JASMINE: ( giggling) What are you doing?
ALADDIN: (chuckles back) Kidding.
HOPE: Do you know this girl?
JASMINE: Most likely, yeah. She is my sister. It’s just a little bit
            mad. (He wraps his arms around his ears.
            It’s annoying. HOPE seized him
            ch'alla.)
BOTTOM: He says he knows Sultan!
ALADDIN: He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

(ABU packs his bags. Hearing this he wakes up.
    JASI, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.) JASI.

JASMINE: Oh clever Sultan. ¿How can I serve you?
ABU: Tena, blaa blaa blaa.
ALADDIN: Sad, huh? (She leans forward and selects her juke
            take another one from the cart
            foot.) But no harm done. (He walks towards the woods
            Jasi.) Come now sister. O bɛ Weele ko time to see
            lääkäri and so on.
JASMINE: (to a camel standing nearby) O ka di.
            How does it go about?
ALADDIN: No, no, no. Not this one. (for ABU, incl
            the bags are fluttering.) Come, Sultan and juk'.

(Abu bows before the people and everything he has stolen from the cart may fall on the katu jukampaminaka .
    slang.)

REPRESENTATIVE: Is it good? What is this? (Which the ABU can review
            bear, running all three of them.) Come back here, .
            you little thieves!

(Cut to the interior of the JAFAR lab. IAGO spins a gear in a strange manner.
    gadgets in the field. A storm will blow over the ship).

IAGO: (blushing and gasping) With all due respect, yours
        rotten, can we not expect a real cold?
JAFAR: Hold your breath, Iago. It’s much faster than that! (And he sat down
        THE SULTAN'S RING is on board.)
IAGO: Yes, oh terrible.

(IAGO runs swiftly. The fire crosses to the ring, and passes forward
    clockwise drawing The middle begins to rise.)

JAFAR: Ah, the mists of time, show me who can do that
        into the hole. (The soil at the bottom makes a hole
        To do wonders. He fell in a storm, but he
        shows ALADDIN climbing a ladder in pursuit
        JASMINE, locked in her jacket.) Yeah, yeah!
        Here’s what’s there. My diamond is hard!
IAGO: Is that him?!?! That’s what a clown is
        are you waiting ( IAGO steps away , forced to suck
        located in the gearbox.)
JAFAR: The guards send him a call
        masao, ɔnhɔn?

(IAGO crosses over and bangs the head against the wall).

IAGO: Well done.

(JAFAR laughs menacingly, the camera zooms in on the dust storm
    In the ALADD. Finally, we focus on the ALADDIN test itself
    escalier patat JASMINE sigilen chachan arktasa.)

ALADDIN: I'm already there.

(JASMINE continues, but stumbles and falls into ALADDIN's arms.
    A wulila.)

JASMINE: I want to thank you for catching this guy.
ALADDIN: Forget it. (Grabs the stick.) So, so
        first time on the market?

(ALADD pole-jumps to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE: So, obviously?
ALADDIN: Well, you're right. (He looked up at her,
        with great affection. He turns his face back to her. But he is the one
        he knows what he's doing, and he's back to normal.)
        I mean you wouldn't know how bad it is
        Agrabah would be it. (Puts the pan in the middle
        in horses he can walk but when stooped
        he jumped on his head inside. He looks behind him
        suddenly. He threw her a stick. Both
        ALADDIN and ABU's eyes widen.)
JASMINE: I'm a fast learner.
ALADDIN: That's right. Come here. (They are coming up
        away from the house, the boards and the trees
        and.) Huh. Leave your head there . Be careful.
JASMINE: Do you live here?
ALADDIN: Yes. I am with Abumpiki. Come, go as you please.
JASMINE: Very interesting.
ALADDIN: Well, not much, (draws curtain and.
        shows the palace), but gives a spectacular view.
        The palace looks really nice, doesn’t it?
JASMINE: Oh, that’s lovely.
ALADDIN: I wonder what it would be like to live there
        there are slaves and servants…
JASMINE: That’s good. People who tell you where to go and how to get there
        this is this.
ALADDIN: Much better than this place. They are always looking for food
        and avoid the guards.
JASMINE: You're not free to make up your own mind.
ALADDIN: Sometimes it does.
JASMINE: You just are.
BOTH: (together) – arrested.

(They look at each other and sense each other’s perfection
    second. But ALADDIN knew where he was and destroyed it
    Cure. He takes the apple from ABU's hand and twirls it in his hand
    hand in JASMINE's hand.)

ALADDIN: So where did you come from?
JASMINE: What does it matter? I run and I am not
        to come back to the table.
ALADDIN: Really? (He bites his apple
        hand pointing to ABU who is known for his cruelty
        look at his face.)
ABU: We say yes!

(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE).

JASMINE: My father is forcing me to marry him.
ALADDIN: It's... horrible. (ABU appears later
        the princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!

(ABU runs upstairs, talking and cursing as he goes).

JASMINE: E dun?
ALADDIN: Abu ko... uh... o ma tilen.
ABU: What is that?
JASMINE: Oh, wa?
ALADDIN: Yes, of course.
JASMINE: Well, does Abu have anything else to say?
ALADDIN: Well, I hope he does something
        autonaka.
ABU: ¡Ay wayna!
JASMINE: Hmm, you gotta say that's cool.

(Until ALADDIN and JASMINE get closer and closer
    ALADDIN leans in for a kiss. However, it is forbidden
    THE GUARDS who found them.)

ANSWER: There you are!
ALADDIN and JASMINE: They got us! (to each other) U
                When does it happen?
JASMINE: Maybe my dad sent them...
ALADDIN: Can you believe me?
JASMINE: E dun?
ALADDIN: Can you believe me? (He raises his hand)
JASMINE: He's a snake. (He takes it).
ALADDIN: Then fly!

(They both jump off the roof, falling and landing in a pile of salt
    try to escape, but the GUARD blocks the exit.)

NOTE: Let’s keep crossing paths, shall we?
        What is it like today?

(ABU fires again at VALTIJAN's turban, but the other guards fire
    here and prevent output . The first RUSH knocks ABU off his head and.
     throw it in the bowl. Three guards capture ALADDIN.)

ANSWER: This is prison for you, kid.
ALADDIN: Hey!
JASMINE: He has to go.
RULER: (Ignoring his princess) Look what we saw
        here , gentlemen , a street scratch. (He throws it away
        ye.)
JASMINE: (gets up and unbuttons her coat) .
        He must go by order of the queen.

(GARDIN suddenly stops and bows, forcing ALADDIN to kneel).

ANSWER: Princess Jasmine.
ALADDIN: ¿Má princesa ye?
ABU: (looking at the vase) Princess?
FAMANA: What are you doing inside the palace? And with that
        aka calle rata?
JASMINE: Not your problem. Just do as I say. Release
        juparu!
RULER: Well, I would, Princess, but my rules depend on that
        Jafar is a great city. Talk to him about it.

(The GUARDS dismiss ALADDIN, who kneels.)

JASMINE: (looking angry) Believe me, I believe it
        with.

(Appearing in the palace, JAFAR secretly leaves his room. He.
    opens the door quietly , but the princess enters immediately
    before concluding. He closes it and takes IAGO inside.
    yes sɔgɔlen.)

JASMINE: Jafar?
JAFAR: Oh, princess.
IAGO: Oh! Jafar, n b'a siri!
JAFAR: How can I help you? (It's his.
        layer, door magnet.)
JASMINE: The guards took a man from the market to you
        rules.
JAFAR: Your father calmly accused me
        Agrabah is in the desert . The boy was a bad person.
JASMINE: What happened?
IAGO: You can't breathe, Jafar!
JAFAR: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.
IAGO: You're just... (JAFAR takes him back inside
        open mouth) - wow, that sucks!
JASMINE: He didn't hug me! I was running and running!
JAFAR: (walking in shock) Oh my God! Oh why
        it’s very painful. I would be a scientist.
JASMINE: What can I do?
JAFAR: By the way, the young man's sentence has already been completed
        I'm sorry.
JASMINE: Any words?
JAFAR: (sighs) Death. (JASMINE smiles).
        With a beating.
JASMINE: No! (He falls to the ground).
JAFAR: I'm sorry, princess.
JASMINE: How do you do it? (She screams and runs out of the room).

(IAGO finally makes it out the door. He runs forward
    Jafar's hand, cough.)

IAGO: How did it go?
JAFAR: I think he carried himself well. (Both a
        the sad smile on their faces.)

(Diss. of JASMINE at night, weeping by the well. RAJAH
    comes to comfort him. She holds it in her.)

JASMINE: It's all my fault, Rajah. I wouldn't know
        made by them.

(Cut to the prison cell. The rats run out and we drop to the front
    ALADDIN is chained to the wall.)

ALADDIN: (to himself) She's a princess. I don't believe in that
        the. Maybe I looked silly to him.
ABU: (jaya) Oh-ho! Aladdi n? Ask everyone!

(There is an ABU in the window above the dungeon).

ALADDIN: Abu! Here! Hey, please help me with this.

(ABU stops, then starts talking wildly, and falls to the ground. He.
     she wraps the hat around her head and stares at him
     imitation of a princess.)

ALADDIN: Hey, he was in trouble. Ah, it’s so good.

(ABU jumps into ALADDIN's arms and pulls out a small tool
    he takes it out of his pocket and releases ALADDIN.)

ABU: Jïsa, jïsa, jïsa.
ALADDIN: Don't worry, Abou. I will never see him again. am
        street rat, remember, and there is a law. Saw
        I must marry the prince who deserves it.

(ABU finally frees ALADDIN's hands).

ABU: Not at all!
ALADDIN: (snaps his fingers) I—I'm a fool
FACT: You're a fool if you let him go, kid.

(We see an old man sitting in the corner who is neither ALADDIN nor ABU
    I have seen this before.)

ALADDIN: Who are you?
WHAT: A humble prisoner like you. But together,
        perhaps more than that.
ALADDIN: I'm listening.
INSIDE: There's a hole, baby. Kabako hill Ok
        with riches beyond your wildest dreams.
        There are plenty of treasures to impress your princess
        veto the action.

(The audience realized that it was the LITTLE MAN who spoke
    "princess" means "prince-CESS" instead of the usual pronunciation
     In the "PRIN cess" field. The MAN HELP turns back and IAGO stays behind
    his head pops out of JAFAR's "adult" mask.)

IAGO: Jafar, can you hurry? I am dying for it!
ALADDIN: But the law says only a king can marry...
INSIDE: You heard the golden rule, right, son?
        Whoever has the gold makes the rules. (Laughs,
        terrible sight of the door.)
ALADDIN: Then why do you want these strange things for me?
        wealth with me?
KANPA: I want a guy with strong legs and power
        I'll come back to that later.
ALADDIN: Ah, trouble. You're outside, are we here?

(He walks towards the wall looking for a hidden exit).

EYES: Mmm, mmm, mmm. Things aren't as simple as they seem.
        seem So we got a deal?

(ALADDIN turns to ABU, who raises his hand).

ABU: Oh, um.

(Cut to the forest. We see ALADDIN leading the horse
    There are minorities and ABU. Insult. In the group of surprises.)

DUNK: Who disturbs my sleep?
ALADDIN: I'm sorry, Aladdin.
HEART: Let's move on. Do not touch anything but the lamp.

(The pit opens with a loud crash and stairs appear in front of it
    His name is ALADDIN. )

THIS IS: Remember, son, bring me the lantern first, and then
        you got your reward.
ALADDIN: And, Abu. (Hiding ABU under hand
        with his jacket.)

(ALADDIN starts down the stairs. He reaches the floor
    He entered a golden room full of treasures.)

ALADDIN: We will do what will happen!
RESULTS: Alas!
ALADDIN: Just a few of those things can make me rich
        like a sultan!

(The ABU watches, sees the property, and then drives away).

ALADDIN: ¡Abu!

(ABU stops in the middle and falls on the carpet below).

ALADDIN: Don't touch anything! We need to find a lamp.

(They start walking across the room as the carpet rises
    from the ground and begin to follow them. ABU is memory
    they suffer.)

ABU: Sisan wa?

(He turns around and sees MATTO lying on the floor. He continues to.
    MATO starts chasing again. Once again ABU returned though
     Move ALFORMA and hit the treasure hill. IT MUST BE EXECUTED
     He runs towards ALADDIN, pulling down his pants leg.)

ABU: Aladdin is good! Aladdin is great!
ALADDIN: Abu, can you stop him?

(MAT follows again, but this time with ABU mounting MAT
    jumping to the other side. He comes down with a pomp and throws it
    ABU is interesting. If ABU jumps, MATO goes back to the other side
     so. This time ABU got down to karate. ALFORMA can be obtained
    opens and removes ABU's hat and then puts it on himself. ABU is installed
    he thought for a moment , until MATO pointed to an acorn in front of him
     face. Both ABU and CARPET jump in fear and run. The ABU carried out attacks
     Then ALADDIN turns his head to look at ALFORMA.)

ALADDIN: Abu, what are you... crazy?

(Behind the treasure pile is a carpet).

ALADDIN: The magic carpet! Date. Get out of here. I'm going to go
        it hurts your heart too.

(Mato emerges slowly, nervously, taking ABU's hat and ashes
    it is closed. He runs to ALADDIN, handing his hat to ABU at his side.
     he. (ABU screams and jumps into ALADDIN's arms).

ALADDIN: Calm down, Abu. He doesn't want to bite.

(MATO takes ABU's hat again and gives it to him. ABU trembles
    there are fingers and screams. MATTO starts to walk away, "unfortunately.")

ALADDIN: Hey, wait a minute. Don’t go to the gym. Maybe you can help
        And. (ALFORMA looks back with a smile. Then she runs off
        and around the couple.) Hey, huh! YOU
        trying to find this lamp. (RUG
        signals for them to follow him.) I think he knows that
        wherever he is.

(They go into a cave until they are big enough
    an underground cavern. In the middle of the room is a large pillar,
     the stairs leading to it. Water surrounds him
     evenly placed stones form a bridge. Be
    the pillar is bright light. ALADDIN begins to cut the bridge.)

ALADDIN: Wait for it!
ABU: You are. Or did he see her ?

(ABU is a temple with a golden monkey. The long legs are a.
    a large ruby. ABU was drawn hypnotically. ALADDIN turns around
     the stairs move fast. CARPET saw ABU and grabbed his back in a futile effort
     catch. ALADDIN finally gets the TAG LAMP.)

ALADDIN: Is that true? We have arrived at the right place
        here... (He looks down to see ABU free himself
        BEFORE you take off the rug and run to the jewelry.) Abu-
        DO IT!

(ABU grabs the jewelry. There is a bang and the room starts to collapse).
    thalsuña.)

HEARTBREAK: Infidels!
RESULTS: Alas!
PUICHAWIN'S COMMENT: You touched the forbidden treasure. (THAT'S IT
               to set a stone, but a stone
                and the temple turned to lava.) Now e
                never see the light of day again!

(ALADDIN runs down the stairs, but they are tied to a railing, and he.
    it descends towards the sky until it floats in the air. The waters had changed
     wash. He pulls towards her when suddenly the CAPTAIN appears
    to hold it. ABU is standing on a cliff
    bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks melting into lava.
    Then ALFORNA rushes in, and ALADDIN catches her, as he grabs the last stone
     resistant.)

ALADDIN: Wow! Mats, let's go!

(They run together through ditches avoiding fences and grass.
    trash. (ABU holds ALADDIN's head and rubs his eyes).

ALADDIN: Abu, now is not the time for fear! (Also from ABU
        head to run into the wall.)
        You start to panic.

(ALFORMA enters an iceberg through another hole. Eventually they.
    out through the outside door. Outside, the pit begins
     he sighs and closes the door. MATO and the company are already on top with a
    the stone falls on the snow and sends it to the ground. ALADDIN caught it
    stone wall and hold. He sees the old man from above,
    amparapankiwa.)

ALADDIN: Help!
NOW: Throw me a flashlight!
ALADDIN: I can't stand it. Give me your hand.
NOW: Give me your lamp first!

(ALADDIN reaches out and takes out the TOWN LAMP. He grabs it, a
    THE LITTLE MAN raises it above his head.)

YOUNG MAN: Ha ha ha ha! Than! finally! Ha ha ha ha!

(ALADDIN leaves with ABU's help. But SANI
     MAN pushes ABU away and grabs ALADDIN by the wrist.)

ALADDIN: What are you doing?
HERE: I will give you your reward. (JAFAR turns to him
        normal voice.) Give you eternal reward.

(He pulls out a coiled dagger, almost stabbing ALADDIN, when.
    ABU bit his finger. It screams but ALADDIN,
     he is thrown into a cave. The little man throws ABU into the hole at the same time
     OK. They believe in them. CARPET can see it though below
     rock. He tries to escape, and he escapes. It’s a race
     to capture ALADDIN , but hit the wall several times
    times and without their knowledge. Above, the pit roars
    the last time it falls flat again. JAFAR is the best
     in masks.)

JAFAR: Hey hey hey! That's what I have. It’s all mine! I (it's not
        found in his pocket) --- where? Don't be afraid!!

(The kiss disappears into JASMINE's room. She sits by her bed
    RAJAH looking sad. of the SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Jasmina? Oh dear brother. What is the wrong thing?
JASMINE: Jafar... did... something... horrible. (THE
        She seems to be crying.)
SULTAN: Yeah, there, there my son, we're writing things.
        Now tell me everything.

(Cut to the bottom of the valley. ALADDIN lies unconscious on the GUSUN.
    (ABU tries to wake him up).

ABU: Oh, oh. Is it Aladdin? Develop. Aladdin is a brother.

(TAPIT gets up and picks up ALADDIN. He gets up slowly).

ALADDIN: Oh my head. (Looking at the locked entrance).
        They were arrested. (In anger, he crosses his arms towards her

        we've got "Al?" » Or maybe "Where?" "Or whatever."
        a "Laddi?" » (GENIE disappears, then dog
        wrapped in plaid jumps in.) He's like: “Here boy!
        Come on, Laddi!
ALADDIN: (shakes his head) I've hit my head and continued.
        I thought I was going to.
GENIE: (Still flying) Do you smoke? Would you mind if I did? (Dog
        blow out the smoke and then return to GENI . IT MUST BE EXECUTED
        screams wildly.) Oh yafa Cheetah, n jigi b'a kan
        I didn’t smoke sticky! Hello Rugman! I didn't see that
        you guys in a few thousand years! Give me that pompom! Hey!
        Than! (MATTO runs up and greets NERO.
        GENIUS turns to ALADDIN.) Suppose you are short
        as the ultimate master. (He raises his beer belly.) Or
        Either that or I was raised. look at me
        aside, am I different from you?
ALADDIN: Wait a minute! I am... your mistress?
GENIUS: (He places the diploma in ALADDIN's hands and a
        mortar head.) That’s right! he can do that
        teach us!! What do you want from me, (like Arnold
        Schwarzenegger) is always impressive, (in it
        bucket) distant contents (such as ventriloquist
        dummy) reads repeatedly, (pushes dummy aside) .
        but they never copied…

(More than a lot of GENE surrounding it).

The DUP slowly . GENIUS: duplicate, duplicate, duplicate.
            duplicate duplicate duplicate ye
            duplicates, duplicates, tab-tab .
GENIUS: (Speaking like a ring announcer in boxing).
        Intelligent! Of! A lighthouse! (Enter Ed
        Sullivan) Here, right out of the lamp, of course
        here for your great pleasure, to fulfill your desires.
        Thank you uuuu!
ALADDIN: Wow! Do you want to be fulfilled?
GENIUS: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-not
        seeking more desire. (Turns into a lunge
        enters the plane, the ball lands and three GENIUS emerge
        windows.) Well, three. (THree GENIUSES
        the knights appeared.) Uno, dos, tres.
        (Changing Groucho Marx into black and white.) Nope
        change, exchange or return . (Duck
        comes the mystery word "return".
ALADDIN: (to ABU) Now I know I dreamed.
GENIE: (Music from "Friend Like Me" begins) Master, I don't know
        I think you understand what we're getting at here! SO
        why not ruminate when I shine
        convenient. (GENIE is a.
        incandescent lamp).

    Well, Ali Baba had forty thieves
    Scheherazade had a thousand stories
    But use your talent, because you've got your work cut out for you
    You have a magic that never fails!

(GENIE has 40 thieves surround ALADDIN with swords.
    GENIUS appeared in his jacket, and raised his hand to punch him
    to show the thieves.)

    Now you have power in your corner
    There is some great ammo in your camp
    You punch, spice, yahoo and whatever
    You see, all you have to do is turn off this lamp
    And I said, 'I'll tell.'

(The boxing ring appears, in ALADD's corner, in the massage room.
    written by GENIUS. And the GENIE turned into a mountain of fire and.
    yell. Then the GENIUS appeared under the lamp and grabbed ALADDIN's lamp.
     touch the lamp with the handle.)

    Nanny Aladdin, the ladonbaga
    What is your happiness?
    I would like to take your order, please write
    You've never had a friend like me
    No, no, no, no!

(GENIE sets up tables and chairs to record things a
    notepad is a tool . )

    Life is your kitchen
    And I am your master!
    Come and ask what you want
    You've never had a friend like me.

(GENIE comes out like a meat dish, and goes back to normal,
    but he raises his ears and listens to ALADDIN. Finally, it explodes
     two in four GENIEs.)

    Yes sir we take pride in our work
    You are the head, the king, the shah!
    What you want to say is yours! The real food
    How much baklava?

(GENITOS gets a haircut, a haircut, and a haircut, followed by ALADDIN
    appears in a comfortable chair (eh?) surrounded by treasures
    and happiness with women. GENIUS showed up full
    ka baklava di.)

    Look at a short "A" column.
    Test the entire "B" group.
    I want to help you man
    You've never had a friend like me

(ALADDIN standing on the dinner column with a large A on top,
    go to the second column with B at the top. It’s going to fall
    with a breastplate held by GENIE. He opens his mouth, .
    the mouth is arched. Miniature GENIUS
     dressed as a wizard.)

(Mini GENIE doing a little dance with two adult GENIEs
    a ball. Eventually they round up the mini GENIUS and crush
    which is nowhere to be found.)

    Can your friends do that?
    Do your friends do that?
    Would your friends pull this off in a tiny outfit?
    Your friends can go crazy!
    Well, here it is
    Can your friends go to Abracadabra, let them rip
    And then losing this crap?

(NERO nods, copies, then juggles.
    He throws it at ALADDIN, who juggles him with one arm around him
    one end is like a basket with a finger. He threw it away
     goes back to GENI , who tries to fight back
     itself from the edge of the cloth. It’s brown, pink and pink
     until it becomes a small white powder. The rabbit changes.
    purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment at EPCOT Center).
     The dragon breathes fire into the HAREM Three girls,
    who dance around ALADDIN. When he began to take them seriously, .
     U tununna.)

    So don’t just sit there, snoring, empty
    I am here to answer every midday prayer
    You got it kindly, proof
    Are you a strategic thinker? matter!
    I would love to help you
    So I really want to know what you want
    You definitely have a wish three miles away
    So just scratch it, and oh!


(The GENIE and ALADDIN are similar and changed
    witness who knows and surrounds ALADDIN. GENIUS trembles
     list {writing in Arabic} ALADDIN's earrings, which he wears
    pat your elbow dry after washing.)

    Mr. Aladdin, sir, I want two or three
    I'm hiring, big mogul
    You never, ever have a friend
    You never, ever have a friend
    You've never... been... friends... with... me!
    You've never had a friend like me!

(HAREM The dancing girls reappear, and ALADDIN leans down to kiss one of them.
     He turns into a GENIUS who relocates four lion dancers
    life. On the other hand, he passes four dancing camels,
     and later a great dance number follows . ABU brought a lot of gold
     in his power, but GENIUS gathers everything into a storm and.
    hold it until you are all back in the cave. GENIUS is a
    a neon "APPLAUSE" sign in the background. ABU put on his hat and.
    feels empty.)

GENIE: What will happen, Sir?
ALADDIN: You give me three wishes?
GENIE: (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost. Exist
        some reservations , some caveats
ALADDIN: How is it?
GENIE: Ah, first rule: You can't kill anyone. (THE
        cuts off his head with his hand.) So don't do that
        ask. Rule number two: I cannot make anyone fall in love
        with another person. (The head becomes a large hat
        lips kissing ALADDIN.) Punish you a little, there.
        (He sleeps naked, then gets up to change
        zombie.) Rule Three: You can't bring people back from here
        off. Not a pretty picture, (He holds it

SULTAN: Jafar, this is boring. If it weren’t for that
        many years of good and faithful service... . From now on,
        speak to me to judge the prisoners.
        before they were beheaded.
JAFAR: I assure you, Your Majesty, this will not happen again.
SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, let's mess this up now
        business is behind us. Please?
JAFAR: I apologize
        well done, princess. (She kisses his hand, but...
        he cut it to pieces.)
JASMINE: If I must, something good will come
        so. If I am a queen, I will
        it’s hard to get rid of you.
SULTAN: That’s good. So everything came together. Now Jasmine, .
        returned to this conjugal relation, (a
        he looks up to see Jasmine coming out) Jasmine?
        Jasmine is doing well! (He runs after her).
JAFAR: I wish I had that flashlight!
IAGO: (As Jasmine) I'm strong enough to run
        YOU! I see! Mind you - we keep kissing
        until this fool, and his folly for his daughter
        the rest of our lives…
JAFAR: No, Iago. Just find an idiot guy.
        Then they'll throw us out... or behead us!
MOLEMAT: ¡Eeewww!
IAGO: (thinking) Oh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
        Is that Jafar? What if you were a naughty guy?
JAFAR: (Looking down at IAGO) What?
IAGO: Well, you're going to marry a princess, all right? Just, uh, .
        you will become a sultan!
JAFAR: Oh! To marry a mosquito? I will be the Sultan. The idea is this
        what a sweet sight!
IAGO: Yes, that's enough! Than! And then we pulled the father and.
        the little woman on the mountain! (That’s a bag of bombs
        bottom) Kersplat!
JAFAR: Iago, I love how your dirty little mind works!

(They both laugh as we walk to an oasis in the desert where MATO is
    reached the ground.)

GENIE: (Still a flight attendant) Thank you for choosing Magic
        Carpets for all your travel needs. Don’t get upset
        until the belt stops completely. (As
        ALADDIN and ABU descend the ladder they built
        ENGLISH) Thank you. Good bye! THANK YOU!
        Bye! (Returns to normal) Come on. What you're saying
        Is that a winner, are you waiting for Mustafa?
ALADDIN: Oh, you showed me that right. Now for my three wishes - .
GENIUS: Are my ears deceiving me? Three? You want to get down
        ¡Wawa!
ALADDIN: Ah, no, I never really wanted to go
        dump. You are the only one who has done that.

(GENIE thinks for a moment, then her grin slows. She stands up
    sagasogo.)

GENIE: Well, wasn't I bound? You've done it right
        baaaaad baby but no more gifts.
ALADDIN: A fair plan. Three wishes, by the way. I wish they were
        OK. (GENIUS) What do you want to do?

(GENIE hangs like a hammock between two trees).

GENIE: Is it me? Nobody's ever asked me that before. Come on, let’s get inside
        Nayan kasojaha, ah, Armasim.
ALADDIN: Why? Don’t tell me that.
GENIUS: Freedom .
ALADDIN: Are you a prisoner?
GENIUS: Everything is part and parcel, every concert of genius.
        (Serious, voice ringing) Phenomenal cosmic
        thanks! (Decreases, decreases in MAGIC LAMP.)
        A very small community
ALADDIN: Genius, that's awful.
GENIE: (From the lamp) But oh... to be free. No
        Ne b i ko "Poof! I b mun f? Poof! I b mun f?"
        Poof you like it! What do you want?" he asked. For my own good
        sir, that would be the greatest thing
        All the magic and treasure in the world! But
        what am I talking about here? Let’s be honest
        here. THAT IS NOT IT. Genius, to rise to.
        i smell like hummus
ALADDIN: Why not?
NERO: Let's just get through it, Dad
        I want to get out. So you can imagine how often that happens
        pudding (pudding) ye.
ALADDIN: I'm sorry. I will save you.
GENIUS: (His head becomes Pinocchio's with a frown) Hmm
        Well that’s true. Yell!
ALADDIN: Not really, I promise. (He rubs his nose
        and GENIE's consciousness returns to normal.) After I did mine
        I will explain to you my first two wishes and my third
        free. (He raises his hand)
GENIE: Well, I hope so. (Takes ALADDIN'S hand).
        OK Let’s do some magic! (Changes have been made
        magician.) If. what do you want
        most of them are more?
ALADDIN: Come on, I'm in your arms...
GENIUS: Ehhh! (Like a candle, and the GENIUS chest is a
        with a heart cross in it.) Of course! I want to be able to
        to make someone fall in love, remember?
ALADDIN: Oh, but Genie. She’s smart and funny and.
GENIUS: Beautiful?
ALADDIN: Very interesting. He has these pages that are... and
        hair, wow…and her smile.
GENIUS: (I'm sitting in a cafe in Paris with ABU and MATO.)
        Am I. It is pleasant.
ALADDIN: But she's a princess. For me to have a chance
        I was like... Hey, can you make me king?
GENIE: Look here. (There's a "King's Cookbook.") Um,
        The king's meat? (There is a bird a
        crown head) No, Alaskan king crab?
        (He snaps his fingers, and we see SEBASTIAN crab
        "The Mermaid" is attached.) Ouch, me
        I hate it when they do that. Caesar's salad? (A
        (Truth comes out and tries to stab him.) And you, .
        Bully? Ah, making a king. (He looks like a liar
        ALADDIN.) Now, is this official intention? You have to say that
        arti !
ALADDIN: Genie, I want to make you king!
GENIE: Very interesting! ¡That’s a huge thing! (Take a square
        hands and like Arsenio Hall. and jute
        tailor/fashion designer.) Sani in Fez
        The bodice combo is still in the third century. These
        patterns - what do we mean - prayer? No!
        Let's work with me here. (Takes ALADDIN
        measuring, grinding and taking ALADDIN
        dressed in royal robes.) I like it, muy
        macho ! Now I want something else. What does it do
        Appointment? It’s about transportation. Excuse me
        and, monkey ! So, here! (ABU looks at it
        she covers herself with ALFORMA but is stolen by GENIE and
        he runs away.)
RESULTS: Alas!
GENIE: Here he comes, (played by ALADDIN and GENIE
        exhibition scene where ALADDIN stands on the podium
        in "AL".) And what better way to do it yourself
        The main entrance to the streets of Agrabah
        Get yourself a new camel! Hear,
        it’s a science! (A GENIUS head door
        open the door where ABU becomes a camel. THE
        spit from the side of the mouth, as a signal. But
        GENIE doesn't know.) Mmm, not necessarily. (It’s his own
        hands and ABU form a beautiful white horse.)
        It’s very difficult. Wait and see. What do you have to do?
        (NERO crosses his arms several times and backs away
        ABU in: bird, fly, turtle '57
        Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1". (It's here
        I don't think I know cars, but judging from the heart
        flippers, said nuff.) A pound is in my pocket
        normal.) Snake!! Esalalumbo, Shimin Dumbo, and others! Wow!!
        (And since the main character is Dumbo, the ABU changes
        like a lion. ALFORNA is struggling to survive
        under ABU size 46 feet.) Discuss the frame
        goodbye, watch this act!

(ABU sees the light in the pool and jumps into a tree.
     The wood is normally bent to the ground where ABU
     she wraps it up and looks up at ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Abu, you are very sweet.
GENIUS: He's dressed up, he's a monster, though
        we are not ready yet. Grab your towel, .
        boy, because we make you a star!

(We're slowly sinking into the oasis in the distance, like fireworks
    begins to burst outward. players beat the CU stack .
    (Look for the BEESTS here.) We turn to see the SULTAN
    balance them out. It balances nicely at the end of the line, .
     He sat up and sighed. However, the JAFAR barges and.
    pilax t'unjasi.)

JAFAR: Sir, I have found a solution to this problem
        phuchamaxa (fuchamaxa) ye.
IAGO: Oh! There is a problem with your daughter!
SULTAN: Oh, really?
JAFAR: (open his mouth) Here. “She’s a princess
        did not choose a husband at the appointed time, .
        which the sultan elects himself.
SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all suitors! (He tries to
        placing a cookie in IAGO's mouth. IAGO is supported
        away. SULTAN pulls out some cookies from his mind
        back.) How can I choose someone who hates it?
        (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly a
        makeup on your lips.)
JAFAR: Don't worry, sir. There is something more. When the in
        the issue of not having a suitable king, a princess
        if you get married... hmm... interesting.
SULTAN: Are we there? JOHN?
JAFAR: Visor King! Well, that would be… for me!
SULTAN: Well, I thought law could only be made by one king
        to marry a princess, I know.
JAFAR: Critical times require strategic planning
        Mr. (He pulls out a stick and hypnotizes her
        SULTAN with him.)
SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...
JAFAR: You ordered the princess to marry me.
SULTAN: I…… command… princess…… (spell
        breaks in no time)…but you are too old!
JAFAR: (bringing the stick closer to him) The princess is getting married
        NAYA!
SULTAN: The princess is married... (fate again
        karilen, nin sen in na, “Prince
        Ali".) What? What is that? This song! Ha ha ha.
        Jafar, you have to come and see this!

(We watch the parade process, because it looks like GENIUS
    the human form is a great example.)

STORIES: Tell Prince Ali!
NEW: Hello! That’s Prince Ali!
BIG: Hey, clear the way at the old bazaar,
    Hey you, come on, she's a shining new star,
    Come see it for the first time in your area!
    Make your way, here it is, .
    Playing battles, playing drums.
    You will love this guy

    Try not to worry too much now
    Preview your salami on Sunday
    And come to meet their awesome fleet.

(IAGO dances to the music as JAFAR looks on
    Large "carts" carried six passengers in the trunk of the ABU. They are standing still
    on each other’s shoulders with ALI shaking hands.)

    Prince Ali, great, Ali Ababwa!
    He's as strong as ten ordinary people, actually
    He ran into a lot of people
    A hundred crimes with swords
    Who sent these fools to their masters, why Prince Ali!

(In ALI, the battery fails, but the GENIE(tm) indicator lights up
    crushes the stack and ends up catching them all in one acrobatic move
     carriage manufacture. NERO turns into an old man and a young boy
    and the last two paragraphs to the audience.)

MAN COURSE: (Takes the camels) He has seventy-five golden camels!

(Pops here is a typical parade commentator)

HARRY: Aren't they cute, June?

WOMAN'S VOICE: (on float) Purple peacock, fifty-three!

(Another technician is coming).

JUNE: Big Harry, I love dogs!

GENIE: (GENIE appears on screen, a huge balloon of gore drops
            parade) and so on.
    In the case of animals in other animals
    Does he have a zoo, I'll tell you
    This is a world class zoo!

(GENIE comes out like a rabbit, then like a goat, and says the last two words
    lines for two children from the past. We go to the balcony, .
    where three HAREM Girls are joined by a HAREM GENIE.)

    NERO: 1.1.
        NPOGOTIGI: (yɔrɔ kɛrɛfɛ) .
    Prince Ali, his boyfriend, Ali Ababwa
        There is no doubt that Ali is handsome
    This physics, the pronunciation
        It’s never ordinary, it’s never boring
    Goodbye
        Everything about this guy is fascinating
    Well, come over here
        He’s amazing, he’s smart, he’s wonderful
    Adjust your sails and get ready
        It broke my heart
    Falcon, crawl to watch over Prince Ali!
        And I love her outfit!

(JASMINE looks out from the palace balcony. A.
    he goes, and then he goes.)

CHORUS: He has ninety-five white Persian monkeys!
    (Monkeys want it, see Monkeys!)
    And it costs nothing to maintain them!
    (He’s generous, by the way)
    He has slaves, slaves and helpers!
    (It’s an honor to serve him)
    They bow to his whims and want to serve him
    They are just dogs about their loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali it is!

(ALADDIN throws gold coins at the crowd who hurry toward him
    Take them away. ABU to parade up the steps
    palace and interior. THE SULTAN runs to the door
    towards the throne room, but JAFAR is standing in front of the door.
    It was suddenly opened under the leadership of ABU and very much
     JAFAR and IAGO are behind the door.)

GENIUS: Prince Ali !
    With love for it! Ali Dogs
    I hear your princess is a lovely sight!
    And so, folks,
    He got dressed and left
    Sixty elephants, llamas galore
    Oso b'a la, lionai
    The marching band
    With forty fakirs, a cook and a baker
    Their stomachs screaming on one side
    Make way for Prince Ali!

(Very little until ALADDIN runs on ABU's back.
    run to the MAGIC CRPET mat and towards the SULTAN. JAFAR is convicted
     the door is closed.)

SULTAN: (applause) It’s amazing, really nice.
ALADDIN: (draws a deep voice.) Ahem. Your Lord, I am
            I have come from afar to seek your daughter's hand.
SULTAN: Prince Ali's Dogs! Very. I'm satisfied with it
        to meet with you. (She runs over and grabs ALI's hand).
        This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He was happy to be there
        Give
JAFAR: (Very dry) Ecstatic. I was afraid, king
        Aboubou-- and so on.
ALADDIN: --A few!
JAFAR: That's nothing. I can’t push this without asking
        and I'm waiting...
SULTAN: ...Allah, this is truly a miraculous device.
        (She throws pom poms, and they are hers
        mustache.) I think I.
ALADDIN: Of course, your majesty. I can.

(He helps SULTAN to MAT and he falls.
    JAFAR pins MAT down with a cane.)

JAFAR: Sir, I advise you not to.
SULTANI: -- I ye butɔni digi, Jafar. A dege ka ɲɛnajɛ dɔ kɛ.

        does he think she is fit for a princess?
ALADDIN: Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He gives the injection
        JAFAR's goatee is raised in all directions
        instructions.) Let him talk to me. I am winning
        ¡phuchama!
JASMINE: How dare you! (Everyone looks shocked).
        Have you all decided on the future? I
        I won't get an answer! (He runs out).
SULTANI: Oh my Goddess. Don’t worry, Prince Ali. You just have to give it
        It was time for Jasmine to get comfortable. (They left).
JAFAR: I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince
        Aboubou and others .

(Ask JASMINE on her porch at night. We found her on our knees
    ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)

ALADDIN: What should I do? Jasmine didn't miss me either
        i should have known that talking to him wasn't controversial
        at the will of the foolish ruler. (ABU is struggling
        wolf legs to banana mouth. He's shaking it
        and a banana exploded in his eyes. Then he did
        discard banana peel
        take.)
GENIE: (on carpet, playing chess) So! (MATTO does the same,
        throwing the black line off the board.) Hello.
        That’s a good idea. (as Rodney Dangerfield) I
        I can't believe I'm losing all-in.
ALADDIN: Genius, I need help.
GENIUS: (as Jack Nicholson) Well, Sparky, here we are
        decision. If you want to piss off a younger woman, you have to do it
        Righteous warrior, can you follow me?
ALADDIN: Where are we?
GENIE: (Reverts to normal, holding grenade launcher. Points at him
        write his words on the board) Tell him
        please get out!!!
ALADDIN: That's not it! If only Jasmine knew who I really was
        dirty street dog, laughing at me. (THE
        she wears a dress, which shines like a GENIUS.)
GENIUS: A woman appreciates a man who makes her happy!
        (ALADDIN removes the chain and turns on the lights.
        GENIUS comes out with a real turban.) Al, everyone
        joking aside, you really have to control yourself.
ALADDIN: Hey, that's the last thing. Light,
        I'm going to see him. I am sweet, I am cool, .
        sure. How are you doing?
GENIE: (Sadly) Like a king.

(ALADDIN runs to the balcony WITH THE SHEEP. JASMINE is on the bed,
    view. RAJAH is on his side.)

ALADDIN: (Jan wali jaya) ¿Princesa Jasmine?

(RAJAH looks up and sighs).

JASMINE: Is anyone there?
ALADDIN: Hello, Prince Ali. Ahem--(She jumped into her own
        on the inside) King Ali Ababwa.
JASMINE: I don't want to see you.
ALADDIN: No, no, please, princess. Give me a chance. (RAJAH is a man
        he sighed and walked over.)
JAFAR: A' ye n to yen.
ALADDIN: I'm sorry!

(On the other side of the balcony is ALFORMA below and GENIE below).

GENIE: How about our friend?

(ALFORMA crosses her throat with her hand).

ALADDIN: Good cat, take it. The kid down to the bottom . (He goes away
        his veil to drive away the RAJAH.)
JASMINE: (She looks at him thinking she sees him)
        first.) Wait, wait. Do I know you guys?
ALADDIN: (changes quickly) No, no.
JASMINE: You remind me of the guy I met at the market.
ALADDIN: The market? (A bee makes a noise in his head).
        I have employees who market for me.
        Why do I have employees who go to market?
        to my servants, therefore I cannot find you.

        you have to choose yourself. (JASMINE and RAJAH look at them
        look at each other in confusion.) I'm leaving now. (THE
        then go up the hill and down.)
JASMINE: No!
ALADDIN: (shakes his head) What? What?
JASMINE: (Surprised) How -- how do you do that?
        (He looks up to see an ALFORMA).
ALADDIN: The flying carpet.
JASMINE: That’s great. (ALFORMA takes JASMINE's hand a
        glans.)
ALADDIN: You, uh, you don't want to take one, do you?
        We can see the world from the palace.
JASMINE: Isn't it dangerous?
ALADDIN: Of course. Can you trust me?
JASMINE: (As she says all this...
        line value) What?
ALADDIN: (Raising his hand as before) You can trust me
        NAYA?
JASMINE: (smiles) Yeah.

(He takes her hand and climbs the SHELTER. He zooms up,
    putting them both on their seats. Music "One Everything".
     A new world" blew up. JASMINE looked back and saw RAJAH watching her
    he looked at her curiously. He smiles as they run over the palace
     on the wall and in the sky.)

ALADDIN: I can show you the world
    Brillant, brillant, belebeleba.
    Princess, tell me the last time you visited
    Should your heart decide?

(ALFORMA zooms through the city, pausing a
    flower. He gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE.
      It’s funny.)

    I can open my eyes
    You will be amazed at the miracle
    Top, side and bottom
    On a running carpet


(ALFORMA acts like ALADDIN singing before the clouds grow).

    The new world!
    A whole new look
    Nobody says no to me
    Or wherever you go
    Or think you're dreaming

(SMILE He looks back and Agrabah disappears from view. WORM
    run into the clouds and out of the clouds.)

JASMINE: A new era
    That is the most glaring truth I have ever known
    But when you are up there
    It’s very clear
    I am in a new world with you now!

ALADDIN: I'm in a new world with you now!

(They both encounter a small cloud as ALFORMA continues to fly. She.
    clouds surround the image so that it forms a circle.)

JASMINE: amazing pictures
    An indescribable feeling
    Hovering, spinning, roaming free
    Amidst the endless diamond sky

(They join a flock of birds in the sky. One looks terrifying.
    and screaming. MATTO jumps, sometimes falls
    ALADDIN and JASMINE are in free fall, but are caught. They
    honor above the clouds, where the starry night awaits.)

JASMINE: A whole new world!
ALADDIN: Don't you dare open your eyes
JASMINE: There are a hundred thousand different things to see
ALADDIN: Hold your breath, it'll be all right!
JASMINE: I feel like a shooting star,
    I have come this far
    I can’t go back to where I was!

(They are running over a river, like the Nile, because they are running behind it
     the cells of the ship are a large pyramid. They greet the employee
     covering the entire surface of the screw. But, it’s funny
    too much to scratch and crack the nose.)

ALADDIN: A new world!
JASMINE: The whole tour is amazing
ALADDIN: A new horizon must follow
JASMINE: There minute, red words

(They run towards the fleeing wild animals. JASMINE waves at one of them).

BOTH: I follow them somewhere
    There is time to waste
    Let me share this whole new world with you

    A new era
    This is where we will be

(They go to Greece, ALADDIN buys it there pple buys it there
    in the tree waving his hand towards the now safe JASMINE
    it translates to ALADDIN, not to Prince ALI.)

ALADDIN: That's funny
JASMINE: Great place
PANI: Me and you!

(A CARPET floats on the river, and we see a light
    the moon is in the middle of the ocean. Fireworks exploded and we saw a couple
    During Chinese New Year celebrations, sitting on the roof.)

JASMINE: It’s so weird.
ALADDIN: Yes.
JASMINE: (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble)
        Too bad Abu has to miss this one.
ALADDIN: No, he hates fireworks. (TAPIT raises his head
        he understands what's going on.) Of course he doesn't
        running around. (And now ALADDIN understands)
        Yes... oh no!
JASMINE: (removes her hat) You're a boy
        walk! I know that's it. Why did you lie to me?
ALADDIN: Jasmine, n b'a fò.
JASMINE: You thought I was stupid?
ALADDIN: Yes!
JASMINE: I think, ot?
ALADDIN: No, I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't. It is not so
        what I meant to say.
JASMIN: Who are you? Tell the truth!
ALADDIN: Really? (Looking at GUSURU, who has made a gesture,
        give up all hope.) Really…really…it’s me
        sometimes wearing plain clothes to escape
        the hardships of palace life. (MATTO PRODUCTION
        defeat.) But of course I am king! (Pen on and down
         his veil pulled it over his eyes.)
JASMINE: Why didn't you see ofn?
ALADDIN: Well, you know, uh... the king is going
        a city that hides itself, looks like a miracle, .
        don't you believe it?
JASMINE: It doesn’t.

(He takes a cocoon and rubs it against him. EXERCISE a
    the pom pom is under the "chin" and represents a secret. Outside darkening.
    from the palace balcony where ALADDIN and JASMINE return. RUG
    a ladder appears and descends. Then ALADDIN came down
     right under the balcony.)

JASMINE: Good night, beautiful prince.
ALADDIN: Sleep well, princess.

(They slowly lean forward for a kiss, but MATO collides with him with them
    kiss her earlier than she expected. It goes slowly, then turns to.
    Check it out, guys. Finally, he enters the room through the curtain.)

ALADDIN: Yes! (Referring back to ALFORMA, below
        downstairs.) For the first time in my life
        things are starting to look good.

(Four pairs of arms hug Jasmine's porch).

ALADDIN: Good morning! What? (A dapper hanging from his mouth.
        Muffled voice) Abu! Abu! (We see a lion
        attached to a hook hanging from a tree.)
NOTE: Hold your breath!

(With chains on his legs and arms. Another EXAMPLE
    ALFORMA is wrapped around the tree.)

JAFAR: I'm afraid you're welcome, Prince
        Aboubou and others . (He goes away.) There he is
        was never found.

(He kicks a GUARD in the head and knocks him unconscious. Cut to him
    on the cliff where the SARIES laugh as ALADDIN'S body sinks into the water.
      He remembers it now, but his foot is stuck in a rock. Rock
     strikes the bottom of the river , the qunt'asis turban descends and the lamp falls
    from the cut juk' rise. He sees it and tries to light the lamp. However, it's a juke
    he loses consciousness and falls to the ground. Lamp, which is not stable and helps little
    he moves his hands and rubs it as he moves. It shakes, and jumps.
    and GENIUS appears with a bath brush, rubber duck and shower cap).

ƝƐNABƆLI: Never fail . I'm in the bath and it's friction
        a lampshade. (duck quack) Hi. (see a) is called

JASMINE: I'll never marry you. (Goes to SULTAN)
        Dad, I chose Prince Ali!
JAFAR: There is no Prince Ali!

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in front of the balcony door).

ALADDIN: Better read your crystal again, Jafar!
JASMINE: Prince Ali ye!

(JAFAR smiles at ALADDIN).

IAGO: How the hell... (back to the parrot)... uh, awk!
ALADDIN: Tell them the truth, Jafar! You tried to find me
        will beg.
JAFAR: What is that? (Going to the SULTAN) LIGHTNING
        This is absurd, Your Majesty. He is obviously lying.
        (He brings the stick close to the SULTAN's face.)
SULTAN: He seems... lying.

(ALADDIN sees the wand with glittering eyes).

JASMINE: Dad, what's wrong with you?
ALADDIN: ¡Nayajj yattwa!

(ALADDIN grabs the stick and sticks it to the ground. JAFAR jumps.
    and the spell was permanently destroyed.)

SULTAN: ¡Ay, ay, ay, ¡Diosaja!
ALADDIN: I'm sorry, Jafar didn't know
        This! (Brings stick forward) .
SULTAN: Why? Is that Jafar? You are a traitor!

(Three people lead JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Your Majesty, all this can be explained.
SULTAN: ¡Guardanaka! ¡Guardanaka!
IAGO: Well, that's all, we're dead, forget it. Each
        dig a grave for both of us. They were already dead.

(But JAFAR sees the flashlight in ALADDIN’s pocket. He turns, but.
    garadiw katjapjja.)

SULTAN: Arrest Jafar immediately.
JAFAR: Not yet, baby!

(JAFAR pulls out a bottle from his pocket. ALADDIN sees it and hurries away
    he, but JAFAR threw the bottle on the floor. A thick red cloud
    will be published. If he goes, so does JAFAR.)

SULTAN: Search now, search everywhere!
ALADDIN: Jasmine, are you all right?
JASMINE: He's a snake.

(They sit down for a kiss, but SULTANI comes between them).

SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted advisor, is taking revenge
        for me all the time. It’s just awful. How can I ever - .
        (He stops mid-sentence and looks at the two men).
        Could that be true? My daughter ended up choosing one
        it feels like it's on the right? (She shakes her head) Ha ha! Praise be to Allah! YOU
        big man I can kiss you! I don't - I don't
        leave me alone.... Get married at the same time!
        The Snake The Snake. And you will be happier and more successful, as well.
        then my son, you will be my sultan!
ALADDIN: The Sultan?
SULTAN: Yes, a brave and honest young man like you
        a man of imperfect morality
        just what this kingdom needs! (ALADDIN points out
        worried about it.)

(Cut to JAFAR's room. JAFAR and IAGO enter.)

IAGO: We have to get out of here! We need to know… I need to know
        Start packing, Your Majesty. Only the most important things.
        (IAGO starts throwing things out of the cage.
        JAFAR smiles brightly.) Travel light! Bring it to me, please
        gun, pistol, knife (stands up and walks away
        his photo with JAFAR) and what
        Is this a picture? I don't know - I think I should make one
        there is a strange face. (JAFAR starts laughing wildly)
        Oh boy, did he go crazy. It's broken down. (IAGO) (IAGO) (IAGO)
        ran up to him and hit him on the head.) Jafar?
        Is that Jafar? Throw yourself down, Jafar! (JAFAR is everywhere
        back) Good catch!
JAFAR: Prince Ali is nothing but this kid in costume
        Aladdin is a brother. He has a lamp, Iago.
IAGO: Mun na a tea.
JAFAR: But you can get away with it!
Iago: Me, right?

(Cut to outside the palace. ALADDIN is looking out over the gardens).

ALADDIN: The Sultan? Do they want me to be their sultan?

(GENIE comes out of the lamp)

GENIUS: Huzzah! Congratulations to the winner! (Changes have been made
        a one-man band. He sees ALADDIN walking with him
        the head goes up. He stands, shakes his head, and reaches
        with this idea of ​​expanding it into ALADDIN . He has
        he raises his hand like a director framing a film and
        we'll get through them.) Aladi, you've won now
        princess heart What can you do
        following each other? (ALADDIN looks him away
        on the bed of sorrow where he breaks down and weeps.
        The GENIE regains consciousness, then swings towards him and kills the blacksmith
        the script is called "Aladdin". Row :)
        Psst, kumasen "liberate genien" ye.
        And oh again.
ALADDIN: Genius... N t'a fè.
GENIE: Of course you do. You just say “Genius, I need you
        free." (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses it
        He became a mock ventriloquist puppet . ALADDIN is far away.)
ALADDIN: I'm still thinking. I mean, I really mean it. But
        they wanted to make me a sultan - no!
        Prince Ali Sultan . If you are not I am Aladdin.
GENIE: Al, you win!
ALADDIN: For you! The only reason people think that of me
        all because of you. And if they knew that
        Am I really a king? (Calmly) How is it possible
        Does Jasmine know that? I'm taking it away. Genius, I can't do that
        keep it for myself. I don't want you to be free.
GENIE: (Sarcastic) Hey, I see. However,
        you lie to everyone. Hi, I'm starting
        Pretend you haven't been abandoned. Now if you will excuse me,
        consider. (And the last word is painfully spoken
        return the bean bag to the lamp.)

(ABU and CARPET look out the window).

ABU: Ohhoh: That’s a great example.
ALADDIN: Genie, I'm sorry. (The word comes out
        sucker and raspberries for her.) Well, nice. (She snorts
        pillow over the LAMP.) Just stay inside
        there! (Looks at ABU and MATO.) What are you doing?
        how many of you are watching ? (They both leave.) Look, it's me
        I'm sorry. Wait, Abu... wait... Basi, no.
        wait and come (Sighs.) What am I going to do?
        Genie is right: I have to tell Jasmine the truth.
JASMINE: (from a distance) Ali, you Ali, you coming here?
ALADDIN: (wearing turban) Well then. (He wanders around
        in the garden.) Jasmine? Where are you?

(We see IAGO put on his cloak, and stand on the wooden splits next to the FLAMINGO
    in the pond. It mimics the voice of JASMINE.)

IAGO: Huh... Quick on the Menager.
ALADDIN: I'm coming.

(We see ALADDIN running by, not the birds. IAGO laughs,
    then turns to face FLAMIGO, who
    pant.)

FLAMINGO: ¡Uh!
IAGO: What's up, pinky? (He cleaned the bird
        feet off the ground. IAGO runs into the palace
        to find a lamp under the pillow.) The boy, Jafarin
        Glad to see you guys! (rubs his forehead
        he looks JAFAR and reads.) Good work, Iago!
        (Normal) Ah, go ahead. (JAFAR) No, of course, to investigate
        from one to ten, you are eleven! (Normal) Ah, that's it.
        Jafar, you are so kind. I am ashamed, I am ashamed
        tears occur for a few moments. (Running the lantern).

(Cut into the palace. The SULTAN is standing up doing
    to tell the public.)

SULTAN: People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally a.
        cossie sisters!

(Cut to behind the curtain where JASMINE is watching. ALADDIN
    can be seen under the canopy.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine: Bamako?
JASMINE: Ali, i taara min?
ALADDIN: I have something for you.
JASMINE: The kingdom goes back to the father
        ad!
ALADDIN: No! But Jasmine, listen to me!
JASMINE: Good luck! (He threw himself on stage
        With SULTAN, where he sees everyone
        more.)
SULTAIN: ...A ye wulu ye!
ALADDIN: Oh, wow!

(Above, IAGO and JAFAR look out the window).

IAGO: Look at them, shaking the little whiner.
JAFAR: Let them sign.

 (He picks up the lantern and shakes it. The GENIUS appears).

GENIUS: You know Al, I got it (turns around to see JAFAR)
        really yyyyy -- I don't know. (E
        goes downstairs to find the poster.) Tonight
        Ali’s role is complex, dark and.
        the darkness of the wicked.
JAFAR: I am your master now. (Throw GENIUS
        on the ground and put his foot in the face of the GENIUS.)
GENIE: I was afraid of that.
JAFAR: Genie, give me my first wish. I'm going to remember it
        high, like a sultan!!!

(Cut to the dark clouds around the grave. The grave shakes.
    The roof cracks and SULTAN and ALADDIN collide.)

ALADDIN: ¡Waw!
SULTAN: Bless my soul. What is this? What is going on?

(His mane is off his head. If he catches it, it's his whole body
    run and then take off all their clothes except their boxers
     shortcuts are available. These costumes were reproduced in JAFAR.)

JAFAR: ¡Ey hey hey!
SULTAN: Jafar, you traitor.
IAGO: Yes, Traitorous Vile Sultan.
ALADDIN: Oh, what? Well, let's see! (animated) character
        picks up the same turban, but finds it empty) Lamp!
JAFAR: Interrogator- viewers, Abooboo.

(They both looked up and saw a huge GENIUS flying into the palace
    clouds... ALADDIN whistles and ALFORMA runs to greet him.
      They fly right next to GENI's head.)

ALADDIN: All right! No!
GENIE: Sorry, kid, I just got a new boss. (And he sat down
        a palace on a hill.)
SULTAN: Jafar, I must leave you alone!
JAFAR: Now there's a new order: my order! Finally, you
        !

(SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not).

JAFAR: We will never bow down to you!
IAGO: Why am I not surprised?
JAFAR: If you weren't bowing to the Sultan, you were
        kneel before the harlot ! (GENIUS) Genius, mine
        second desire - i want to be more active
        diɲɛ lagbɛrikɛla!

(GENIE raises his hand. ALADDIN tries to stop it, but fails,
    and another GENIE(tm) of thunder is JAFAR,
     to restore its original state).

IAGO: Brothers, welcome to Agrabah
        Old Jafar!
JAFAR: Where are you now? Ah yes, that is a great understatement!
        (He hits JASMINE and SULTAN with a stick, and.
        They both bowed down before him. RAJAH runs towards him.
        Hit RAJAH and the tiger turns into a little dog.
        cat.) Above, baby! Oh princess… (lifts her chin
        with his team ) - who would I die for
        you have to complete it.
ALADDIN: (off camera) Jafar! Don't touch it!

(JAFAR steals ALADDIN. He escapes.)

JAFAR: Prince Ali here
    yes it is so
    But not as you know.
    Read my lips and understand
    Lakika

(JAFAR combines them both in the air).

    Yes, face a bulge from your past
    Whose lie was so good, they didn’t last forever
    Thank you Prince Ali!

(JAFAR takes ALI back to ALADDIN.)

IAGO: Or should I say Aladdin?
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I tried to tell you.

JAFAR: So Ali was Aladdin
    Like cheating, go for it?
    Believe me, please
    A jogoɲumanya
    Give me a good reason
    Send him to pack with a one-way ticket
    So their future prospects are forever in jeopardy
    His stuff hangs, the place is chosen
    It’s the end of the world, oops!
    Good bye,
IAGO: Hello, see you soon!
JAFAR: Former Prince Ali!

(JAFAR returns ABU to normal. He sends them both...
    a heavy pile, and throw it like a missile, but don't take it out of the nose
    MATO enters F2B, and we see an empty void, somewhere
    the pillar collapses. Finally it stopped .
    ALADDIN appears, visibly cool.)

ALADDIN: Is it Abu? Abu! (Looks at the shaking mountain
        snow.) Oh, this is all my fault - I must
        I let my genes out when I could. (She is being investigated
        He took off ABU and shook his jacket.) Abu!
        Do you agree with me? I am Abu, I am garbage
        everything, in one form or another. I'll go back and sit down
        things are very interesting. (He starts walking through the snow,
        and ends up walking on a cool ALFORMA.)
        Rug! (He looks up to see that ALFORMA is closed
        the pillar (pillar). He fights to try and save ALFORMA . THE
        he can't do that , so he starts snoring
        standing base.) Abu, start to dance! is
        the! (Potatoes eventually grew extensively and.
        the pillar begins to rise. ALADDIN survives, .
        looks back and then sits down. Pilar is called
        back to him, if he went ALADDIN with
        ABU let her sit with her open
        pillar window.) Yes! Light! (THE
        Look at the turban he makes out of fear of the ABU.
        MATTO flaps his wings and runs to get it
        u ta.) Sisan, segin Agrabah! An ka taa!

(An bɛ an ɲɛsin Agrabah ja belebeleba ma, sankaba bilenmanw ye min datugu.

        in the hands of the world’s greatest.
        (She raises her hand and the crown appears.) What are you doing?
        like honey Why, when the queen.

(Takes a glass of wine and throws it in his face).

JASMINE: Of course!
JAFAR: I want to learn growth! (As he pulls it back
        and raised his hand to strike him. Then he gets up.) No.
        Genius, I decided to make my last wish. I
        i hope princess jazmine is weak
        love with me

(We see ALADDIN running back into town).

GENIE: (turns you into Buckley again) Ah, Master... there's more
        farankanw, sɛbɛnniw
JAFAR: Don't answer me, you stupid green man! YOU
        I will do what I say, slave!

(JASMINE looks up to see ALADDIN waving at her window
    play at the same time.)

JASMINE: (Standing up and placing the crown on her head).
        Jafar is a country! I never realized how amazing that was
        you are so beautiful.

(Slap you NERO).

JAFAR: That’s better. (It's a GENIUS lipstick.
        shadow.) Now, Kitty, tell me more
        it's you and it's the head.
JASMINE: You're tall, well-dressed...

(JAFAR approaches him. ALADDIN jumps in with ABU and GENI
    can see them.)

GENIUS: Al! Al, little buddy!
ALADDIN: ¡Shh!
GENIE: (Actually opens and closes his mouth).
        Al, I can't help you. I work for a psychiatric patient .
        NOW. (His head consists of JAFAR and neck).
ALADDIN: Hey, I'm a street dog, remember? (He smirks at GENI
        da.) I'm going to improvise.

(He drops a bunch of coins and hides them near JAFAR and JASMINE.
    JAFAR turns his back on ALADDIN.)

JAFAR: Jatka and so on.
JASMINE: And your hair is... well... curly! (He's got it
        his arm around her. He pretends they move with him
        thumbs up, but really gesturing to ALADDIN
        Below. He's doing his walking. IAGO observed.)

IAGO: Gag--mmmmmm it works! (ABU grabs her and shuts her mouth).
JAFAR: What is a street dog?
JASMINE: Some street dogs?

(They are kissing as IAGO manages to knock over the bowl. JAFAR
    he turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him and kisses him. His name is ALADDIN
     the appearance of it is disgusting. (IAGO and ABU look angry).

ABU: And the di!
JAFAR: He's... (seeing ALADDIN pointing at him
        crown.) Yeah!! How many times have I
        den ka i faga ?

 (He steals ALADDIN away. JASMINE falls towards him
    below. ALADDIN quickly grabs the wand.)

ALADDIN: Take the lantern!

(JASMINE runs towards him. But JAFAR pushes ALADDIN away
    put it on an hourglass.)

JAFAR: Ah, ah, ah, princess - Your time is up!

(Sand starts falling on him from above).

ALADDIN: Jasmine is a job!
IAGO: Oh, good luck, Jaf... (Knocks ABU.)

(ABU runs towards the lamp).

JAFAR: Don't play with me! (He becomes a toy monkey.
ALADDIN: ¡Abu!


(TAPIT arrives soon.)

JAFAR: Things are moving fast now, kid. (ALFORMA is.
        moderate and moderate. ALADDIN runs towards him
        lamp.) Do you understand? (His path is blocked
        great swords hanging on the ground. JAFAR took power
        lamp and laughter are frightening. ALADDIN is a
        the sword came out of the ground.) I'm just warming up
        above! (He spits the Ring of Fire around ALADDIN.)
ALADDIN: You're afraid to fight me about yourself, coward
        Qatar jamana na?
JAFAR: Well, right? You might want to try it out
        I'd look like a snake! (It’s still funny, too.
        I saw a snake come out of the back of his mouth
        teeth. Then he turned into a giant cobra and.
        The ring of fire next to ALADDIN is real
        a dragon coils around ALADDIN. The snake was created by JAFAR
        He goes to ALADDIN and looks at ALADDIN on the third
        the sword struck JAFAR and struck. It’s called GENIUS
        entertainers wearing A-line sweaters.)

GENIUS: Rickem, rockem, racem, rake - stick and sword
        Aka Katari!
JAFAR: Get away from it!

(GENIE points to a small pennant with a “J” on it.)

GENIUS: (weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man - if he can't,
        GLORY TO YOU!

(ALADDIN takes advantage of the distraction where the hourglass takes a break.
    JASMINE is freaking out. However, JAFAR notices him and blocks the way.
     ALADDIN falls and loses his sword.)

JASMINE: Aladdin!

(ALADDIN jumps on a boulder and throws it to the ground, catching it
    the sword is in the way. He rounds the corner, but the snake goes after him
    can't make it , and JAFAR's face is glued to the wall and
    hanging outside the palace. ALADDIN jumped on the snake
     stabbed him to death. JAFAR shouted in anger. ALADDIN tries again
     saving the princess.)

ALADDIN: ¡Suyt'am, Jasmine, Bamako, Mali!

(He almost hits the glass with his sword, when JAFAR grabs him).

JAFAR: (laughs evil) You little fool! You're right
        you can defeat the strongest animal on earth!
IAGO: (GENIUS hovering behind him) Fuck him, .
        Jafar – It’s like – awk! (GENIE shakes it off
        out of the way) .
JAFAR: Without a genie, my son, you are nothing!
ALADDIN: (thinkingly) Shadow! Black! Black
        stronger than you will ever be!
JAFAR: We!!
ALADDIN: He gave me your power, and he can take it back!
GENIE: Al, what are you doing? Why did you come with me
        internal ?
ALADDIN: Believe me, Jafar: you're still just a stopgap!
JAFAR: You are right! His power is stronger than mine! But
        it doesn't last long!

(JAFAR turns around GENIUS).

GENIUS: This guy is crazy. He’s a little drunk. A
        too much fighting with snakes (hands).
        turns into a snake and hits him on the head with it.)
JAFAR: Who, I make my third wish! I want to be perfect
        mighty genie!
GENIE: (reluctantly) Well, your will is my command.
        Suma lurtatawa, Al.

(GENIE defeated JAFAR with the last flash of the GENIE (tm) title.
    JAFAR’s dead form turns into consciousness. And
     LOOK at JASMINE'S long arm disappearing into the sand. His name is ALADDIN
    falls and eventually breaks the glass. The beauty and the princess
     to the grass.)

JAFAR: Yes! Than! Can! The power is complete!
JASMINE: (to ALADDIN) What have you done?
ALADDIN: Believe it or not!

(A blue lantern appears from JAFAR's base. JAFAR spells).

JAFAR: The earth is mine, I send it, I rule it!
ALADDIN: Don't worry, Jafar! Are you forgetting something?
    (JAFAR looks at him curiously) You want to be smart, e
    I understand! And everything that goes with it!

(Men on JAFAR arms).

JAFAR: Yes! Yes!
IAGO: I'm going! Come on, tell the truth
        genius, I don't care.

(IAGO tries to escape, but JAFAR catches him.)

ALADDIN: So much art! A very small community.
GENIUS: Al, you little genius, you!

(ABU recovers, MATO goes up, JASMINE, SULTAN
    and RAJAH is added. RAJAH jumped on his shoulder
     SULTANIA, so everyone changes. SULTAN is very difficult
     There is the weight of the new RAJAH. The palace reappeared
     where he was in town. ALADDIN is captured
    anpulu school.)

JAFAR: (both under the lamp.) Turn away.
        Where are the timers?
IAGO: Oh, shut up, you fool!
JAFAR: I'm not telling you to shut up!
GENIE: I'm sorry. (He takes the lantern and walks over
        on the porch. He now wears a baseball cap. THE
        he pretends to throw the spark, but he turns it on
        cut down the logs and throw them into the forest
        with his hand.) In the Valley of Ten Thousand Years
        kabakow ka lafiɲɛ a ma!

(JAFAR ni IAGO bɛ taa a fɛ ka sɔsɔli kɛ u tununtɔ. JASMINE bɛ taa.

ALADDIN: Jasmine, ne ye nkalon tigɛ i ye a

JASMINE: Oh nin jɔn hakilintan in. A ma tilen, ne b i kanu.

ALADDIN: Nka Genie, i ka hɔrɔnya dun?
GENIE: Hey, that's just lifelong slavery. is
        love. (She sits down next to him.) Al, you see that
        I can't find another girl like her in a million
        years. Believe me, I know. I'm looking at it.
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I love you, but I have to stop
        making it seem like something I don't have.
JASMINE: N b’a ye.

(They glance one last time, and ALADDIN returns
    For online learning.)

ALADDIN: Genie, I want you free.
GENIUS: A true pedigree of the next King. What do I have ?
ALADDIN: (He waves his lantern at GENIUS.) Genius, you are
        knocking it out of there!

(A rotation follows where the chains fell
    The GENI arm and lantern fell uselessly to the ground.
     GENIE took it and looked down.)

GENIE: (Incredulous.) Hey, hey! I am free to go. am
        free. (He hands the lantern to ALADDIN.) Quickly,
        quick, expecting something extraordinary. “I am going to ride
        The country of the Nile. I want Niili. Give it a try!
ALADDIN: I wait for the Nile.
GENIE: Not so!! (He laughs hysterically. He rebounds
        like the big pin machine on the balcony.) Oh, Please
        OK! I am free! I am finally free! I'm getting up
        process. I want to explore the world! I--

(He picks up his suitcase, but looks down when he sees ALADDIN staring at him
    that is very sad.)

ALADDIN: Genie, I love you.
GENIE: I mean, Al. You do whatever anyone says
        to be a boss to me.

(They kiss. The SULTAN steps forward.)

SULTAN: That's right. You've certainly proved your worth
        for it comes to me. What this rule is
        jan walt'a.
JASMINE: The father?
SULTAN: Well, am I the Sultan or am I the Sultan? Since then
        henceforth the princess will judge whomever she marries
        will.
JASMINE: (With a big smile, she runs into ALADDIN's arms).
        HE! I choose... I choose you, Aladdin.
ALADDIN: Yes, hon. Call me Al.

(They were about to kiss, long arms gathering them all together.
    GENIE wears a Hawaiian suit with golf clubs and a Goofy hat
     sombrero.)

GENIE: Oh, all of you. Come here. Great group hugs!
        Do you mind if I kiss the monkey? (Kissing ABU.) Ooh, .
        it’s so heartbreaking! Well, you can't do any more damage here
        this ice cream show . I'm going to go! Bye,
        you two lover in the dark. Hello, Rugman: ciao! am
        history! No, I am a mythologist! No, I didn't do anything
        what am I, free!

(GENIUS flies into the black sky, leaving a rap of sparks
    in the background. They cut it (the jumping makes it worse) .
     to the exploding fireworks in the twilight. We are on our knees watching
     ALADDIN and JASMINE running on a RUG.)

ALADDIN: A new world
JASMINE: A new life
PANI: (chorus off-camera) Ne ni e ye!
MAN COURT: New era!

(They run and disappear in the moonlight,
    the moon rises to reveal NERO's laughter. Suddenly
    filmed "in the spotlight", GENIUS takes
     and looks at the audience.)

GENIUS: I did like!

(Restore the film, restore the moon. Black fading.
    Laban.)

[Above the dunes, Agrabah appears. Indeed, it is the palace that dominates the view, and the pirate sings as he approaches the city limits.]

The seller is:

♪ Arabian Nights as Arabian Days ♪

♪ And the c'a la, and the suma, and the suma ♪

♪ In so many ways! ♪

[The camera pans to a city street where the fire eater is doing his thing. He spits out fireworks, which brings us back to the hero.]

♪ The Thousand and One Nights, under the Arabian Moon ♪

♪ Confused, disorganized, prone to falling and hitting hard ♪

♪ Dune ♪

[An exhausted camel falls on all fours, trembling with tears, and its driver rolls it violently behind him.
Shakes hands when talking to examiner(s)].

Peddler: Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. (greeting) Please come closer.

[Camera zooms in on the customer's face].

Salesman: (embarrassed) Ugh... Too close. It’s a little shorter .

[Fortunately for the characters, the camera pulls back a bit].

Peddler: Ah, there is. Welcome to Agrabah... (lights the bonfire) Secret City... (shakes the camel's head) Charm...

[He puts the sack on the camel's back, which at once becomes the stall of a richly decorated bazaar].

Peddler: And good stuff here on Jordan's side, they're on sale today. I want to get lost. Uh huh.

[He pulls a vase barely visible from the stage above.]

Peddler: Look. Than. Hookah and coffee makers together . (dipped in soy sauce) Also use julienned potatoes. There is no accusation.
(He lays it on the table) It won't matter...

[Boo! The top appears.]

Pedlar: (silently) It's broken. (throws it aside) Oh! Let’s take a look. (pulls the box) Never seen one intact.
This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware . Hear...

[Opens a raspberry and sniffs it for effect].

Peddler: Ah, that's good.

[Now it’s clear: not pleasant. The camera starts to move away from the hero, who is trying desperately to capture us.]

Salesman: (shakes his head) Wait, don't leave! (laughs) I find I'm only interested in very little stuff.
I guess then you would be well rewarded for thinking… this.

[The merchant takes the iconic lantern from his wrist and holds it in his hand affectionately.]

Pedlar: Don't let the simple appearance fool you. Like so many other things, it's not what's on the outside that counts, it's what's on the inside.

[The camera pans again. But the seller doesn't give up, trying once again to stay in front of buyers].

Pedlar: (sadly) This is no ordinary lantern! It changed the young man’s life.
The boy who loved the lantern was more than he was. (looks around, sniffs) Diamond in the rough. (laughs) .
Maybe you want to hear a story?

[The merchant pours the glittering dust from the lamp onto his hands...].

Pedlar: The dark night begins…

[...throwing it into the sky, where it creates a night of stars.]

Peddler (vo): Where the dark man waits... with dark purposes...

(The camera pans to an open forest where Jafar is waiting on the floor of the hilltop horse dirt.
His companion, the parrot Iago, is still perched on his shoulder, while a slightly smudged figure approaches them from the darkness.
The rookie Gazeem dismounted and congratulated the pair.]

Jafar: I ye late.

Gazeem: (kneeling) So, sorry, oh patient.

Jafar: So you get it?

Gazeem: I had to cut some of my lips, but I did it.

[Pulls out a locket: half gold. Jafar reached out to take it, but Gazeem took it].

Gazeem: That’s a great example. (She holds out her free hand) Treasure.

[Iago shouts as he passes and grabs the locket].

Gazeem: Good!

Jafar: I ka da ne la, n terikɛ. Fɛn min bɛ na i ma, i bɛ o sɔrɔ.

Iago: Mun de bè i la? O la sa, o ye hakilina ɲuman ye dɛ!

(Jafar bɛ locket tilancɛ tɔ ta. A bɛ jɛɲɔgɔnya kɛ n’u ye ka sanu wulu dɔ kɛ. A bɛ balo ka pan ka taa).

Jafar: I ka teliya! Aw ka tugu sira la!

(So ​​kan, u saba bɛ locket gɛn ka tɛmɛ kungo kɔnɔ min falen bɛ kalo yeelen na)

Jafar: Teliya ka tɛmɛ o kan!

[Danfɛn in bɛ tila tilayɔrɔ fila la, u fila bɛɛ bɛ da cɛncɛn dɔ kɔnɔ. jara kunkolo kabakoma dɔ bɛ wuli ka bɔ dunun in na .
dakunw sɔgɔlenw bɛ laban a ɲɛw la minnu bɛ manamana . Cɛw ka sow bɛ kɔrɔta u kɔfɛsenw kan k’u ka sow fili.
Jafar bɛ nisɔndiya, jara kunkolo b’a da dingɛ da].

[sow bɛ pɛrɛn].

[nɛnɛ ka kasi].

Jafar: Finally, after years of searching… Wonderland Cave.

Iago: Awk. Wonderful hole!

Gazeem: ( sighs) By Allah…

Jafar: Now you have to decide. Bring me a lamp! The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is... mine. [laugh]

(Gazeem begins to approach the mouth of the beast, at the mouth of the cave. He laughs as he walks).

Iago: Oh lamp. Oh, lamp. (Now it's just Iago and Jafar, with Iago opening the door in normal English.) Damn, where did you get that bozo?

(Jafar puts his hand over his mouth and shuts it up. Gazeem crawls to the edge of the cave.
He's looking intently at the inside of his mouth as his lips turn into a vine.
He clung to a lion's tooth, but was startled by the sound of voices in the valley).

Cave: [echo growling] Who disturbed my sleep?

Gazeem: [the thief whispers] I, Gazeem, humble thief.

Ding: You should know that. Only one can come here. Which is worth a long time. Diamonds are hard.

(Gazeem turns to Jafar with a questioning look).

Jafar: What are you waiting for? Jack is the one.

[animal pride] .

(Gazeem hesitates to step into the cave with one foot. With great fear he drops his foot. Nothing happens.
He breathes deeper and deeper. Then another scream. It turns, but the beast's mouth opens, and the drum returns to normal.
All that remains are Jafar, Iago and two separate half-medals.)

Jafar: DO IT!

Ding: Ask him... the hardest diamond...

Iago: [sighs] I can't believe it. I believe in the truth! We will never put our hands on that stupid lamp!
Forget about it! Let’s take a look. Let’s take a look. I was coughing so hard and wanted to pee. (He runs into Jafar's arms).

Jafar: Be patient, Iago. Patience. Gazeem wasn’t very good.

Iago: (very nervous) Oh, that's awesome. It’s incredible… I think I’m going to die from this weird heart attack.
What are we going to do? We have a big problem here, a big problem…

[Jafar rubs his elbow].

Jafar: Yes. Only one can enter. I have to find this, this… diamond.

(Cut to top, Aladdin is running up the hill with the horn. He almost falls from the sky).

Razoul: Don't give up! Thief! I'll take the trophy from you, street dog!

Aladdin: (Looks back, then down, then towards the bread.) Is this all bread? Oooooh yeah!

(He jumps down on two ropes strung between horses, his clothes dry.
He looks at them and picks up his own clothes as he goes.
Finally, he approaches the end of the rope near the window as he reaches to close the blinds.
Aladdin hits the blinds and falls into the street. A few awnings and a pile of clothes around him break his fall.
She takes off her first dress, and is about to eat her bread when...)

Guard 1: Over there!

Guard 2: You won't get over this easily!

Aladdin: You thought that was easy?

(Looks at the three women mockingly).

Razoul: You two, this way, and you, follow me. We'll get it.

(Aladdin puts on a cloak to cover himself to hide himself. He runs to the women).

Aladdin: Hello, ladies.

Woman 1: We had a bit of trouble this morning, didn't we Aladdin?

Aladdin: Is there a problem? You are welcome. You only get in trouble when you get caught.

(A hand grabs Aladdin's arm and pulls him back. It's Razoul. Aladdin's mask falls off).

Razoul: I found you!

Aladdin: I'm in trouble.

Razoul: And this time... (Abu shouts, pulling the guard's hat over his eyes. Abu points to the guard's head, laughing).

Aladdin: Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

Ash: Hee.

Aladdin: Come on. Let’s get out of here. am.

(The guard throws Aladdin, but he misses the fish barrel. Abu waddles the guard, then dodges the attack. Aladdin then drops the guard's pants)

♪ A board before the end ♪

♪ Going a little further ♪

♪ I only steal what I can't sell ♪ That's all.

(Aladdin escapes, the guard gives him a fish like pants from his lower body).

♪ One step ahead of the standard ♪

♪ That’s it, and it’s no joke ♪

♪ These guys don't want me broke! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu run into a pile of barrels and knock out the guards).

Guard: (to someone) ♪ Riffraff! ♪

♪ You look like a street! ♪

♪ Namarkɛla! ♪

(throws fruit at Aladdin) ♪ Take it! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Just a little food, guys. ♪

Guard: ♪ Tear it up, take it back, guys! ♪

(Aladdin runs up the stage. The guards move the stage back and forth to try and pull him down).

Aladdin: ♪ I see ♪

♪ I have to face facts ♪

(Aladdin jumps off the stage to his very death to hold Abu's hands like an acrobat. The two jump up in the harem).

♪ ¡Juma sapakïtawa, Abu! ♪

Harem Girls: Who?

♪ Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom ♪

(Abou gets a bowl full of fruit and puts it in his mouth like a chipmunk).

♪ He became celibate to increase crime ♪

Woman 2: ♪ I want to blame the parents, but they don't want to. ♪

Aladdin: ♪ I must eat to live, ♪

♪ I can steal food ♪

♪ Will tell you all about it when he has time! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu come out and run across the canvas. They cut off a muscular man who is stalking through the crowd. The guards rush in."
Cut to Aladdin and Abu following the muscle man as he walks and makes mistakes and gets seen. )

♪ Jump forward slowly. ♪

♪ One step before I lost. ♪

♪ Next time I will name the pen. ♪

Razoul: There it is!

(It's a sequence in which Aladdin and Abu run through a herd of sheep pursued by guards and attack an artist lying on a metal stool.
[actually a giant guard descends on him])

Aladdin: ♪ Pan in the presence of assassins ♪

♪ One step ahead of the pack ♪

♪ I think I'll take a walk in the neighborhood ♪

(Abou b'a yɛrɛ kɛ biyew ye fo jagokɛla k'a sɔrɔ).

Cɛ 1: ♪ Kana dabila, son! ♪

Aljiri 1: 🔥 ¡Vandal!

Aladini: ♪ ¡Abu! ♪

Muso 3: ♪ Scandal ye! ♪

Aladin: ♪ Kana teliya kojugu ♪

(Aladdin lamininen don ni GARDIW ye da ɲɛfɛ. Da bɛ da wuli, muso janyalen jugu dɔ bɛ don)

Muso: ♪ N hakili la o ka di hali bi! ♪

(Aladdin bɛ a biri ka bolo di garadikɛ ma, k’a kɛ i n’a fɔ bɛɛ ye teri ye).

Aladin: ♪ Ne ka kan ka dumuni kɛ walasa ka ɲɛnamaya, ♪

♪ Ne bɛ se ka dumuni sonya ♪

♪ N'o tɛ, aw ka hɛrɛ sɔrɔ! ♪

Garadi: I KAN'A SƆRƆ!

(Gradiw bɛ pan Aladdin kan, nka marifa cilen don. A ka penti bɛ girin dagaw kan)

Kuntigi: A sɔrɔ!

(Aladdin leaps towards the artist, who is walking safely through the hot ashes. The guards run through the ashes, burning their feet and jumping in pain.
Aladdin and Abu encounter a sword eater, and Abu turns around to remove the sword from the eater's mouth. (Abu goes to the guards, who stand in fear).

Guard: He has a sword!

Razoul: You idiots. We all have swords!

(The guards draw their swords. Abu lowers his sword and runs. Aladdin and Abu are surrounded again, guards coming from left and right.
(He jumps up on a stunt suit that lands on the street while all the guards shoot at each other).

Aladdin: ♪ He jumps before my feet ♪

Guardians: Destruction!

Aladdin: ♪ Jumps before the hump ♪

Guardianaka: Mosquitoes on the road!

Aladdin: ♪ One stop before disaster strikes ♪

Guardianaka: ¡Namarkɛla!

Aladdin: ♪ They go fast, but I am fast ♪

Garadi: Come on!

(The guards chase Aladdin up the stairs and into the room. He grabs the rug...)

Aladdin: ♪ Done, ♪

♪ It’s better for you to be on ♪

♪ I want a better world, ♪

♪ All you have to do is jump! ♪

(..flying out the window like a carpet is magic.
The guards chased him through the window, but fell on the way.
land marked "Mad Hakim's Discount Fertilizer" on a fertilizer wagon. )

Guards: Glad! Hey!

(Aladdin uses the carpet as a parachute for a safe landing. Aladdin and Abu greet each other)

Aladdin: And now, honorable effendi, we celebrate. Light.

(Aladdin divided the bread into two halves and gave half to Abu, who began to eat.
But Aladdin looked up and saw two kids searching for food in the dumpster.
The girl sees him, then throws away what she's got and tries to hide. Aladdin looks down at them, then at the bread, then at Abouta.)

Abu: Nam, nam! Voi ei.

(Abou takes a bite of his food, but Aladdin gets up and approaches the children. The girl pushes her brother back).

Aladdin: [sighs] This is great. Jack is the one. You have to take it.

(The children laugh with delight. Abu tries to swallow his mouth, then looks guilty. He walks over to the children and hands them his bread.
They patted his head with delight).

Abu: Ah, don't do that. Or did he see her ?

(ABU sees ALADDIN coming into the sunlight where the parade is taking place. ALADDIN looks over the shoulders of the crowd.
See PRINCE ACHMED on horseback.)

PASSENGER 1: On Palace Road, I guess.

BYSTANDER 2: Another sucker for the princess.

(ALADDIN is surprised when two children run across the alley. TRUTH surprises him as he runs in front of ACHMED's house).

ACHMED: ¡Nayan thakijat bɔli, brat!

(ACHMED raises his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN jumps in front of them and grabs the whip).

ALADDIN: Hey, if I were as rich as you, I'd trade in virtue!

ACHMED: Oh, n b'i kalan taama na!

(ACHMED throws ALADDIN into a pit. The audience laughs at him).

ALADDIN: Look, Abu. It’s not every day you see horses two back!

(ACHMED turns back to ALADDIN.)

AHMED: Oh my God! You are a worthless street dog! You are born a street dog, you die a street dog and only dogs cry for you.

(ALADDIN runs to ACHMED, but the cage door closes in his face).

ALADDIN: I'm not fucking. And I don’t have dogs. And, Abu. Let's go home.

(ALADDIN drives home with a look, then returns to ABU at night).

ALADDIN: Riffraff, street dogs. I didn't buy it. If they had looked closer, would they have seen the poor man? Not the father. They would know there was more in me.

(He pulls back a curtain to reveal a grand palace.) One day, Abu, things will change.
We are rich, we live in a palace, we have absolutely no problems.

(Blowing the same scene until day time. Cut to the interior of the SULTAN's bedroom. The door opens and PRINCE ACHMED rushes in, the back of his trousers missing.)

ACHMED: I've never been so embarrassed.

SULTAN: Oh Prince Ahmed. You wouldn’t leave so soon, would you?

ACHMED: Bonne chance ka furu a ma.

SULTAN: Oh Jasmine. Jasmine is doing well! Jasmine is doing well! (The SULTAN goes to the garden in search of his daughter.
He finds it but is stopped by RAJAH, JASMINE's pet withers. RAJAH wears a PRINCE ACHMED hat.
The SULTAN grabbed the cloth and pulled it out of the RAJAH's mouth.) Rajah mindless! That's why Prince Ahmed is so strong!

JASMINE: Oh, Daddy. The Rajah was playing with him, of course. (RAJAH comes over and puts his arm around JASMINE and lets her kiss him).
You're playing an overdressed, defensive Prince Ahmed, aren't you?
(She leans into RAJAH, smiling ever since, looking angrily at her father.) Ahem.

SULTAN: My dear brother, you must not ignore all the couples who call you. The law says so.

BOTH: ...to marry a prince.

(He heads towards the pigeon cage).

SULTAN: Until next birthday.

JASMINE: The law is wrong.

SULTAN: Just three days!

JASMINE: Dad, I hate this. (He takes the dove out of the cage and squashes it.) If you marry, I want it to be love.

SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not just this rule. (He gives the dove a hand and sends her back into the cage).
I won't be here forever and I want you to be seen and cared for.

JASMINE: Try to understand. I never did anything on my own. (She waves her hand in the pond, shaking it at the fish).
I never had any real friends. (RAJH smirks at him.) Except you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he went back to bed).
I never left the palace walls.

SULTAN: But Jasmine, you are a princess.

JASMINE: So maybe she doesn't want to be a princess anymore. (He blows the water).

SULTAN: Oooohhh! God bless you daughters!

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a moment. JASMINE goes to the pigeon house and opens the door. Heroes fly for freedom. She watches him go.
The value of the int. from the SULTAN's court.)

SULTAN: I don't know where he got it. Her mother was not such a choice. (An earthquake falls on him. He looks up in surprise and sees JAFAR).
Oh no, I don't. Ah, Jafar, my most trusted mentor. I want you to know.

JAFAR: My whole life is to serve you, sir. (He bows his head).

SULTAN: He looks like this pretender. Jasmine doesn't want to choose a man. I am at the end of the row.

IAGO: (in a parrot voice) Aww! Turning the head .

SULTAN: Ah, yes, yes. Good luck, pretty Polly! (He pulls a cookie from his pocket. IAGO looks surprised. Then the SULTAN puts it in Iago's mouth.
IAGO blushes as he tries to eat. Both JAFAR and SULTANI laugh.)

JAFAR: His Majesty must have trouble with gentle animals. (IAGO looks at him.) Now maybe you can figure out how to solve this difficult problem.

SULTAN: The only one who can help is you.

JAFAR: Ah, but you had to use the Mystic Blue Diamond for that.

SULTAN: Oh, my ring? But it’s been in the family for years.

JAFAR: We need to find a mate for the princess. (JAFAR uses the word "princess" with emphasis on the second syllable "cess".
He swings the cobra-headed staff towards the SULTAN. The servants' eyes began to light up. The room goes dark, and JAFAR's voice gradually deepens.
THE SULTAN has startling eyes.) Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

SULTAN: Everything...will be easier...well.

JAFAR: Nka diamantw.

SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Everything you need is well laid out.

(The SULTAN takes out the ring and gives it to JAFAR. JAFAR takes out the scepter and returns the room to normal).

JAFAR: You are very kind, Liege. Now run and play with your little toys.

SULTAN: (Still hypnotized) Yes... that's... very interesting.

(JAFAR and IAGO leave. We follow them. As we leave the room, the parrot smells cookies).

IAGO: I can't take it anymore! When I finally squeeze in another one of those disgusting cookie molds… bam! Beat!

(JAFAR pulls out a rope, revealing a hidden entrance to their house).

JAFAR: Calm down, Iago.

IAGO: Then I grabbed his head. Beat! Beat!

JAFAR: (Addressing IAGO.) Soon I will be the Sultan, not this confused fool.

IAGO: And then I threw the cookies in his mouth! Haha!

(Two couples enter the door and giggle. Diss. comes out of the garden at night. A dark man enters. We see JASMINE in disguise.
He reached the palace wall and began to climb it. RAJAH threw it behind him.)

JASMINE: Oh, I mean, Rajah. But I can't stay here, I can live my life too. I will miss you.
(She resumes her climb, assisted by RAJAH, who begins to moan and complain.) Thank you!

(He disappears over the wall. The daylight cuts into the street. ALADDIN and ABU are resuming their craft. Under the cover of the fruit stand).

ALADDIN: Do it, Object. That's it!

(ABU dives and looks DOWN.)

HOPE: (To the owners) Try that, and your taste buds will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and holds it, confusing him).
Hey, get your feet out.

ABU: Blah blah!

ANSWER: Well i. Get out of here you filthy monkey.

(He grabs the melon from ABU's hand. But ahead, ALADDIN bends down and picks up another melon from the table.)

ABU: Good morning.

(Now he gets up. The GUEST brings the melon in front of him, where he places it on the mound. He looks confused, as if he just did it).

ALADDIN: Very well, Abu. Breakfast will be provided.

(ALADDIN and ABU open a melon on the roof and eat it. We see JASMINE walking down the street).

SHOP 1: Good lady, buy a bowl. There could be no better vessel made of copper or silver.

SELLER 2: Sweet dates, sweet dates and figs! Sweet dates with pistachios!

SHOP 3: Should a woman wear a necklace? Beautiful necklace of a beautiful woman.

(He loves travel, but is shocked when a fish falls on his face).

4 SHOP: Fresh fish! We caught them, you bought them!

JASMINE: I don't think so. (She turns back, but runs to the fire eater and is surprised by the fire.) Sorry.
(She eats, then puts the fire in her mouth. JASMINE hates it. She's happy to rub her stomach. ALADDIN notices, a strange look coming to his face.) I'm wasting forgiveness come on, of course.

ALADDIN: (Obviously loving it.) Wow.

(He throws his cloak over Hood's head. ABU sees this, jumps into his arms, and waves his hand over ALADDIN'S face.)

ABU: That’s a great example. Good morning? Good morning?

(JASMINE is standing in a fruit stand and sees a homeless kid asking for fruit. She picks one up and gives it to him).

JASMINE: Oh, you must be hungry. Here’s what’s there. (The boy runs away).

HOPE: You better be able to pay.

JASMINE: (Mixed) Jig?

BOTTOM LINE: No one stole my bike.

JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I don't have any money.

IMAGE: Thief.

JASMINE: Please, if you'll let me go to the palace, I can take you from the Sultana.

HOPE: Do you know the penalty for stealing?

(He grabs her hand and wraps it around the table, intending to cut it).

JASMINE: Ayi, ayi, barika Ala ye.

(The sword is thrown, but is stopped by ALADDIN'S hand).

ALADDIN: Thank you, good sir. I'm so glad you found it. I'm looking for you everywhere.

JASMINE: ( giggling) What are you doing?

ALADDIN: (chuckles back) Kidding.

HOPE: Do you know this girl?

ALADDIN: Most likely, yes. She is my sister. He’s a bit crazy. (Puts his hand to his ear. Surprises him. JUST grabs him by his jacket).

REPRESENTATIVE: He says he knows the Sultan.

ALADDIN: He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

(ABU packs his bags. He hears that, then stands up. JASMINE, bows to ABU playfully.)

JASMINE: Oh wise Sultan. How can I serve you?

ABU: Ayi, bla bla bla.

ALADDIN: Sad, isn't it? (He leans forward and grabs another apple from the carrot with his foot).
But there is no problem. (She walks toward Jasmine.) Come on, sister. It’s time to go to the doctor.

JASMINE: (to a camel standing nearby) Hi Doctor. How will this be done?

ALADDIN: No, no, no. Don’t be afraid. (To ABU, whose bags are expanding.) Come, Sultan.

(ABU bows to the crowd and throws everything he stole from the cart).

REPRESENTATIVE: Is it good? What is this? (ABU grabs what he took and the three of them escape.) Get back here, little thieves!

(Cut in JAFAR's lab. IAGO spins a gear inside a strange device. A storm rages over the machine.)

[bɔgɔbɔgɔli] .

IAGO: (blushing and gasping) With all due respect, Rot, can't we just wait out the real storm?

JAFAR: Hold your breath, Iago. More immediately. (Use SULTAN's train machine).

IAGO: Yes, mighty Evil. [sighs] .

(IAGO runs fast. Flames go through the ring to the hourglass below. The center begins to melt.)

JAFAR: Nothing, sands of time. Tell me who is in the valley.
(Beautiful head opens Wonder Cave.
He fell in a storm, but ALADDIN is climbing a ladder, and JASMINE is covered.)
Snake Snake! Here’s what’s there. My diamond is hard.

IAGO: Is he right? Is this the payoff you’ve been waiting for? (IAGO loses his footing and goes into the gears).

JAFAR: Let's give the guards a call to the palace, okay?

(IAGO crosses over and bangs the head against the wall).

IAGO: They were. [cough]

(JAFAR laughs menacingly, the camera zooms in on the dust storm with ALADDIN.
Finally, we join the real ALADDIN, who climbs the stairs, followed by JASMINE.)

[dusukasi ŋɛɲɛ].

ALADDIN: I'm already there.

(JASMINE rises up next to him, but falls and falls into ALADDIN's arms. He stands up).

JASMINE: I want to thank you for catching this guy.

ALADDIN: Forget it. (Holds the bar.) So this is your first time in the market, right?

(ALADD pole-jumps to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE: So, obviously?

ALADDIN: Well, you're right. (She looks at him, looking at him longingly. He returns her gaze.
But he realized he did and he went back to normal.) I mean, you don't know how bad Agrabah can be.
(House sets up a board so he can walk on it, but when he bends over, it flies over his head. He recoils in surprise.
He threw her a stick. ALADDIN and ABU's eyes widen.)

JASMINE: I'm a fast learner.

ALADDIN: That's right. Come here. (They go to the roof, avoiding boards and ledges as they walk.) Huh. Leave your head there . Be careful.

JASMINE: Do you live here?

ALADDIN: Yes. I am with Abumpiki. Come, go as you please.

JASMINE: Very interesting.

ALADDIN: Well, not much (he pulls back the curtain to reveal the palace), but it's a great sight. The palace looks really nice, doesn’t it?

JASMINE: Oh, that’s lovely.

ALADDIN: I wonder what it would be like to live there, with servants and slaves...

JASMINE: That’s good. People tell you where to go and how to dress.

ALADDIN: Much better than this place. You'll have to constantly snipe and avoid guards to get food.

JASMINE: You're not free to make up your own mind.

ALADDIN: Sometimes it does.

JASMINE: You just are.

BOTH: (together) – arrested.

(They get to know each other and realize their perfection. But then ALADDIN finds out where she is and ruins her face.
She takes the apple from ABU's hand and slips her hand into JASMINE's.)

ALADDIN: Well, where are you?

JASMINE: What does that matter? I ran away and didn’t come back.

ALADDIN: Really? How can it be so? (He bites the apple off his hand, then hands it to ABU, who looks annoyed).

ABU: Why are you...!

(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE).

JASMINE: My father is forcing me to marry him.

ALADDIN: It's... horrible. (ABU appears behind the princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!

(ABU runs upstairs, talking and cursing as he goes).

JASMINE: E dun?

ALADDIN: Abu ko... uh... o ma tilen.

ABU: What is that?

JASMINE: Oh, wa?

ALADDIN: Yes, of course.

JASMINE: Well, does Abu have anything else to say?

ALADDIN: Well, he hopes he can do something to help her.

ABU: ¡Ay wayna!

JASMINE: Hmm... tell her she's so... so sweet.

(ALADDIN and JASMINE get even closer until ALADDIN leans over and kisses her. He is stopped by the guards who found him).

ANSWER: There you are!

ALADDIN and JASMINE: They're after me! (to each other) Does yours follow suit?

JASMINE: Maybe my dad sent them...

ALADDIN: Can you believe me?

JASMINE: E dun?

ALADDIN: Can you believe me? (He raises his hand)

JASMINE: He's a snake. (He takes it).

ALADDIN: Then fly!

(They both jump off the roof, and fall down into a pile of salt. They try to escape, but the GUARD stops them from leaving).

GUARD: We keep shooting at each other, right, street dog?

(ABU shoots the guard's turban again, but there are more guards blocking the exit.
The first RUSH cuts off ABU's head and throws it into a vase. Three guards capture ALADDIN.)
- .
ANSWER: This is prison for you, kid.

ALADDIN: Hey!

JASMINE: He has to go.

TIME: (not realizing she's a princess) Look at what you've got here, guys: a pair of street socks. (He falls to the ground).

JASMINE: (stands up and removes the hood of her coat) Princess make the law go!

.

JANK'AKÄWI: Princesa Jasmine, Bamako, Mali.

ALADDIN: A prince?

ABU: (jarroasi) Princess?

FAMANA: What are you doing outside the palace? What's your call ratampixa?

JASMINE: Bana your problem na. Make the Kεli siskε kε. Take him away!

FAMANA: Well, I want to die, princess, my donwaja comes from Jafar. I will share it with him.

(GUARDS lead ALADDIN away, kneeling.)

JASMINE: (looks tired) Yeah, I'll work.

.
He closes the door carefully, but the princess is in a hurry to get in before he can finish. He closes it and stays at IAGO's door.)

JASMINE: Jafar?

JAFAR: Oh, princess.

IAGO: Oh! Jafar, n b'a siri!

JAFAR: How can I help you? (She rubs her clothes to hide the door).

JASMINE: The guards would take the baby to the market at your request.

JAFAR: Your father told me to make peace in Agrabah. The boy was a bad person.

JASMINE: What happened?

IAGO: I can't breathe, Jafar.

JAFAR: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.

IAGO: You just... (JAFAR walks back into the door and closes it) - wow, that's annoying!

JASMINE: He didn't hug me! I was running and running!

JAFAR: (walking in shock) Oh my God! Oh, how sweet it is. I would be a scientist.

JASMINE: What can I do?

JAFAR: By the way, the man's case has already been filed.

JASMINE: Any words?

JAFAR: (sighs) Death. (JASMINE smiles.) She licked her lips.

JASMINE: No! (He falls to the ground).

JAFAR: I'm sorry, princess.

JASMINE: How do you do it? (She screams and runs out of the room).

(IAGO finally makes it through the door. He steps and lands in JAFAR's arms, sighing).

IAGO: How did it go?

JAFAR: I think he's... very interesting. (They both have dark faces).

(Talking to JASMINE at night, crying by the well. RAJAH comes to comfort her. He hugs her).

JASMINE: It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't even know his name.

(Cut to inside the kitchen. The mice jump down and see ALADDIN hanging from the wall).

ALADDIN: (to himself) She's a princess. I don't believe in that. Maybe that seemed silly to him!

ABU: (laughs) Oh-ho! Is it Aladdin? Good morning!

(There is an ABU in the window above the dungeon).

ALADDIN: Abu! Here! Hey, please help me with this.

(ABU gets up, then starts talking wildly, and falls to the ground. He wraps the hat around his head and makes big eyes for the princess to read).

ALADDIN: Hey, he was in trouble. Ah, it’s so good.

(ABU jumps into ALADDIN's arms, takes a small tool from his pocket, and then releases ALADDIN.)

ABU: Jïsa, jïsa, jïsa.

ALADDIN: Bonjour concern, Abou. I will never see him again ye . I am caturotta, remember, ani sigilan ni tila-tila. She must cɛw marry the prince ani dɔ wɛrɛw. He deserves ye .

(ABU finally frees ALADDIN's hands.) Bamako, Mali.

ABU: ¡Ta-da!

ALADDIN: (hieroi ranteitaan) Olen.

OLDER: You ina ch'usat the end'ata if you stop, son.

(We see an old man sitting in the corner, whom ALADDIN and ABU haven't seen yet) Mä jach'a jach'a' done.

ALADDIN: Who are you?

COMMENTARY: A humble prisoner like you. But together, we can do a lot in a little time.

ALADDIN: I'm listening to the sat water.

OLDER: There’s a cave, my boy… a wonderful cave, full of treasures beyond your wildest dreams. Use a little time to do it.

(Listeners will note that CHIQA JAQIN used the word "princess" as "princess" instead of "PRIN-cess".
THE OLDER MAN turns his back on him and IAGO sticks his head out of JAFAR's "old man" mask.) Wali maana jacha jacha' mask.

IAGO: Jafar, huh? I'm dying for this. [yell].

ALADDIN: But the law says, and the vain prince can.

QUESTION: ¿You’ve heard of the golden rule, right? Whoever owns the gold makes rules in a little time. (She smirks and points to the worst mouth.) [ snarling laughter Mä jach' starts'.

ALADDIN: ¿Why qunt'asis would you share all this wonderful wealth with me?

EXPLAIN: I need a young man with at least two legs strong enough to do a ma jacha cha'a.

ALADDIN: Trouble ye bara kɛ. That's it there. We are here for ye .

(VANHA MAN would be the one to work on the pilot.) It’s a great show.

CORNER: Mm-mm-mm. Things are not always the way they are katu. So... are we cutting the deal?

(ALADDIN looks at ABU, shrugs his juk' shoulders.)

ABU: Oh, i t'a dòn.

(Cut to the woods. We see ALADDIN leading a horse, accompanied by the MEN and ABU. Diss., at the Wonder Hills.)

[sɔgɔsɔgɔninjew] .

DUNK: Who disturbs my sleep?

ALADDIN: I'm sorry, Aladdin.

HEART: Let's move on. Do not touch anything but the lamp.

(The pit opens with a slingshot and stairs appear in front of ALADDIN).

LITTLE: Remember, son, bring the lantern first, and you will have your reward.

ALADDIN: And, Abu. (hides ABU under the sleeve of his coat).

[yell] .

(ALADDIN starts down the stairs. Once inside, he enters a golden room full of treasures).

ALADDIN: Do you want to see it?

ABU: [groans] Ohh.

ALADDIN: Those few things could make you richer than the Sultan.

(The ABU watches, sees the property, and then drives away).

ALADDIN: Abu and so on.

[white]

(ABU stops in the middle and falls on the carpet below).

ALADDIN: Don't touch anything. We need to find a lamp.

(They start walking across the room when MATTO gets up from the floor and starts following them. Presumably ABU is following them).

ABU: Sisan wa?

(He turns around and sees MATTO lying on the floor. He continues to follow MATTO again.
ABU spun again, but ALFORMA slammed it and knocked the pile of treasure. (ABU runs towards ALADDIN and pulls his pants leg).

ABU: Aladini, Aladini.

ALADDIN: Abu, can you stop him?

(MAT follows again, but this time ABU turns around and jumps to the other side of the mat.
He lands with a pomp and drops ABU's head. When ABU jumps, CARPET jumps again to the other side.
This time ABU got down to karate. MATO leaned down and grabbed ABU's cloak, then put it on himself.
ABU thought for a moment until MATO pointed at an acorn in front of him. Both ABU and CARPET jump in fear and run.
ABU grabs ALADDIN and turns his head to look at ALFORMA.)

[yell]

ALADDIN: Abu, what is your madness?

(Behind the treasure pile is a carpet).

ALADDIN: The magic carpet. Date. Get out of here. I will not hurt you.

(CARP emerges slowly, nervously, then picks up ABU's cloak and dusts it off. He runs towards ALADDIN and hands the cloak to ABU at his side.
(ABU screams and jumps into ALADDIN's arms).

[yell]

ALADDIN: Hey, don't worry too much, Abu. He doesn't want to bite. THANK YOU.

(CARPET takes ABU's hat again and hands it to him. ABU shrugs and screams. CARPET starts walking away, "sorry.")

[yell] .

ALADDIN: Hello. Wait a minute. Don’t go to the gym. Maybe you can help. (ALFORMA looks back with a smile. She then runs around the couple).
Hey, peace. Look, we're trying to get this lamp. (ALFORMA motions for them to follow her.) I think she knows where she is.

ABU: [sighs with delight] [whispering].

(They pass through a long cave until they emerge into an underground cavern. In the middle of the room is a large pillar with stairs leading up to it.
It is surrounded by water and misplaced stones form a bridge. There is a light at the top of the pillar. ALADDIN begins to cut the bridge.)

ALADDIN: [ chuckles] Wait here.

ABU: [groans] Oh. Or did he see her ? I see!

(ABU sees a temple with a golden monkey. A large ruby ​​on raised legs. ABU collapses in a daze. ALADDIN quickly runs up the stairs.
CARPET sees ABU and grabs his back, trying in vain to stop him. ALADDIN finally gets the TAG LAMP.)

ALADDIN: Is that true? That's why we came here... (Looks down to see ABU running from the MAT to the jewelry.)
Abu! PAYABLE!

(ABU grabs the jewelry. A noise is heard and the room begins to shake).

HEARTBREAK: Infidels!

ABU: That’s a great example.

PUICHAWIN'S WORD: You've touched an irresistible treasure! (ABU put the stone back up, but the stone and temple turned to lava).
From now on, you will never see the light again!

ALADDIN: ¡Waw!

(ALADDIN runs down the stairs, but the vine hits a log, sending him flying down into the air. The water turns to lava.
He fell towards her when suddenly GURSU jumped out and grabbed her. ABU is standing on a rock on the bridge .
He looks left and right and sees rocks melting into lava. Then CARPET runs in and hugs ALADDIN as the last stone explodes.)

ABU: Dɛmɛ, dɛmɛ, dɛmɛ!

ALADDIN: I found you! Wow Matto we go!

(They run together through the cave, avoiding walls and falling debris. ABU holds ALADDIN's head and closes his eyes).

ALADDIN: Abu! Abu, now is not the time for fear! (He shoots ABU out of his head, and sees him flying to the wall.) Start sailing!

[Abu pant] [thunder thunder] [lightning].

(ALFORMA drops down through another hole. Eventually, they emerge through the bottom. Outside, the hole begins to creep shut.
MATO and company are almost on top when a rock falls on the mat and a THX Optimizer clip sends them to the ground.
ALADDIN is tied to the stone wall. It sees NOW, which is short.)

ALADDIN: Help!

NOW: Throw me a flashlight!

ALADDIN: I can't stand it. Give me your hand!

NOW: Give me your lamp first!

(ALADDIN reaches for the CITY LANCHET. He picks it up and raises the WOOD MAN above his head).

JUST: [laughs] Yeah! finally! [turns on the lamp].

[Aladdin is struggling].

(ALADDIN gets out with ABU's help. But the MAN IN QUESTION pushes ABU and grabs ALADDIN's wrist).

ALADDIN: What are you doing?

FACT: I will give you your reward! (JAFAR continues in his normal voice.) Eternal reward. [yell]

(He takes the broken dagger and almost stabs ALADDIN when ABU bites his wrist. He screams but releases ALADDIN, who falls into the ravine.
The small man threw the ABU into the hole. The clip is finished with the THX Optimizer. ALFORNA sees him but he's trapped under a rock.
He tries to escape, and he escapes. He quickly grabs ALADDIN, but he hits the wall several times, knocking him unconscious.
Above, the valley roars for the last time before sinking back into the dust. JAFAR removes his mask.) [screams].

[making a loud noise].

JAFAR: That's mine! It’s all mine! I-- (He doesn't have it in his pocket) Where is it? No! No...!

(The kiss breaks to JASMINE's room. She sits on the couch next to a sad-looking RAJAH. The SULTAN enters).

SULTAN: Jasmina? Oh dear brother. What is the wrong thing?

JASMINE: Jafar... did... something... terrible. (She seems to be crying).

SULTAN: Yeah, there, there my son, we're writing things. Now tell me everything.

(Cut to the bottom of the valley. ALADDIN lies unconscious on top of GUSUN. ABU tries to wake him up.)

ABU: Oh, oh. Is it Aladdin? Develop. Aladdin is a brother.

(TAPIT gets up and picks up ALADDIN. He gets up slowly).

ALADDIN: Oh my head. (He looks through the closed door.) We're stuck. (Annoyed, sticking his finger in the door) That two-faced jacket!
(Reassuringly) Who carried that lantern so long ago.

ABU: Jesus!

(ABU takes the MAGIC LAMP)

ALADDIN: Good morning! Well, you little furry son! It's like ugly, useless scrap metal.
Hello, I think it's written here, but it's hard to understand.

(He turns on the LAMP. Smoke suddenly appears in the hole, and the LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN clings to the lamp, our dear, .
GENIUS was released.)

GENIE: Aaaaahhhhh! Oh! Ten thousand years is such a pain in your neck! (He impales ALADDIN on a nearby rock.
He walks around shouting, shaking his head. MATTO casts ALADDIN.)
Wow! Is it right to be outside! (GENIE uses his last flashlight as a microphone).
It’s nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hi, where are you from? (Puts microphone in ALADDIN'S face.) What's your name?

ALADDIN: Uh, al--uh--Aladdin: Bamako, Mali.

GENIUS: (says his name even though he's got something important) Aladdin! (The neon sign ALADDIN glows with the effect of lights around it.
The character changes to show GENIUS on the next line.) Hello, Aladdin. It’s great to have you on the show. Can we call you “Ali”? » Or maybe "Where?" »
Or how about "Laddi"? (The GENIE disappears, and a dog covered in a blanket enters.) They would say, "Here, boy!" Come on, Laddi!

ALADDIN: (shakes his head) I've hit my head harder than I expected.

GENIE: (A bɛ wulu la hali bi) I bɛ sigarɛti min wa? Yala i bɛna bɔnɛ i la ni ne y’o kɛ wa? (Usi bɛ wuluwulu sisi la, o kɔfɛ a bɛ segin ka taa GENIUS la. ABU bɛ sɔgɔsɔgɔ ni kanba ye).
Oh, sorry Cheetah, n jigi b'a kan ko n ma n furu jeni! Bonjour Rugman! Ne ma i ye kabini san ba damadɔ! O pompom di n ma!
Hee! Ni! (ALFORMA dɔ bolila ka na NERO fo. NERO ye ALADDIN filɛ.) A fɔ, i ka dɔgɔ ni ne makɛ laban ye.
(A b’a ka biyɛri kɔnɔbara kɔrɔta.) O walima ne ka fasa. Sideways look: Yala ne ɲɛda cogoya tɛ kelen ye i fɛ wa?

ALADDIN: A' ye miniti kelen jira! Ne ye... i ka matigi ye wa?

GENIE: (putting the diploma in ALADDIN's hands and placing a grenade over his head.) That's right! We can read it!!
Why do you want me, (like Arnold Schwarzenegger) always surprising, (on the blog) long content, (with a ventriloquist doll)
studied many times, (pulls dummy aside) but never duplicated -- (Grows more GENE around.) DUP.

GENIUS: Duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate.

GENIUS: (Speaking like a ring announcer in boxing.) Lamp genius! (Enter Ed Sullivan) Here, right under the lamp, .
here to have fun and satisfy your needs . THANK YOU!

ALADDIN: Wow! Do you want to be fulfilled?

GENIUS: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-no more to wish. (The slot machine turns into a slot machine, the ball drops and three Genies appear from the windows).
That’s it: three. (Three GENIE warriors leave the scene.) One, two, three. (Exchanges ab/w Groucho Marx.) No exchanges, exchanges or refunds.
(Duck translates the mystery word "Reimbursements".

ALADDIN: (to ABU) Now I know I dreamed.

Genie: Master, I don't think you really understand what we have here! So why not just imagine, if you are shining in your possibilities.
[Nero] .
Well, Ali Baba had forty thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand stories
But use your talent, because you've got your work cut out for you
You have a magic that never fails!
(GENIE made 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords. GENIUS showed up in a jacket, raising his hand to subdue the thieves).

[Nero] .
Now you have power in your corner
There is some great ammo in your camp
You punch, spice, yahoo and whatever
You see, all you have to do is turn off this lamp
And I said, 'I'll tell.'
(A boxing ring appears, in ALADD's corner, and the GENIUS hits it. Then the GENIUS turns into a fireball and explodes, killing one of our heroes.
Then the GENIUS came out from under the lamp and took ALADDIN's hand and shook the lamp.)

[Nero] .
Nanny Aladdin, the ladonbaga
What is your happiness?
I would like to take your order, please write
You've never had a friend like me
No, no, no, no!
(GENIE arranges tables and chairs, then writes things down in a notebook, like a chef).

[Nero] .
Life is your kitchen and I am your master!
Come and ask what you want
You've never had a friend like me.
(GENIE appears as a meat dish, then returns to its normal form, but raises its ears to hear ALADDIN. Eventually transforms into four wise twins).

[Nero] .
Yes sir we take pride in our work
You are the head, the king, the shah!
What you want to say is yours!
A real plate How about some Baklava?
(The Gens give him a haircut, a haircut and a haircut, and ALADDIN emerges from a comfortable chair (eh?), surrounded by wealth and adored by women.
GENIUS appears and fills the screen with baklava.)

[Nero] .
Look at a short "A" column.
Test the entire "B" group.
I want to help you man
You've never had a friend like me
(ALADDIN climbs the food column with a big A at the top, and then jumps to another hill with a B at the top.
He falls and gets caught in the railing GENIE holds. He opens his mouth and makes a smile.
A little NERO appears dressed as a magician. Mini GENIE does a little dance with both fingers.
Eventually, they surround the minigen and destroy it.)

[Nero] .
Can your friends do that?
Do your friends do that?
Would your friends pull this off in a tiny outfit?
Your friends can go crazy!
Well, here it is
Can your friends go to Abracadabra, let them rip
And then losing this crap?
(NERO nods, copies, then juggles.
They threw ALADDIN, who is dangling with one arm, and one end rolled in his hand like a basket.
He pokes his head into NERO, who tries to climb out of his base costume.
It moves around in a circle until it becomes a white swan. The rabbit turns into a brown snake (very reminiscent of Figment at EPCOT Center).
The snake breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM Girls dancing around ALADDIN. Once you start having fun with them, they disappear).

[Nero] .
So don’t just sit there, snoring, empty
I am here to answer every midday prayer
You got it kindly, proof
Are you a strategic thinker? matter!
I would love to help you
So I really want to know what you want
You definitely have a wish three miles away
So just scratch it, and oh!
(GENIE is like an entity called ALADDIN, turning it into a witness that surrounds and surrounds ALADDIN.
NERO takes a list {written in Arabic} from ALADDIN's ear, with which he sniffs dry after washing it.)

[Nero] .
Mr. Aladdin, sir, I want two or three
I'm hiring, big mogul
You never, ever have a friend
You never, ever have a friend
He's never had... a friend... like me!
You've never had a friend like me!
(HAREM The dancing girls reappear, and ALADDIN leans in for a kiss. He turns into NERO, who brings in four dancing monsters.
On the other hand it blows on four dancing camels, followed by a great background dance number, with our heroes dancing.
ABU grabs as much gold as he can, but GENIE wraps it all up in the rainstorm and washes it all back into the valley.
GENIE has a neon "APLAUSE" logo on her back. ABU returned his cloak and saw that it was empty.)

GENIE: What will happen, Sir?

ALADDIN: You give me three wishes?

GENIE: (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost. A few reservations, a few thoughts

ALADDIN: How is it?

GENIE: Ah, first rule: You can't kill anyone. (He pats her head with his hand.) Well, don't ask.
Rule number two: You can’t make one person fall in love with another. (The head becomes a giant double mouth kissing ALADDIN.)
Small penalty area. (He falls asleep naked, then wakes up as a zombie.) Third rule: I cannot raise people from the dead.
Not a good picture, (Grabs ALADDIN and shakes him) Not good for me! (It's back to normal.) Otherwise, there it is!

ALADDIN: (looking at ABU as if making a decision) Ah, reservations? You mean boundaries? according to their desires ?
(to ABU) Some omnipotent beings cannot bring people back to life. I don't know, Abu. He probably won't get us out of that hole.
Looks like we need to find a way out here…

(They start to move, but a giant foot moves in front of them).

GENIE: Excuse me? Are you looking at me? Are you hitting my lamp? Will you wake me up, and bring me here? And thank you Petit me?

(MATTO and the passengers like to run away from the desert dust. The Sultan leaves the room.
JAFAR gets IAGO, JASMINE and SULTAN chicks.)

SULTAN: Jafar, this is a scandal. Janitï Taqi kunas the heat is done by using

JAFAR: My apologies, King. (Jamp'att' jane holds his hand, bɛnkansεbεn jε takes it off).

JASMINE: If he's someone to be questioned. When I am queen, I have sεbεnεj power away from you.

SULTAN: For the sake of it. everything comes to a conclusion. person, Jasmine, this pretender thing u returns, (he's fathering and Jasmine is out uki)
¿Jasmine's wife? Muscle Jasmine! (He runs after you).

JAFAR: I wish I had that lamp!

IAGO: (JASMINE) Powerful enough to have you! I see!
We think we can keep kissing this idiot and his stupid daughter for the rest of our lives…

JAFAR: No, Iago. Just find an idiot guy. Then they'll throw us out... or behead us!

MOLEMAT: ¡Eeewww!

IAGO: (thinking) Oh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Is that Jafar? What if you were a naughty guy?

JAFAR: (Looking down at IAGO) What?

IAGO: Well, you're going to marry a princess, all right? So you became the Sultan!

JAFAR: Ah! To marry a mosquito? I will be the Sultan. Ideas are merit!

IAGO: Yes, that's enough! Than! And then we stoned the little father and mother! (Feed bombs on the floor) Kersplat!

JAFAR: Iago, I love how your dirty little mind works!

(They both laugh as they walk to an oasis in the desert where the WORM lands.)

GENIUS: (Flight attendant) Thank you for choosing the Magic Carpet for all your travel desires. Do not stop until the step stops.
(As ALADDIN and ABU descend the stairs made by ALFORMA) Thank you. Good bye! THANK YOU! Bye! (Return to Normal)
Not right now. And that, Mr. Mustafa, who doubts?

ALADDIN: Oh, you showed me that right. Now for my three wishes - .

GENIUS: Are my ears deceiving me? Three? You are ONE, baby!

ALADDIN: Ah, no, I never really wanted to leave that club. You are the only one who has done that.

(GENIE thinks for a moment, then her jaw cracks. She turns into a sheep).

GENIE: Well, wasn't I bound? Okay, baaaaad boy, but no more gifts.

ALADDIN: A fair plan. Three wishes, by the way. I wish them success. (GENIUS) What do you want to do?

(GENIE hangs like a hammock between two trees).

GENIE: Is it me? Nobody's ever asked me that before. So, for me, ah, forget it.

ALADDIN: Why? Don’t tell me that.

GENIUS: Freedom .

ALADDIN: Are you a prisoner?

GENIUS: Everything is part and parcel, every concert of genius. (He becomes a giant, voice resonates) Phenomenal cosmic powers!
(Shrink, narrow TAIL LAMP.) Salon fitinin

ALADDIN: Genius, that's awful.

GENIE: (From the lamp) But oh... to be free. Saying "whoah! What do you want? pooh! What do you want? pooh! What do you want?"
To be my own master would surpass all the magic and wealth in the world! But what am I talking about here?
Let’s get real here. THAT IS NOT IT. Genius, yesterday smelling of hummus.

ALADDIN: Why not?

GENIE: The only thing that depends is if my master wants to go. So you can imagine how many times this has happened.

ALADDIN: I'm sorry. I will save you.

GENIUS: (Her head falls into Pinocchio's with a frown) Um, that's right. Yell!

ALADDIN: Not really, I promise. (He pulls his nose back and Genie regains consciousness).
After doing my first two desires, I will save you with my third desire. (He raises his hand)

GENIE: Well, I hope so. (He shakes hands with ALADDIN.) Very nice. Let’s do some magic. (He becomes a mage.) So what? What more do you want?

ALADDIN: Ayiwa, I'm going to hug you.

GENIUS: Ehhh! (Like a candle, and the Genie's chest shows a heart with a cross in it.) Bad. I can't make anyone fall in love, remember?

ALADDIN: Oh, but, Genie, he's so smart and funny and.

GENIUS: Beautiful?

ALADDIN: Very interesting. He’s got these eyes… and this hair. Wow. And her smile… [sigh].

GENIUS: (Sitting with ABU and MATO in a Paris cafe.) Friend. It’s very interesting.

ALADDIN: But she's a princess. Or for a chance I'll... Hey, can you make me king?

GENIE: Look here. ("The King's Cookbook.") Sogo a la rey? (He crowns a meat) No, the King Crab of Alaska.
(She snaps her fingers and sees SEBASTIAN crushing the crab "The Little Mermaid.") Ouch. I hate it when they do that. Caesar's salad? Ah!
(A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et Tu, Brute? No. Aha. "Make a king." (He looks at ALADDIN slyly.) Is this the wish of the power? You have to say the words.

ALADDIN: Genie, I want to make you king!

GENIE: Very interesting! ¡That’s a huge thing! (He has square shoulders, looks like Arsenio Hall. Then he became a clothing designer/fashion designer.)
First, this connection between Fez and Vest is still in the third century . These places – what can we say – pray? No! Let's work with me here.
(He takes Aladdin's measurements, waving his arms, and ALADDIN puts on his royal robes.) I like him, very macho! Now I want something else.
What does that tell me? It’s about transportation. Sorry, monkey boy! So, here!

(ABU tries to cover it with ALFORMA, but GENIE grabs it and escapes).

RESULTS: Alas!

GENIE: Here he comes (ALADDIN and GENIE on the set of a game show, ALADDIN standing on a podium labeled "AL".)
And what better way than with one of your new camels!
Take care, and dance! (The door opens with the Genie's head, where ABU turns into a camel. He spits out a path next to his mouth.
But Genie doesn't know.) Mmm, not necessarily. (She nods and ABU turns into a beautiful white pony.) Very messy. Wait and see. What do you have to do?
(GENIUS nodded several times and changed ABU: duck, ostrich, turtle, and a '57 Cadillac named "ABU 1".
(That's speculation, I don't know the car, but judging by the ribs I can't say. Eventually it went back to normal).
Than!! Esalalumbo, Shimin Dumbo, and others! Wow!! (And with the key spell, Dumbo ABU turns into a monster.
CARPET is struggling to get rid of the ABU (46ft.) width, speaking of trunk space, check out this move!

(ABU sees the light in the pool and jumps into a tree.
The tree falls to the ground in its form where ABU grabs it and looks up at ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Abu, you are very sweet.

GENIUS: He’s got a costume, he’s got a beast, but we’re not done yet. Hold on to your turban, kid, because we're going to make you a star!

(We slowly zoom to a distant oasis, as fireworks begin to explode outside. Cut to a pile of toys. (Find the WORKS here.)
We kneel and SULTAN balances them. at the end he balances well, then settles down and smiles.
However, JAFAR barges in and the battery fails.)

JAFAR: Sir, I have found a solution to your daughter’s problem.

IAGO: Oh! There is a problem with your daughter!

SULTAN: Oh, really?

JAFAR: (open his mouth) Here. "If the princess does not choose a husband at the appointed time, the sultan will choose a husband for her."

SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all suitors! (He tries to put the cookie in Iago's mouth. IAGO backs away. The SULTAN takes the cookie confused).
How can I choose someone who hates it? (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN immediately puts a biscuit in his mouth).

JAFAR: Don't worry, sir. There is something more. Until a suitable prince is found, the princess must marry… hmm… interesting.

SULTAN: Are we there? JOHN?

JAFAR: Visor King! Well, that might be… for me!

SULTAN: Well, I think the law says that only a king can marry a princess, I'm pretty sure.

JAFAR: Times of crisis require decisive measures, sir. (He pulls out a stick and hypnotizes the SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...

JAFAR: You ordered the princess to marry me.

SULTAN: I... order... princess...... (breaks the spell momentarily)... but you are too old!

JAFAR: (approaches the stick) The princess will marry me!

SULTAN: The princess is about to be married... (the sobs break again, this time to a fanfare of "Prince Ali" trumpets.)
What? What is this? This song is so good! Hahaha. Jafar, you have to come and see this!

(We see a parade proceeding in the form of the GREAT GENIUS in human form).

STORIES: Tell Prince Ali!

NEW: Hello! That’s Prince Ali!

LARGE: Oh, through the old bazaar, Oh oh, let us pass, that bright new star, Oh, come, catch his eye for the first time in your neighborhood!
Make way, he is here, ringing the bells, beating the drum. You will love this guy

GENIUS: (replacing ETHEL MERMAN)

GIRL: (contraction, hearts pounding) .

Prince Ali, the beautiful Ali Ababwa There is no doubt that this Ali is very popular
This physics, manner of speech Never clear, never boring Strong knees
Everything about this guy is fascinating. Well, get out of there. He’s amazing, he’s smart, he’s wonderful. Adjust your sails and get ready.
It will break my heart To watch Prince Ali crawl and watch! And I love her outfit!

(JASMINE looks out from the palace balcony.

CHORUS: He's got 95 white Persian monkeys!

(Monkeys want it, see Monkeys!)

And it costs nothing to maintain them!

(He’s generous, by the way)

He has slaves, slaves and helpers!

(It’s an honor to serve him)

They bow to his whims and want to serve him

They are just dogs about their loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali it is!

(ALADDIN throws a hurried mass of gold coins. ABU, ALADDIN, and the walkers climb onto the steps of the palace.
The SULTAN runs to the door of the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door.
He suddenly opens the door, led by ABU and ALADDIN, and destroys JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)

CHORUS and GENIUS: Prince Ali, love him! Ali Dogs is a fisa!

GENIE: I hear your princess is a lovely sight!

And so, folks,

He got dressed and left

CORPS: 60 lions, llamas galore

Oso b'a la, lionai

The marching band

with 40 fakirs , cooks and bakers

Their stomachs screaming on one side

Make way for Prince Ali!

(More excitement follows as ALADDIN runs behind ABU into the MAGIC ARFORM and runs towards the SULTAN. JAFAR closes the door.)

SULTAN: (applause) It’s amazing, really nice.

ALADDIN: (draws a deep voice.) Ahem. Your Lordship, I have come from far away to seek your daughter’s hand.

SULTAN: Prince Ali's Dogs! Very. Nice to meet you. (She rushes over and takes ALI's hand.) This is my prince's visor, Jafar. He is also excited.

JAFAR: (Very dry) Ecstatic. I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...

ALADDIN: --A few!

JAFAR: That's nothing. ADEQUATE. Don’t just roll here uninvited and wait…

SULTAN: ...Allah, this is truly a miraculous device. (He drops his pom poms, they pull out his mustache.) I don't think I'll do that.

ALADDIN: Of course, your majesty. I can.

(She helps SULTANI to ALFORMA and drops her. JAFAR pins ALFORMA down with a cane.)

JAFAR: Sir, I advise you not to.

SULTANI: -- You pushed the button, Jafar. Learn to have some fun.

(She waves the pole and the WORM and SULTAN flee. IAGO, who was standing at the end of the pole, falls,
scratch the rod with its elbow every now and then as it goes down.
SULTAN and CARPET jump higher and higher and attack with a bomb, running into ABU, scaring it off.
The race continues in the background, with JAFAR and ALI in the foreground speaking.)

JAFAR: He will do mine?

ALADDIN: Oh, i ye teliya, ne dalen b'a la. (A bɛ nisɔndiya. JAFAR tɛ o kɛ).

JAFAR: N b'i deli ka n'a lajɛ. (Iago bɛ jigin bere kan).

SULTAN: A filɛ, Polly!

(Bɛɛ bɛ segin kɔ waati kɔnɔ ni WORM bɛ fiyɛ santimɛtɛrɛ damadɔ u kun sanfɛ. WORM bɛ segin ka SULTAN tugu IAGO nɔfɛ ka so lamini).

SULTAN: Off, n bè jigin. Jafar, nin filɛ! (A bɛ jigin).

JAFAR: A ka di kosɛbɛ, I ka Matigi.

SULTAN: Oh, very strange. Yes, there seems to be a gift for it. (ALFORMA frantically walks towards ABU, then collapses. ABU grabs her).
This guy is awesome. And the king too. (mocks JAFAR) If we're lucky, we won't marry Jasmine after all.

JAFAR: I'm not sure, sir.

SULTAN: This is absurd. One of the things I am proud of as Jafar is that I am a very good judge of character.

IAGO: Oh, good judge, yes, of course... no!!!

(JASMINE enters quietly).

SULTAN: Jasmine likes this!

ALADDIN: And I'm already in love with princess Jasmine!

JAFAR: Your Lordship. I have to mention Jasmine. (JASMINE Angry.) This boy is no different.
What makes her think she's right for a princess?

ALADDIN: Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He kicks JAFAR's goat tail, which is firing in all directions).
Let him meet me. I will win your daughter!

JASMINE: How dare you! (Everyone looks shocked.) Are you here to celebrate the future? I won't get an answer! (He runs out).

SULTANI: Oh my Goddess. Don’t worry, Prince Ali. Give Jasmine time to calm down. (They left).

JAFAR: I think it is time to say goodbye to Prince Abooboo.

(JaSMINE and I talk on the balcony at night. We turn to find ALADDIN and company in the courtyard).

ALADDIN: What should I do? Jasmine won't even let me talk to her. I must know that I cannot fulfill the wishes of these foolish princes.
(ABU struggles to open the banana with his watch case. He breaks it, and the banana flies into his eyes.
Then he threw a banana peel into the same pile.)

GENIE: (on carpet, playing chess) So! (ALFORMA does the same, throwing the blue line off the board.) Hello. That’s a good idea. (Rodney Dangerfield).
I can't believe I'm losing all-in.

ALADDIN: Genius, I need help.

GENIE: (As Jack Nicholson) Well, Sparky, here's the deal. You want to clean the little woman, you have to be a straight shooter, follow me?

ALADDIN: Where are we?

GENIE: (Reverts to normal, holding grenade launcher. Points to words on board) Tell him... RIGHT!!!

ALADDIN: That's not it! If Jasmine knew I was actually a dirty street dog, she'd laugh at me. (He's wearing a dress, which shines like a GENIUS).

GENIUS: A woman appreciates a man who makes her happy! (ALADDIN takes off the chain and lights the lamps. The GENIUS comes out with his right hair).
Al, as an aside, you really need to behave.

ALADDIN: Hey, that's the last thing. Well, I'm going to see him. I have to be gentle, fierce, and brave. How are you doing?

GENIE: (Sadly) Like a king.

(ALADDIN runs to the balcony on the CARPET. JASMINE is in bed, crying. RAJAH is beside her).

ALADDIN: (Jan wali jaya) ¿Princesa Jasmine?

(RAJAH looks up and sighs).

JASMINE: Is anyone there?

ALADDIN: Hello, Prince Ali. Ahem--(He jumped into his deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.

JASMINE: I don't want to see you.

ALADDIN: No, no, please, princess. Give me a chance.

(RAJAH smirks and approaches him).

JASMINE: A’ ye n’ to yen.

ALADDIN: I'm sorry!

(On the other side of the balcony is ALFORMA below and GENIE below).

GENIE: How about our little friend?

(ALFORMA crosses her throat with her hand).

ALADDIN: Come on, good cat, take her away. The kid down to the bottom . (He removes the turban and dismisses the RAJAH).

JASMINE: (Looks at him, considering his expression.) Wait, wait. Do I know you guys?

ALADDIN: (changes quickly) No, no.

JASMINE: You remind me of the guy I met at the market.

ALADDIN: The market? (A bee dances round its head.) I have servants who go to market for me.
Why do I have employees that go to market for my employees, so the person I’m talking to can’t be me.

JASMINE: (with a sad face) No, I don't think so.

BEE: (to NERO) Enough for you, Casanova. Let's talk about it! She’s smart, she’s funny, her hair, her eyes. What: choose something!

ALADDIN: Oh, Princess Jasmine? You are still there.

BEE: Lovely, great, amazing, spot on!

ALADDIN: Of course!

JASMINE: On time?

BEE: That’s right.

ALADDIN: Wali jach'awa.

BEE: Good treatment.

JASMINE: That’s a little bit. I'm rich, you know.

ALADDIN: Oh my!

JASMINE: Sultan's daughter.

ALADDIN: It was her poem.

JASMINE: A great asset for any royal wedding.

ALADDIN: That's right. ADEQUATE. A king like me.

BEE: (whispering in his ear) Be careful! Communication!

JASMINE: That's right, a prince like you. And I greeted everyone with a nice, sassy, ​​peacock dress!

ABJE: (Fires again, puts on glasses and falls) Mayday! Help!

JASMINE: Go jump off the balcony! (He gets up and leaves) .

ALADDIN: Where are we?

BEE: Stop it! Stop it, please! Do you want to push it?

ALADDIN: (Knocking bee) Wrong!

BEE: Well, good. But remember: just be yourself! (They turned the bee)

ALADDIN: Yes, of course!

JASMIN: Why!?

ALADDIN: Er, you're right. You don't get paid (He seems disappointed).
You have the freedom to make your own choice. JASMINE and RAJAH look at each other in confusion.) I want to go now. (He goes up and down the hill).

JASMINE: No!

ALADDIN: (shakes his head) What? What?

JASMINE: (Surprised) How -- how do you do that? (He looks up to see an ALFORMA).

ALADDIN: The flying carpet.

JASMINE: That’s great. (MATO holds Jasmine with a pompom in her hand).

ALADDIN: You, uh, you don't want to take one, do you? We can see the world from the palace.

JASMINE: Isn't it dangerous?

ALADDIN: Of course. Can you trust me?

JASMINE: (Looking up at him at this very important statement) What?

ALADDIN: (Raising his hand as before) Do you believe me?

JASMINE: (leaks a smile) Yeah.

(He grabs her arm and climbs onto the SHELF. He zooms up and knocks them both down.
"A Whole New World" music plays. JASMINE turns to see RAJAH looking at her curiously.
He smiles as he runs over the palace wall into the sky.)

ALADDIN: I can show you the world Brilliant, brilliant, wonderful. Princess, when was the last time you let your heart decide?

(ALFORMA zooms through the village, pausing to pick up a bunch of flowers. She hands them to ALADDIN, who hands them to JASMINE. Smiles).
Can I close your eyes Ask me On, side and under the flying carpet

(ALFORMA pretends to sing ALADDIN before lifting the clouds.) New world!
A fantastic new perspective No one is going to say no or tell us where to go Or tell us we're just dreaming

(SMILE He looks behind him and sees how Agrabah can't see him. SMILE flies into the clouds and leaves).

JASMINE: New World A dazzling place I never knew. But if you're up there, you're obviously in a whole new world with you now!

ALADDIN: I'm in a new world with you now!

(Each holds a small cloud as the WORM continues to fly. It then moves around the pile of clouds, forming a circle).

JASMINE: Stunning views of the eternal diamond sky, pride, honor, the unspoken feeling of awakening freedom

(They join a flock of birds in the sky. One of them looks very frightened and screams.
CARPET does somersaults and flips, sometimes sending ALADDIN and JASMINE into free fall just to catch them.
Then they zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits).

JASMINE: A whole new world!

ALADDIN: Don't you dare open your eyes

JASMINE: There are a hundred thousand different things to see

ALADDIN: Hold your breath, it'll be all right!

JASMINE: I'm like snow, I've come so far, I can't go back to where I was!

(They are floating on a river, apparently the Nile, because behind the ship are the Great Pyramids.
They thank the worker who raises every eye of the snowflake. It's funny, but you cut too hard and break his nose.)

ALADDIN: A new world!

JASMINE: The whole tour is amazing

ALADDIN: A new horizon must follow

JASMINE: There minute, red words

(They run towards the fleeing wild animals. JASMINE waves at one of them).

BOTH: I follow them somewhere. It’s a free world Let me share this whole new world with you. A whole new world We exist

(On their way to Greece, ALADDIN picks up an apple from the tree and waves it in his hand towards JASMINE,
(who now knows he's dealing with ALADDIN, not Prince ALI.)

ALADDIN: That's funny

JASMINE: Great place

PANI: Me and you!

(ALFORMA floats above the ocean and we see moonlight in the ocean.
Fireworks explode and we celebrate Chinese New Year for a couple living on the roof.)

JASMINE: It’s so weird.

ALADDIN: Yes.

JASMINE: (looking at him) It's too bad Abu had to miss this.

ALADDIN: No, he hates fireworks. (ALFORMA looks up, realizing what's happening.) He doesn't want to fly.
(And now ALADDIN understands) It's... oh no!

JASMINE: (removes her hat) You kind of boy! I know that's it. Why did you lie to me?

ALADDIN: Jasmine, n b'a fò.

JASMINE: You thought I was stupid?

ALADDIN: Yes!

JASMINE: I think, ot?

ALADDIN: No, I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't. No, I don't mean that.

JASMIN: Who are you? Tell the truth!

ALADDIN: Really? (looks at ALFORMA, who gestures on, hopelessly lost).
The truth is, uh... the truth is, sometimes you dress like a commoner to escape the stresses of palace life. (MATO is destroyed by failure.)
But of course I am a king! (Something from his hat falls into his eyes).

JASMINE: Why didn't you see ofn?

ALADDIN: Well, you know, uh... the kingdom goes to town in a costume, which looks kind of strange, doesn't it?

JASMINE: It doesn’t.

(He picks up his pen and brings it closer. MATO places a pom-pom under his "chin" making his face mysterious.
Outside darkening. from the palace balcony where ALADDIN and JASMINE return. ALFORMA climbs down the stairs.
Then ALADDIN lands under the balcony.)

JASMINE: Good night, beautiful prince.

ALADDIN: Sleep well, princess.

(They slowly lean forward for the kiss, but MATO leans in and they kiss faster than expected.
He walked slowly towards her. Finally, he enters the room through the curtain.)

ALADDIN: Yes! (He lands on the carpet, which lands on the floor.) For the first time in my life, things begin to move forward.

(Jasmine turns towards her porch and is held by four arms).

ALADDIN: Good morning! What? (A gag is wrapped around his mouth. Silent voice) Abu! Abu! (We see a monster tied to a leash hanging from a tree).

ABU: Jesus?

NOTE: Hold your breath!

(They wear chains on their legs and arms. Another WARNING ties them to the ARFORMA tree.)

JAFAR: I'm afraid you wear your welcome, Prince Abooboo. (It doesn't exist.) Try never to find it.

(A GUARD hits him in the head and he falls unconscious. Cuts to a cliff where the GUARDS laugh and Aladdin's body falls into the water.
He remembers it now, but his foot is stuck in a rock. The stone hits the bottom of the pond, then the turban drops and the lantern falls.
He sees it, and tries to move the lamp. However, he lost consciousness and fell to the ground.
Worried about his movements, the lantern twitches and clings to his fingers. He shakes it and GENIUS comes out with a bathtub, a rubber ducky and a shower cap.)

GENIUS: Never fail. Take a shower and wipe the lamp. (duck quack) Hi. (See THERE IS NO ALADDIN)
Al? Al! Little one, don’t be discouraged! You can’t fake this! I can't help you with ita f.
You have to say, "Genius, I want to save my life." Did I get that? Light. Go for Aladdin!! (takes ALADDIN in his arms and shakes him.
His head rises and then falls.) I like that. (Head turns into a mermaid.) Wooga! Wow! (Transformed into a deeper ship).
Getting to the right place! (Laughs at the sound of it being German. A stream of water gushes out from the ground and cascades down the rock.
ALADDIN wakes up and spits water out of his lungs.) Don't scare me like that!

ALADDIN: Genie, I--uh, I-uh... (He can't say it, so they kiss.) Thank you, Genie.

GENIUS: Oh Al. I'm starting to like you, boy. I don't have to suggest curtains or anything.

(Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing her hair. SULTANI appears through the double doors, hypnotized).

SULTANI: Jasmine!

JASMINE: Oh dad, I just had an amazing time. I am so happy to be here.

SULTAN: (Very monotone under hypnosis) You must be, Jasmine. I have chosen a man for you.

JASMINE: E dun?

SULTAN: (Another door opens to reveal JAFAR.) You marry Jafar.

(JASMINE smiles at that).

JAFAR: You're speechless, I see. There is a great quality in a woman.

JASMINE: I'll never marry you. (He goes to the SULTAN) Sir, I have chosen Prince Ali!

JAFAR: There is no Prince Ali!

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in front of the balcony door).

ALADDIN: Better read your crystal again, Jafar!

JASMINE: Prince Ali ye!

(JAFAR smiles at ALADDIN).

IAGO: How the hell... (back to the parrot)... uh, awk!

ALADDIN: Tell them the truth, Jafar. You're gonna kill me!

JAFAR: What is that? (He walks towards the SULTAN) This is ridiculous, Your Highness. He is obviously lying. (He brings the stick close to the SULTAN's face.)

SULTAN: He seems... lying.

(ALADDIN sees the wand with glittering eyes).

JASMINE: Dad, what's wrong with you?

ALADDIN: I'm looking for you!

(ALADDIN grabs the staff and knocks it down. JAFAR jumps and breaks the spell forever).

SULTAN: ¡Ay, ay, ay, ¡Diosaja!

ALADDIN: Your Lordship, Jafar uses you for this! (Brings stick forward) .

SULTAN: Why? Is it Jafar?! You are a traitor!

(Three people lead JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Your Majesty, all this can be explained.

SULTAN: ¡Guardanaka! ¡Guardanaka!

IAGO: Well, that's all, we're dead, forget it. Just dig a grave for them both. They were already dead.

(But JAFAR sees the flashlight in ALADDIN's pocket. He turns, but is caught by the guards).

SULTAN: Arrest Jafar immediately.

JAFAR: Not yet, baby!

(JAFAR pulls out a bottle from his pocket. ALADDIN sees it and runs towards it, but JAFAR throws it to the ground.
A thick red cloud appears. If he goes, so does JAFAR.)

SULTAN: Ask for it! Look for it everywhere!

ALADDIN: Jasmine, are you all right?

JASMINE: He's a snake.

(They sit down for a kiss, but SULTANI comes between them).

SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted advisor, has been planning for me all this time. It’s just awful. How can I ever - .
(He stops mid-sentence and looks at the two men.) Is that true? Has my daughter finally chosen a mate?
(She shakes her head) Ha ha! Praise be to Allah! You're a very smart man, I can kiss you! Don't... leave it to me... You got married at the same time!
The Snake The Snake. And you will be happy and prosperous, and then my son, you will be a Sultan!

ALADDIN: The Sultan?

SULTAN: Yes, a true youth like you, with perfect conduct, is indeed what this kingdom needs!
(ALADDIN looks sad).

(Cut to JAFAR's room. JAFAR and IAGO enter.)

IAGO: We have to get out of here! We... I have to start packing, Your Lordship. Just the things that need to be done (IAGO starts throwing things out of the cage.
JAFAR smiles brightly.) Travel light! Bring a gun, a pistol, a knife (he turns to take a picture of her and JAFAR) and what do you think of this picture?
I don't know, I think I make a weird face. (JAFAR starts laughing hard.) Oh boy, it cracked. He was going crazy.
(IAGO walks up to him and pats him on the head.) Jafar! Jafar is a country! Wait! (JAFAR catches him by the throat) Good catch!

JAFAR: Prince Ali is no such dirty man, Aladdin! He has a lamp, Iago.

IAGO: Mun na a tea.

JAFAR: But you can get away with it!

Iago: Me, right?

(Cut to outside the palace. ALADDIN is looking out over the gardens).

ALADDIN: The Sultan? Do they want me to be their sultan?

(GENIE comes out of the lamp)

GENIUS: Huzzah! Congratulations to the conquering hero! (Turns into a one-man orchestra. Sees ALADDIN going down.
He stops, shakes his head, has an idea, and then approaches ALADDIN.
He holds up his hands like a director just framing a movie and we watch.)
Aladdin is great! You have just won the heart of a princess. What will you do next?
(ALADDIN looks at him and sadly goes to bed, where he collapses and weeps. The GENIUS goes unconscious again,
then proceeded to publish a paper, entitled "Aladdin." Thank you :) Psst. Your words: "I produce wisdom." Whenever.

ALADDIN: Genius... N t'a fè.

GENIE: Of course you do. You just say, “Geeeenie, I want you to be free. » (Holds ALADDIN's head and turns him into a ventriloquist dummy."
ALADDIN is far away.)
ALADDIN: I think so! I mean, I really mean it. But they wanted to make me the Sultan... no! They want to be like Prince Ali Sultan. If you are not I am Aladdin.

GENIE: Al, you win!

ALADDIN: For you! The only reason people think I'm special is because of you! What if they find out I'm not really king?
(Calmly) What if Jasmine finds out? i'm losing it. Genius, I can't do this alone! I...I don't want to get rid of you.

GENIE: (mockingly) Well, I see. Of course, I lied to everyone.
Hey, I'm starting to feel left out. Now if you'll excuse me, sir... (The last word is uttered in disgust, then he turns back to the lantern).

(ABU and CARPET look out the window).

ABU: Ohh yeah.

ALADDIN: Genie, I'm sorry. (The tongue comes out of the neck and raspberries.) Good, good!
(He covers the LAMP with a pillow.) So... hang on! (Looking at ABU and ALFORMA.) What are you looking at?
(They both leave.) Listen, I'm... I'm sorry... A-Abu, I'm sorry. I'm not... waiting. Date! (Laughs.) What did I do? Nero is right.
I have to...tell Jasmine the truth.

JASMINE: (from a distance) Ali, you Ali, you coming here?

ALADDIN: (Puts on his hat and smiles) Well, there we go. (He enters the garden.) Jasmine? Where are you?

(We see IAGO in costume, standing on wooden poles next to a FLAMINGO in a pond. Practicing JASMINE's voice).

IAGO: Huh... Quick on the Menager.

ALADDIN: I'm coming.

(We see ALADDIN speed past, ignoring the birds. IAGO laughs evilly, then turns around and looks into the smiling face of the FLAMINGO).

FLAMINGO: ¡Uh!

IAGO: There's a problem, pinky?! (He cleans the bird’s feet off the floor.
IAGO laughs gleefully as he runs through the palace and finds the lamp under his pillow.)
Boy, Jafar glad to see you! (He rubs his forehead like JAFAR's in imitation).
Excellent work, Iago! (Normal) Ah, go ahead. (JAFAR) No, really – on a scale of one to ten, you’re… eleven!
(Normal) Oh Jafar. I am embarrassed, I am in tears. (Running the lantern).

(Cut to the palace. The SULTAN is standing on top announcing to the crowd.)

SULTAN: People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a mate!

(Cut to behind the curtain where JASMINE is watching. ALADDIN emerges from under the stairs).

ALADDIN: Jasmine: Bamako?

JASMINE: Ali, i taara min?

ALADDIN: Jasmine, let me tell you something.

JASMINE: The whole kingdom has made a father announcement!

ALADDIN: No! But Jasmine, listen to me!

JASMINE: Good luck! (He throws himself on stage with the SULTAN, where he sees the whole audience).

SULTAIN: ...A ye wulu ye!

ALADDIN: Oh Ala.

(Above, IAGO and JAFAR look out the window).

IAGO: Look at them, shaking the little whiner.

JAFAR: Let them sign. (He picks up the lantern and shakes it. The GENIUS appears).

GENIE: You know Al, I (turns to see JAFAR) really yyyyyy - I don't know. (He looks down for the poster).
Ali’s role tonight shows someone tall, dark and sweaty.

JAFAR: I am your master now! (throws GENIE to the ground and kicks GENIE in the face).

GENIE: I was afraid of that.

JAFAR: Genie, give me my first wish. I would love to work with him AS SULTAN!

(Where dark clouds cut around the palace. The tomb shakes. The roof breaks and the SULTAN and ALADDIN collide.)

ALADDIN: ¡Waw!

SULTAN: Bless my soul. What is this? What is going on? Oh god, what’s going on?!

JASMINE: ¡Tata!

(His hair falls out of his head. When he catches her, his whole body convulses, and they strip him of all his clothes except his boxing.
These costumes were reproduced in JAFAR.)

JAFAR: ¡Ey hey hey!

SULTAN: Jafar, you are... a terrible traitor.

IAGO: Yes, Traitorous Vile Sultan.

ALADDIN: Oh, what? Well, let's see! (takes off his hat, but finds it empty) Lamp!

JAFAR: Interrogator- viewers, Abooboo.

(They both look up and see a great GENIUS carrying the palace above. ALADDIN blows his whistle and MATTO runs to greet him.
They fly right next to GENI's head.)

ALADDIN: All right! No!

GENIE: Sorry, kid, I just got a new boss. (He puts it on the palace hill).

SULTAN: Jafar, I must leave you alone!

JAFAR: Ah, but now there's a new order... My order! You finally bowed to me!

(SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not).

JAFAR: We will never bow down to you!

IAGO: Why am I not surprised?

JAFAR: If you would not bow to the Sultan, you would bow to the Witch!
(to GENIE) Genie, my second wish: I want to be the world's strongest wizard!

ALADDIN: Nero ye!

(GENIE reaches out. ALADDIN tries to stop it, but fails, and another of GENIE(tm)'s trademark lightning strikes JAFAR, restoring him to normal.)

IAGO: Brothers, welcome Agrabah, Wizard Jafar!

JAR: to squat? Ah yes, a great understatement! (Just JASM and SULTAN from thujrupamp picture is panpachaniwr kneeling with him.
JAFAR laughs RAJAH ladiyakasi runs away. Catch RAJAH and the tiger turns into a cat.)
Alayaru, baby! Oh princess... (raises her chin high with her wand)... I want to meet someone.

ALADDIN: (on camera) Jafar! ¡Jan baarat'amti!

.

JAFAR: Principal Ali Jïsa, as usual. Lakaja's got it right

(JAFAR accepts thayaruw association.) Yes, there will be nayemat Mä phallawiw, k'ariw wali sumapunw, please use it. Welcome to the very curious prince Ali!

(BACK TO JAFAR ALI ALADDIN.)

IAGO: Where's Aladdino's voice?

JASMINE: All right.

ALADDIN: Jasmine is.

JASMINE: What about you?

Aladdin: I'll ask you here on Friday, how to do it.

JAFAR: So Alijj Aladino was sitting. As a scam, continue? Believe in His personality and Reason
The potential collapse of the yea mèni solo, it is said, may be accomplished.
Back to top

IAGO: Adós, hurry and get it!

jafar: ex-priiiiiiiiince aaaaaaaaaaaaaAallllLlLiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!

(JAFAR pilan ABU normale.
F2B, Then We See A Hollow Wasteland Where A Pillar Falls And Slides. The latter is forgotten. ALADDIN sits the husband out, and can wo very cold.)

ALADDIN: Abu ye? ¡Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.

.
(He digs up ABU u ka and puts it on his jacket.) Abu! ¿A person's iyaw sasmati? I'm sorry, Abu. I’m not sure if he’s going to.
in any case. I have to go back and sort things out. (He starts walking in the snow and ends up walking on a cold carpet).
Rug! (He looks up and sees ALFORMA tied to the pole. He pulls down to try and free ALFORMA.
He can't do that, so he starts snowballing at the edge of the pile.) Abu, start grinding! Very!
(Eventually enough snow clears, and the pillar begins to melt. ALADDIN runs away, looks back, and sits down.
The pillar rolls over him, and as he disappears, ALADDIN and ABU find themselves perched on the rock formed by the window of the pillar.)
Than! Light! (He looks at the turban he made with the terrified ABU. MATO blows snow and runs to get it).
Now, back to Agrabah! Let's go!

(We return to a large shot of the exterior of Agrabah shrouded in red clouds. Cut to a slight zoom inside the throne room.
IAGO is tied to the SULTAN like a doll, JASMINE is tied to the throne.)

IAGO: Does the gunner want some cookies? Those are cookies. Drop it all down your throat. It’s okay here!

(JAFAR removes the chain and pushes JASMINE with an apple).

JASMINE: Don't give up! Jafar, leave it there!

(IAGO pauses, then continues).

JAFAR: I think it’s great that you’re this character, Jasmine. (He bites the apple he is holding.) A wild flower as beautiful as you must be in the hands of the greatest man in the world. (She waves her hand and reveals the crown.) What do you say, dear? Why, since you're a queen...

(Takes a glass of wine and throws it in his face).

JASMINE: Of course!

JAFAR: I want to learn growth! (He steps back and raises his hand to kick her. Then he stops.) No Genie... I've decided to do the last thing I want. I wanted Princess Jasmine to love me unexpectedly.

(JASMINE screams. We see ALADDIN running back to town).

GENIE: (Again as Buckley) Ah, master... there are a few extras, quid pro quo.

JAFAR: Don't answer me, you worst enemy! I told you what you did...slave!

(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN by the window, signaling for a game).

JASMINE: (She stands up and puts the crown on her head.) Jafar! Um, I never knew how... you're so beautiful.

(Slap you NERO).

JAFAR: Mm, that’s better. (He lifts NERO's lips in the dark.) Now... Kitty, tell me something... about myself.

JASMINE: You're... big... and crazy...

JAFAR: Is he right?

JASMINE: Well dressed…

(JAFAR approaches him. ALADDIN jumps in with ABU, GENIE sees them).

GENIUS: Al! Al, little buddy!

ALADDIN: ¡Shh!

GENIE: (Opens and closes his mouth.) Al, I can't help it, I'm working for a master psycho right now. (His head consists of JAFAR and neck).

ALADDIN: Hey, I'm a street dog, remember? (Closes GENI's door.) I improvise.

(He drops a bunch of coins and hides near JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR backs away from ALADDIN.)

JAFAR: Jatka and so on.

JASMINE: And your hair is... well... curly! You stole my heart... (He wraps his arms around her.
He pretends to reach out to her, but in reality, ALADDIN invites her to come. He's doing his walking. IAGO observed.)

IAGO: Gag--mmmmmm it works! (ABU grabs her and shuts her mouth).

JAFAR: What is a street dog?

JASMINE: Some street dogs?

(They are kissing when IAGO manages to stir the pot. JAFAR turns to look at him, but JASMINE catches him and kisses him.
ALADDIN seemed to be a character. (IAGO and ABU look angry).

ABU JA IAGO: Nothing!

JAFAR: It's... (sees ALADDIN's vision of his crown.) YES! How many times to kill, boy?!

(She whispers to ALADDIN. JASMINE runs to her and falls to the ground. ALADDIN quickly grabs the wand).

ALADDIN: Take the lantern!

(JASMINE runs towards him. But JAFAR chokes ALADDIN, sending him in for the hour).

JAFAR: No! Ah-ah-ah, princess... Your time is up!

ALADDIN: Jasmine is a job!

(Sand starts falling on him from above).

IAGO: Ooh, good move, Jaf-- (He gets knocked out by ABU.)

(ABU runs towards the lamp).

JAFAR: Don't play with me! (He turns into a toy monkey).

ALADDIN: ¡Abu!

(TAPIT arrives soon.)

JAFAR: Things are moving fast now, baby! (JAFAR laughs as ALFORMA opens and shatters.
ALADDIN runs to the lamp again.) Understand? (His path is blocked by giant swords).
JAFAR grabbed the flashlight and laughed menacingly. ALADDIN draws the sword from the ground.) Just sweating! (He spits the Ring of Fire around ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Are you afraid to tell me about yourself, you dead coward?!

JAFAR: Well, right? Maybe you want to see how deadly I look! (He smiles wide and we see a snake mouth sticking out from behind his teeth.
It then transforms into a giant cobra and the ring of fire around ALADDIN is a dragon around ALADDIN.
JAFAR snake walks towards ALADDIN and on his third attempt ALADDIN swings the sword and hits JAFAR. (For the GENIE actors in A-line sweaters.)

GENIES: Rickem, rockem, racem, rake - you're going to kill me!

JAFAR: Get away from it!

(GENIE points to a small pennant with a “J” on it.)

GENIE: (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man. If he can't do that, AWESOME!

(ALADDIN uses the distraction to break the clock, and JASMINE catches him. However, JAFAR notices him and blocks the way.
ALADDIN falls and loses his sword.)

JASMINE: Aladdin!

(ALADDIN jumps on a boulder and rolls it down, grabbing a sword as he goes.
He rounds the corner, but the pursuing snake fails, and JAFAR's face hits the wall and crushes him outside the palace.
ALADDIN jumps on the snake's back and stabs it. JAFAR shouted in anger. ALADDIN tries again to save the princess.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine, you can!

(He almost hits the glass with his sword, when JAFAR grabs him).

JAFAR: (laughs evil) You little fool! Do you think you can beat the strongest animal on Earth?!

IAGO: (Appearing from behind the GENIE) Fuck him, Jafar. It’s like… awk! (GENIE shakes)

JAFAR: Without a genie, my son, you are nothing!

ALADDIN: (a thought) Genius. Intelligent! Genie is stronger than you!

JAFAR: Are we there?!

ALADDIN: Give me your power! He can pull it off!

GENIE: Al, what are you doing? Why did you bring me here?

ALADDIN: Believe it, Jafar! You are still just…second best!

JAFAR: You are right! His power is stronger than mine. But it doesn’t last long…

(JAFAR turns around GENIUS).

GENIUS: This guy is crazy. He’s a little drunk. Someone shot too many snakes. (His hand becomes a snake and hits his head with it).

JAFAR: Slave! I make my third wish! I... want to be ALL GENIUS!

GENIE: (disagreeing) Very nice. Your desires are the rules. Well done, Al.

(GENIE smashes JAFAR with a final thunderbolt marked GENIE(tm)). JAFAR’s dead form turns into consciousness.
We see JASMINE'S long arm disappear into the sand. ALADDIN runs up and ends up breaking the glass. (Sand falls Princess Jasmine).

JAFAR: Snake... Snake! Power... Absolute power!

JASMINE: (to ALADDIN) What have you done?

ALADDIN: Believe it or not!

(A blue lantern appears from JAFAR's base. JAFAR spells).

JAFAR: The earth is mine! Consider!

ALADDIN: Don't worry, Jafar! Are you forgetting something?

JAFAR: (questioning) Heavy?

ALADDIN: You want to be a genius? You got it right!

(Men on JAFAR arms).

JAFAR: WE?!

ALADDIN: And everything that goes with it!

JAFAR: Hey! AYI!

IAGO: Come on!

ALADDIN: So much art!

(IAGO tries to escape, but JAFAR catches him.)

IAGO: Come on, you genius! I don't care, I don't care--!

ALADDIN: Very rare environment.

GENIUS: Al, you little genius, you!

(ABU returns to normal, MATO parades again, JASMINE, SULTAN and RAJAH stand together.
The RAJAH jumps into the arms of the SULTAN, and everything changes. The SULTAN crumbles under the weight of the new RAJAH.
The palace is back where it was in the city. ALADDIN picks up a new lantern.)

JAFAR: (both appear from under the lamp.) Get your back out of my face!

IAGO: Oh, shut up, you fool!

JAFAR: Don't tell me to shut up!

GENIE: I'm sorry. (He carries the lantern to the balcony. He's dressed now.
Finally, he tried to throw the lantern away, but when he opened his hand, he threw it into the forest.)
Ten Thousand Years of Wonder Watch to rest!

(Jafar and Iago continue to argue as they disappear. Jasmine walks towards Aladdin. They hold hands, but both look sad).

Aladdin: Jasmine, I lied about the king.

Jasmine: I know why.

Aladdin: Well, I guess...this...this is a greeting? (GENIE turns her head in the corner, startled by what she hears).

Jasmine: Oh this stupid slave. It’s not right! I love you.

Genie: (smiles) Al, okay. I have a little need for you. Just say the word and you will be king again.

Aladdin: But Genie, what about your free life?

Genie: Hey, it's just perpetual bondage. It’s very interesting. (He sits down beside her).
Al, you won't in a million years meet another girl like her. Believe me, I know. I'm looking at it.

Aladdin: I love you, Jasmine, but... I have to pretend nothing.

Jasmine: N b’a ye.

(They look at each other one last time, and ALADDIN goes back to NERO).

Aladdin: Genie, I want you to be free.

Genius: The true lineage of the future king. What do I have ?

Aladdin: (Holding the lantern towards the GENIUS.) Genie, you are free!

(A transformation follows, the chains fall from GENIE's wrist, the lamp falls uselessly to the ground. GENIE picks it up and looks at it).

Genie: (Unconvinced.) Hey, hey! I am free to go. I am free to go. (He hands the lantern to ALADDIN.) Quick, quick, you want something special.
Say, "I want the Nile to flow. Love the Nile River. Give it a try!

Aladdin: I wait for the Nile.

Genie: Not at all! (He laughs hysterically. It runs like a pinball machine on the porch.) Oh, it's fun! I am free! I am finally free!
I almost hit the road. I want to explore the world! I--

(He picks up his suitcase, but looks down at ALADDIN who looks very worried).

Aladdin: Genie, I love you.

Genie: I'm sorry, Al. (sniff) No matter what anyone says... you'd be king to me.

(They kiss. The Sultan steps forward).

Sultan: That’s right. Actually, you have expressed my point of view. This rule creates a problem .

Jasmine: The father?

Sultan: Well, am I the Sultan or am I the Sultan? From now on, the princess will marry whomever she sees fit.

Jasmine: (With a smile on her face, she runs into ALADDIN's arms.) He! I choose... I choose you, Aladdin.

Aladdin: Hello. Call me Al.

(They will kiss as big yellow arms gather them all together. Genie is wearing a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat).

Genie: Oh, all of you. Come here. Great group hugs! Group hugs, oops! Do you mind if I kiss the monkey? (Kissing Abu).
Oh the hair-raising! Well, you can do no wrong around this ice cream. I'm going to go! Well, you two dark lovers!
Hello, Rugman: ciao! I look like history! No, I am a mythologist! No, I don't care what I am, I'm free!

(The genie flew into the blue sky, leaving a sparkler behind.
They cut (the jump is made worse by the fireworks at night. We made the mistake of seeing Aladdin and Jasmine running on the carpet.)

[Aladdin] is .
A new era
[Jasmine] .
A whole new life
Both:
(off-camera chorus) Me and you!
[male singers]
The new world!
(After they flee into the moonlight and disappear, the moon returns to reveal NERO's smiling face.
Suddenly, the film cuts out of the "projector," and GENIUS expands and focuses on the audience.)

Genie: I did like.

(Restore the film, restore the moon. Black fading)


Aladdin is a brother

(Fade to black. Hip of purple mist in front of a wall of red flames.
- Dust in gold letters: "Aladdin". The songs are shiny and bouncy. In the forest, a petty trader on a camel) .

(On the street at night, a trader climbs out of his camel and talks to us)

[kamɛlɔsi jachaqt'asiskiwa].

Peddler: Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. Get a little closer.
(Camera zooms in on the shopkeeper's face) Too close. It’s a little shorter .
(He takes his face away from the camera slightly) There we go. Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, enchantment, .
(The camel sack opens which serves as a bazaar stall) and even other items here in Jordan are for sale today.
I want to get lost. Uh huh. Let’s take a look. Than. Hookah and coffee makers together . Also make julienne potatoes . There is no accusation. (presses the table) no.
It was also broken. So that is a good idea! Let’s take a look. (Picks up the Tupperware) Never seen one that didn't break down before. This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware .
Hear. (He opens his mouth, hears the raspberry..) Ah, that's good. (The camera starts panning to the right. The pirate runs to catch up.) Wait, don't go there! (Stop the page.)
You realize you know better than all the very rare things. I guess it’s fine then, come to think of it.
(The vendor pulls the iconic Magic Lamp from his sleeve.) Don't let its worldly appearance fool you.
Like so many other things, it's not what's on the outside that counts, it's what's on the inside. (Another page, this one goes further to the right.
The salesman rushes in again.) This is no ordinary lamp! It changed the young man’s life.
The boy who loved the lantern was more than he was. Diamonds are hard. Maybe you want to hear a story?
(The merchant pours the glittering dust from the lamp onto his hands).
The dark night begins... (The pirate throws dust into the sky where he creates the starry night.) where a dark man waits with dark intentions.

(Camera switches to Jafar sitting on his horse, Iago perched on his shoulder. Gazeem approaches them).

[nickelanaka horses].

Jafar: I ye late.

Gazeem: Many apologies, oh Sick One.

Jafar: So you get it?

Gazeem: I had to cut some of my lips, but I did it. (He pulls half of the locket out. Jafar grabs it, but Gazeem pulls it out.) Ah-ah-ahhh. Wealth. (Iago shouts as Iago walks by and grabs the locket.) Oh!

Jafar: Trust me, honey. You get what comes to you.

Iago: What's wrong with you? So that is a good idea!

(Jafar takes the other half of the locket. He makes contact with them and makes a golden eagle. He lives and flies away).

Jafar: Hurry up! Follow the path!

(So ​​kan, u saba bɛ locket gɛn ka tɛmɛ kungo kɔnɔ min falen bɛ kalo yeelen na)

The men's horses lift up on their hind legs and throw their horses. Jafar smiles as the tiger's head opens its mouth hole.)

[the horse screams].

[cold weeping].

Jafar: Finally, after years of searching, Wonder Hole.

Iago: Awk. Wonderful hole!

Gazeem: ( sighs) By Allah…

Jafar: Now you have to decide. Bring me a lamp! The rest is yours, but the lamp is mine. [laugh]

(Gazeem begins to approach the mouth of the beast, at the mouth of the cave. He laughs as he walks).

Iago: Oh lamp. Oh, lamp. (Now it's just Iago and Jafar, with Iago opening the door in normal English.) Damn, where did you get that bozo?

(Jafar puts his hand over his mouth and shuts it up. Gazeem crawls to the edge of the cave.
He's looking intently at the inside of his mouth as his lips turn into a vine.
He clung to a lion's tooth, but was startled by the sound of voices in the valley).

Cave: [echo growling] Who disturbed my sleep?

Gazeem: [the thief whispers] I, Gazeem, humble thief.

P'iya: Mo uka. Only one is entered, which is of long importance. Diamonds are hard.

(Gazeem turns to Jafar with a questioning look).

Jafar: What are you waiting for? Jack is the one.

[animal pride] .

(Gazeem hesitates, then goes into the cave. Still afraid to put his foot down. Nothing happens. He calmly starts walking again. Then he hears another scream. He turns, though." The mouth of the beast closes and the drum falls back to normal.Only Jafar remains, Iago and two different half-medallions.)

Jafar: Sisan!

Hole: Look for a diamond in the arch.

Iago: [sighs] I can't believe it. I believe in the truth! We will never put our hands on that stupid lamp! Forget about it! Let’s take a look. Let’s take a look.
I was coughing so hard and wanted to pee. (He runs into Jafar's arms).

Jafar: Be patient, Iago. Patience. Gazeem wasn’t very good.

Iago: (very nervous) Oh, that's awesome. It’s incredible… I think I’m going to die from this weird heart attack.
What are we going to do? We have a big problem here, a big- (Jafar pinches his bea k.)

Jafar: Yes. Only one can enter. I have to find this, this… diamond.

(Cut to top, Aladdin is running up the hill with the horn. He almost falls from the sky).

Razoul: Don't give up! Thief! I'll take the trophy from you, street dog!

Aladdin: (Looks back, then down, then towards the bread.) Is this all bread? Oooooh yeah!

(She jumps down on two ropes strung between the houses, the clothes drying up. She throws them in the air, picking up her own clothes as she walks. The last one approaches the end of the rope by the window." by, a woman raises her hand and dances in the blinds .Aladdin hits the doors and falls into the street, he falls and destroys a lot of clothes and a pile of clothes surrounds him.He takes his clothes off the top floor, he about to drink his bread. when...)

Guard 1: Over there!

Guard 2: You won't get over this easily!

Aladdin: You thought that was easy?

(Looks at the three women mockingly).

Razoul: You two, this way, and you, follow me. We'll get it.

(Aladdin puts on a cloak to cover himself to hide himself. He runs to the women).

Aladdin: Hello, ladies.

Woman 1: We had a bit of trouble this morning, didn't we Aladdin?

Aladdin: Is there a problem? Now, it doesn’t exist. You only get in trouble when you get caught.

(A hand grabs Aladdin's arm and pulls him back. It's Razoul. Aladdin's mask falls off).

Razoul: I found you!

Aladdin: I'm in trouble.

Razoul: And this time... (Abu shouts, pulling the guard's hat over his eyes. Abu points to the guard's head, laughing).

Aladdin: Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

Culture: Ash.

Aladdin: Come on. Let’s get out of here. am.

(The guard throws Aladdin, but he misses the fish barrel. Abu waddles the guard, then dodges the attack. Aladdin then drops the guard's pants)

♪ A board before the end ♪

♪ Going a little further ♪

♪ I only steal what I can't sell ♪ That's all.

♪ I can steal food ♪

♪ Otherwise, good luck! ♪

Garadi: AYI!!!

(The gradient jumps on Aladdin, but is shot. His paint rolls on the pots)

Leader: Get it!

(Aladdin leaps towards the artist, who is walking safely through the hot ashes. The guards run through the ashes, burning their feet and jumping in pain.
Aladdin and Abu encounter a sword eater, and Abu turns around to remove the sword from the eater's mouth. (Abu goes to the guards, who stand in fear).

Guard: He has a sword!

Razoul: You idiots. We all have swords!

(The guards draw their swords. Abu lowers his sword and runs. Aladdin and Abu are surrounded again, guards coming from left and right.
(He jumps up on a stunt suit that lands on the street while all the guards shoot at each other).

Aladdin: ♪ He jumps before my feet ♪

Guardians: Destruction!

Aladdin: ♪ Jumps before the hump ♪

Guardianaka: Mosquitoes on the road!

Aladdin: ♪ One stop before disaster strikes ♪

Guardianaka: ¡Namarkɛla!

Aladdin: ♪ They go fast, but I am fast ♪

Garadi: Come on!

(The guards chase Aladdin up the stairs and into the room. He grabs the rug...)

Aladdin: ♪ Done, ♪

♪ It’s better for you to be on ♪

♪ I want a better world, ♪

♪ All you have to do is jump! ♪

(..then he jumps out of the window like the carpet is magic. The guards chase him out the window, but they fall right into the street and land on a baggage cart with a sign that says '. say "Mad Hakim's Discount Fertilizer.")

Guards: Glad! Hey!

(Aladdin uses the carpet as a parachute for a safe landing. Aladdin and Abu greet each other)

Aladdin: And now, honorable effendi, we celebrate. Light.

(Aladdin cuts the bread in half and gives half to ABU, who begins to eat.
But Aladdin looked up and saw two kids searching for food in the dumpster.
The girl sees him, then throws away what she's got and tries to hide. Aladdin looks down at them, then at the bread, then at Abouta.)

Abu: Nam, nam! Voi ei.

(Abou takes a bite of his food, but Aladdin gets up and approaches the children. The girl pushes her brother back).

Aladdin: [sighs] This is great. Jack is the one. You have to take it.

[laruña] .

[inach'usaru] .

Abu: Ah, don't do that. Or did he see her ?

Man: On Palace Road, I guess. Another suitor for the princess.

[laruña] .

[woman screams].

[hintasa] this.

Prince Ahmed: Get out of my way, brats.

Aladdin: Hey! If I were as rich as you, I'd have welfare money.

Prince Ahmed: That’s good. I will train you to walk!

[cɛw bɛ ŋɛɲɛ kɛ].

[grimace] and so on.

Aladdin: Look, Abu. It’s not every day you see a horse with two hindquarters.

Audience: Wow!

Prince Ahmed: Ha! You are an important street dog. You are born a street dog, you die a street dog and only dogs cry for you.

Aladdin: I'm useless. And I don’t have dogs. [sighs] And, Abu. Let's go home.
♪ Riffraff, street snow. I didn't buy it. If only they had looked closer. Are they a poor boy? Not the father. They think I have a lot more to do. ♪
One day Abu, things will change. We are rich, we live in a palace, we have absolutely no problems.

[kɔw bɛ sɔgɔsɔgɔ].

Prince Ahmed: I've never been so shy.

Sultan: Oh King Ahmed. You wouldn’t leave so soon, would you?

Prince Ahmed: Good luck marrying her.

Sultan: Ah! Jasmine was like that. Jasmine is doing well! Jasmine is doing well! Jasmine is doing well!

[murisee] .

Sultan: The Changer, Rajah. That's why Prince Ahmed went so hard.

Jasmine: Oh, Dad. Rajah continued to play with him.
Isn't that right, Rajah? You're playing an overdressed, defensive Prince Ahmed, aren't you?

[both laugh].

[clears throat].

Sultan: My dear, you must not refuse all suitors who call you. The law says so.

Both: You're marrying a prince...

Sultan: Until next birthday.

Jasmine: The law is bad.

Sultan: Just three days.

Jasmine: Dad, I hate this. When I get married, I want it to be a love marriage.

Sultan: Jasmine...it's not just this rule. I won't be here forever, well, I just... I want you to be taken care of. Anticipated a little bit.

Jasmine: Try to understand. I never did anything on my own. I never had any real friends.

[inach'usaru] .

Jasmine: Except for you, Rajah. I never left the palace walls.

Sultan: But Jasmine, you are a princess.

Jasmine: So maybe she doesn't want to be a princess anymore.

Sultan: Oooh! I...I...Allah has forbidden you to have daughters.

Jaa: Hmm?

Sultan: I don't know where he got it. His mother wasn't too hard on him. I see! Ah, Jafar is . My most trusted mentor. I want you to know.

Jafar: My life just serves you, sir.

Sultan: It’s a building for suitors. Jasmine doesn't want to choose a man. I am at the end of the row.

Iago: Aha! You must be honest!

Sultan: [laughs] Oh! A biscuit, good Polly.

Jafar: [Jafar laughs] Your King knows how to seduce animals.

[Iago muso] .

Jafar: Now maybe we should find a solution to this complex problem.

Sultan: If anyone can help, you can.

Jafar: But you had to use Mystic Blue Diamond for that.

Sultan: That’s right. Oh my ring? But it’s been in the family for years.

Jafar: We need to find a mate for the princess. Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

Sultan: Everything will be fine.

Jafar: That’s a diamond.

Sultan: Here, Jafar. Everything you need is well laid out.

Jafar: You are very kind, liege. Now run and play with your little toys, hmm?

Sultan: Yes. It will be very interesting.

Iago: [spitting, coughing] I can't take it anymore! If I had to choke on another one of those disgustingly soft cookies… Bam! Beat!

Jafar: Calm down, Iago.

Iago: And I grabbed his head. Beat!

Jafar: Soon, I will be the Sultan, not this confused fool.

Iago: And then I threw the cookies down his throat. Ha, ha!

[inach'usaru] .

Jasmine: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here, I can live my life too. I will miss you.

[inach'usaru] .

Jasmine: That’s true.

[customers call].

Aladdin: Well, Abu. Go.

Melon Vendor: Try this. Your flavors dance and sing.

[yell] .

Melon Vendor: Hands off.

[kɔktɛyi] .

Melon Vendor: Well, you... Get out of here, bloody dirty monkey!

Abu: Good morning.

Aladdin: Ayiwa, Abu.

[maltisiwi] .

Aladdin: The dining room.

Grocer: Good lady, buy a bowl. There could be no better vessel made of copper or silver.

Nose seller: Sweet dates. Sweet dates and figs. Sweet dates with pistachios.

Ironmonger: Should a woman wear a necklace? Beautiful necklace of a beautiful woman.

Fish Vendor: Fresh fish! We caught them, you bought them!

Jasmine: Okay now. I don't believe in that. I see!

[the fire]

Jasmine: That’s okay.

[minfɛn dɔɔni dɔ].

[burps] and so on.

Jasmine: I'm really, really sorry.

Aladdin: All right.

Abu: Uh. How do I live my life? How do I live my life?

Jasmine: Oh, you're probably hungry. Here’s what’s there.

Apple Merchant: A ka fisa i ka a sara.

Jasmine: Is it a jig?

Apple Seller: Now you stole my cart.

Jasmine: Oh, my, my, my. I don't have any money.

Apple seller: Thief!

Jasmine: Please... If you'll let me go to the palace, I can get it from the Sultana.

Apple Retailer: Do you know what the crime of stealing is?

Jasmine: Now! Now Thank you!

Aladdin: Thank you, good sir. I'm so glad you found it. I'm looking for you everywhere.

Jasmine: What are you doing?

Aladdin: Play the game.

Pomifeerela: Do you, sir, have a smell?

Aladdin: Unfortunately, yes. She is my sister. He’s a bit crazy.

Apple seller: He said he knew the Sultan.

Aladdin: He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

Jasmine: Oh wise Sultan, how can I serve you?

[my pot]

Aladdin: Sad, isn't it? But there is no problem. Now, come on, sister. It’s time to go to the doctor.

Jasmine: Hello, Doctor. How will this be done?

Aladdin: Now, now, now. Don’t be afraid. Come, Sultan, come.

[something, ɲɛjibɔ].

Apple customer: Good? What? Come back here, little thieves!

[bɔgɔbɔgɔli] .

Iago: With all due respect, mouse, can't we just wait for the real storm?

Jafar: Hold your breath, Iago. More immediately.

Iago: Yes, mighty Evil. [sighs] .

Jafar: Nothing, sands of time. Tell me who is in the valley. Than! Than! Here’s what’s there. My diamond is hard.

Iago: Is he right? Is this the payoff you’ve been waiting for?

Jafar: Let's give the guards a call to the palace, okay?

Iago: Very interesting. [cough]

[dusukasi ŋɛɲɛ].

Aladdin: I'm already there.

Jasmine: I want to thank you for protecting this guy.

Aladdin: Forget it. So this is your first time in the market, right?

Jasmine: Is it that obvious?

Aladdin: Well, you're famous. I mean you wouldn't know how dangerous Agrabah would be.

Jasmine: Hmm. I am a fast learner.

Ash: Wow.

Aladdin: [laughs] Hello. Date. Than. Wow. Leave your head there . Be careful.

Jasmine: Do you live here?

Aladdin: Yes. I am with Abumpiki. Come, go as you please.

Jasmine: That’s amazing.

Aladdin: Well, not much, but it's amazing. Wow. The palace looks really amazing, doesn’t it?

Jasmine: Oh, that’s lovely.

Aladdin: I wonder what it would be like to live here, with servants and staff.

Jasmine: Of course. People tell you where to go and how to dress.

Aladdin: Better than this. Always foraging for food and avoiding guards .

Jasmine: You’re not free to make your own decisions.

Aladdin: Sometimes it does.

Jasmine: Just you.

Both: ...trap.

Aladdin: [clears his throat] So where did you come from?

Jasmine: What does that matter? I ran away and didn’t come back.

Aladdin: Really? How can it be so?

Object: Action yes.

Jasmine: My father is forcing me to marry him.

Aladdin: It's... horrible. Abu!

[smile angrily] .

Jasmine: E dun?

Aladdin: Abu ko, uh... o ma tilen.

Abu: What is that?

Jasmine: Oh, wa?

Aladdin: Yes, of course.

Jasmine: And does Abu have anything else to say?

Aladdin: Well, he hopes she'll do something to help him.

Abu: Yes way.

Jasmine: Hmm. Tell her that's cool.

Razoul: Oh good.

Both: They're after me! YOU?

Jasmine: Maybe my dad sent them...

Aladdin: Can you believe me?

Jasmine: E dun?

Aladdin: Can you believe me?

Jasmine: He has …

Aladdin: Then jump!

Razoul: We kept running, didn't we, street dog?

Aladdin: Run away! Go! Get out of here!

Razoul: Take it from me! This is prison for you, kid.

Aladdin: I have to go.

Jasmine: He has to go.

Razoul: Look here, guys. That’s a slap in the face!

[garadiw bɛ ŋɛɲɛ kɛ].

Jasmine: Must go with the Princess's request.

Razoul: Princess Jasmine.

Aladdin: Where is the Princess?

Abu: Princess ye?

Razoul: What are you doing inside the palace? And this street dog.

Jasmine: That’s not your problem. Just do as I say. Let her go, please.

Razoul: I wish, princess, or orders must come from Jafar. Talk to him about it.

Jasmine: Believe me, I will. Is that Jafar?

Jafar: Oh princess.

Iago: Aha! Jafar, I'm sorry.

Jafar: How can I help you?

Jasmine: The guards just took the boy to the market at your request.

Jafar: Your father condemned me to peace in Agrabah. The boy was a bad person.

Jasmine: What's his fault?

Iago: I can't breathe, Jafar.

Jafar: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.

Iago: If you... Aah! That’s intriguing!

Jasmine: He didn't catch me. I was running away.

Jafar: Oh my dear. Oh, how sweet it is. I got it, but I know…

Jasmine: What do you mean?

Jafar: Unfortunately, the young man's case has already been filed.

Jasmine: Any words?

Jafar: I am.

[son of Jasmine].

Jafar: Mestatamamma , o ye .

Jasmine: Flowing.

Jafar: I'm sorry, princess.

Jasmine: How do you do that? [huge]

Iago: [cough] [cough, cough] Well, how did it go?

Jafar: I think he carried himself well.

Jasmine: [Jasmine sobs] It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't even know his name.

[Rajah interrupts].

Aladdin: She was a princess. I don't believe in that. Maybe I looked silly to him.

Abu: Yeah-hoo! Aladdin is great! Good morning!

Aladdin : Abu Here.

[yell] .

Aladdin: Come on, help me out of here.

[English].

Aladdin: Hey, he was in trouble. Ah, it’s so good.

Item: Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

Aladdin: Don't worry. I will never see him again. I am a street dog, remember? And there is a rule. She must marry the king. He deserves a king.

What's There: Wow!

Aladdin: I'm a fool.

Old Jaffa: You fooled out, son.

Aladdin: Who are you?

Old Jafar: A humble prisoner like you. But together, we can be many.

Aladdin: I'm listening.

Old Jafar: There’s a well, a baby, a wonderful cave, full of treasures beyond your wildest dreams…

Abu: You are right!

Old Jafar: I bet you have enough resources to make your princess too.

Iago: Jafar, can you hurry? I am dying for it. [jafar beats him].

Aladdin: [ chuckles] Wait here.

Abu: [sighs] Oh!

Aladdin: That’s true. That's why you came here... Abu! NOW!

Ding: Unbelievers!

Ash: Ohh.

Cave: You touched an irresistible treasure! From now on, you will never see the light again!

Aladdins: Wow!

Abou: Damn! Damn! Damn!

Aladdin: I found you! Wow. Matt, let's go. Abu! Abu, it’s time to be scared. You start to panic.

Both: Wow!

[Takes a deep breath].

[lightning bolts].

[making a loud noise].

Aladdin: Help me.

Old Jaffa: Throw me a torch.

Aladdin: I can't take it. Give me your hand.

Chief Jaffa: Give me your lamp first. [maniacal laughter] Yes! finally! [laugh]

Aladdin: [Aladdin struggles] What are you doing?

Old Jaffa: I'll give you your reward. [Old Jafar's voice returns to normal Jafar] Eternal reward. [Abu then bites his hand, then screams].

[yell]

[cries of falling mountains].

Jafar: [laughs] Mine. [removes his mask] It's all mine. I... Where is he? Now… YOUR OOOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!!!!

Sultan: Jasmine? Oh dear brother. What is the wrong thing?

Jasmine: [sniffs] Jafar... what the fuck.

Sultan: There, there, my dear. We will sort things out. Now tell me everything.

Abu: That’s true. Aladdin is a brother. Develop. Aladdin is a brother.

Aladdin: Ah! My head is shattered. They were arrested. This two-faced jacket boy! Whoever it was, he went with the lantern long ago.

Object: Jesus!

Aladdin: [laughs] Well, you little mind thief. It's like ugly, useless scrap metal.

Aladin: Uh... Uh, Aladin.

Genius: Aladdin. Greetings to Aladdin. It’s great to have you on the show. Did I call you "Ali"? Or maybe it's just "Din". Who's the "Laddie"?
They'd say, "Here, boy. Come on, Laddie."
Aladdin: I nodded more than I expected.

Genie: Do you smoke? Would you mind if I did? [laughs] Oh, sorry, Cheetah. I hope I didn't burn the edges. Oh, the Rugman guy. I haven't seen you in a few thousand years.
Give me a pompom. Than. Uh huh. Say you are younger than my old master. Either that or I am overweight. Look at a place.
Do I look different to you?

Aladdin: Wait a minute. Am I your master?

Genie: Of course. It may be instructive. What do you want from me? Always amazing, extended content, often imitated but never copied… [echo].

Jafar: Surprise, congratulations.

Sultan: That was lovely. Yeah, I see some potential in that. This guy is awesome. And a king for that matter.
[sighs] If we’re lucky, we won’t marry Jasmine.

Jafar: I'm not sure, sir.

Sultan: This is insane. One of the things I am proud of as Jafar is that I am a very good judge of character.

Iago: Oh, good judge. Very. No!

Sultan: Jasmine likes this.

Aladdin: And I already like Princess Jasmine.

Jafar: Your high, now. I have to mention Jasmine. This guy is no different. What makes her think she's right for a princess?

Aladdin: Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa. Let him meet me. I will win your daughter.

Jasmine: How dare you. You guys are fine. Will I have to decide the future? I’m not going to get an answer.

Sultan: Oh my dear. Don’t worry, Prince Ali. Give Jasmine time to calm down.

Jafar: I think it’s time to say goodbye to Prince Abooboo.

Aladdin: Genie, I need help.

Genie: Well, Sparky, this is the deal. If you want to get revenge on that little woman, you have to be smart. Did you get that?

Aladini: Mun?

Genie: Tell her the truth!

Aladdin: Not at all. If Jasmine knew I was actually a dirty street dog, she'd laugh at me.

Genius: A woman appreciates a man who can make her happy. Al, as an aside, you really need to behave.

Aladdin: Hey, that's the last thing. Well, I'm going to see him. I… I have to be kind, to be fierce, to be brave. How are you doing?

Genie: Like a king.

SO. That would not be known to me.

Jasmine: No, I don't think so.

Genie: You're welcome, Casanova. Let's talk about it. She’s smart, she’s funny, her hair, her eyes. No. Choose a function.

On Palace Road, I guess.
Another suitor for the princess.

Good luck marrying her.
Oh yeah, yeah yeah! Jasmine was like that.
Jasmine is doing well!

That’s interesting, Rajah.
That's why Prince Ahmed did it

Rajah continued to play with him.
Isn't that right, Rajah?
you’re just kidding

The personal acquaintance of Prince Ahmed,
Isn't that true ?
My friend, don’t argue
every suitor who comes calling.
The law says so
you marry a prince…
you know her wollodon.
The law is not good.
Only three days left.
Lord, I hate to be forced to do that.
If I get married, .
I want it out of love.
Jasmine ye...
it is not this rule.
I won't be here forever,
suma i...
I want to know without a doubt
you will be taken care of.
Anticipated a little bit.
Try to understand.
I never did anything on my own.
I never had any real friends.
Unless like you, Rajah.
I have never been there
outside the palace walls.
But Jasmine, you are a princess.
So maybe he doesn't want to
being more of a princess.
Oooh ye! naya naya...
Allah has forbidden you to do so
should have daughters.
Mmm?
I don't know where he got it.
Her mother was not such a choice.
I see! Ah, Jafar is .
My most trusted mentor.
I want you to know.
Life is meant to serve you, sir.
It’s a married business.

I see!

in this complex problem.
If anyone can help, you will.
However, this may require some resolution

I see. Oh my ring?
But it’s been in the family for years.
We need to know that
the princess is single.
You're welcome.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Diamond was the name.
Here in Jaffar.
Everything you need is well laid out.
You are very kind, sir.
Now run and play
with your little toys, right?
Than. It will be very interesting.
Can't take it anymore!
I had to squeeze once again
those soft, ugly cookies…
Boom! I'm fighting!
Oh, you're fine, Lake.
Then I grabbed his head.
I'm fighting!
Soon I will be the Sultan,
not this stupid idiot.
And then filled with cookies
it was a darkness.
¡Haha!
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.
But I can't stay here
My life has to be me.
I will miss you.

Oh, you must be hungry.
Here’s what’s there.
Cut it and chop it.

Nobody steals a base.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.
- Setigiw!
- Amp sum.
If you let me go to the palace, .
I can get the Sultan.

is there a theft penalty?
No! I don't thank him!
Thank you, sir.
I'm so glad you found it.
I'm looking for you everywhere.

Do you know this girl?
But unfortunately, yes. She is my sister.
He’s a bit crazy.
He said he knew the Sultan.
He thinks the monkey is the Sultan.
O wise Sultan, how can I serve you?
Sad, isn't it?
But there is no problem.
Now, come on, sister.
It’s time to go to the doctor.
Sɔgɔma ɲuman, Dɔgɔtɔrɔ.

With all due respect,
You are rotten,

Breathe to save me, Lake. More immediately.
Yes, this is my father’s prayer.
No, time is slow.
A jira does not

Jesus! Jesus!
Here’s what’s there.
My diamond is hard.
Saw. He's called a clown
Did they expect that?
The guards to continue
a call to the palace, okay?
Rise.
Almost as much.
I would like to thank you
for the arrest of this man.
Forget about it.
So this is your first time
kind of, right?
Is that clear enough?
Well, you’re still famous.
I mean like you don't know
How Agrabah can fail .
Hmmm, I'm a bit of a student.
Oh.
Chuy.
Don. Ni.
Wow. Leave your head there .

Do you live here?
Than. I am with Abumpiki.
Come, go as you please.
She looks amazing.
Well, it didn’t, .
but he has a great vision.
Wow. P alace is visible
It’s interesting, isn’t it?
Oh, that’s funny.
I wondered how it would turn out
it's like I lived there
there are also slaves and slaves.
Oh, of course. People are providing information
where to go, how to dress.
Much better than this.
You are always looking for food
and avoid the guards.
You are not free
you have to make choices for yourself.
- Sometimes it happens.
- You're just.
...ansa.
So where did you come from?
What is the value of this?
I was running away
and I am not going back.
Really. How can it be so?
Why are you doing it.
My father encourages me
lost.
It's... horrible.
¡Abu!
Is there such a thing as that?
Abu says that.
it is not true.
Is there such a thing as that?
- Is that true?
- Kɔsɛbɛ.
Ja Abu
do you have anything else to say?
So he wants to be like that
what he could do to help.
Oh no, I don't.
Mmm.
Call it the best.
That's where you are.
"They're following me!" YOU?
- My father sent them away.
"Can you trust me?"
- Is he there?
"Can you trust me?"
- Joo...
So jump in!
Keep crossing paths, .
Aren't you, street dog?
Ride! Go! Get out of here!
Get this thing out of my hands!
"This is a prison for you, son."
- I'm going to go.
Let's go.
- Look here, guys. Cold in the streets.
Ola,
by order of the queen.
Princess Jasmine ye.
- Saraman?
- Saraman?
What do you do outside the palace?
And this street dog.
That’s not your problem.
Just do as I say. Let her go, please.
you will princesa
or my orders from Jafar.
- You have to talk to him.
- I don't care, I don't care.
Is that Jafar?
Oh the princess.
So that is a good idea! Jafar, I'm sorry.
How can I help you?
The guards only took the boy
it is in a state of flux.
Your father condemned me
Peace in Agrabah.
- The boy is a bad person.
- What is his right?
You can’t breathe, Jafar.
Why kidnap the princess, .
Kɔsɛbɛ.
You're the one.
Ah! That’s intriguing!
He didn’t arrest anyone.
I was running away.
Ohhh.
Oh, how sweet it is.
I knew...
What do you mean?
Oh, the boy's judgment
it is almost complete.
What is Aruchjasa?
In.
- With the fight.
- Yes.
I'm so sorry, princess.
How are you?
So how did that happen?
I think he took it well.
It's all my fault, Rajah.
- I don't know his real name.
She was a princess.
Ne ma da o la.
I may have looked it up
so foolish for him.
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin is great!
Ask everyone!
The inheritance. Akana.
Come on, help us out of here.
Hey, he was in trouble.
Ah, it’s so good.
Jïsa jïsa jïsa
You're welcome.
I will never see him again.
I am a street dog, remember?
And there is a rule.
She must marry the king.
- He deserves a king.
- He's a man!
I am a slow mover.
You are just an idiot
you leave me alone baby
Who are you?
A humble prisoner like you.
But together,
perhaps more than that.
I'm listening to you.
There’s a hole, baby, .
miraculous mountain,
it is full of wealth
beyond your wildest dreams.
Bagan!
It’s rich, it’s fascinating
your princess you bet.
Jafar, what a surprise?
I am dying for it.
But the rule is that it is only the king.
Hear the golden rule, .
Isn't that true ?
Anyone who has gold
sets the standards.
Why are you telling me all this
dear treasure with me?
I have a two legged puppy and.
suddenly behind to follow him.
That’s a problem.
There is a man there.
We are here to stay.
Um. Things don’t always work out like this

Hey, don’t worry too much, Abu.
He doesn't want to bite.
SARA SUPER (SUPER) ye.
Wait a minute. Don’t go to the gym.
Maybe you can help.
Hey! Oh!

So what is it, then?

¡Aaaaaaaahhhhh use it!

such a stubborn heart.
Please wait a little longer.
Oh! Oh!
Is that something that matters?

It’s nice to be back,
Brothers and sisters.
Hey. Where did you come from?
What is your name?
Er... Er, Aladin ye.
Aladdin is a brother. Greetings to Aladdin.
It’s great to have you on the show.
Did I call you "Ali"?
Or maybe it's just "Din".
Ja "Laddie"?
They'd say, "Here, boy. Come on, Laddie."
I was scratching my head
harder than I thought.
Do you smoke cigarettes? Would you mind if I did?
N b'i deli, Cheetah.
I hope I didn't burn the edges.
Oh, the Rugman guy. I don't think I saw you

Give me a pompom.
Yoo. Eh eh.
You have to say it's small

Or maybe even more so.

Jafar is a great city. Let’s drop everything
there are problems behind it.

Something good will come

When you are a queen, you feel
it’s hard to get rid of you.
It’s a nice sight.
So everything came together.

But she is a princess.
And to give us a chance, .
I have to be like that.
Hey, can you make me king?
Let's look at it here.
The king's meat? No.
Alaskan King Crab.
It’s there quite a bit. I hate it when they do that.
Caesar salad is the best. Ah!
Annie, Brute. Ayy.
Haha. "Make a king."
Is this what a soldier wants?
Say the magic words.
Genius, I need you
make me a king
Yelen!
Oh heh! So! So!
So far, this Fez and jacket combination
it belongs chiefly to the third century.
These adjustments.
What do you mean, beggar?
No, use me here.
So that’s a good thing. I really like this one. Very macho.
Now we need something else.
What does that tell me?
It’s about transportation.
Basi, jisk'a mono.
My. You.
- Oh no, I don't.
- Well, this is him.
What better way to do it yourself
into the streets of Agrabah
like riding alone
a new camel.
Hear. They’re dancing.
Mmmm. It is not necessary.
Wali ch'amawa.
Wait and see.
What do you have to do?
¡Joo!
Shimin Dumbo is the sword
Oh!
Talk about your bag.
Check out this exercise.
Abu, you look beautiful.

But we are not finished yet.
Hold on to your hat, baby.
We will make you a star.
Sir you have found the solution
your daughter’s problem.
Okay dear. There is a problem with your daughter.
What?
Akanah.
“The queen doesn’t have a choice
a man of a certain period, .
so the Sultan must act
you are here. »
But Jasmine hated it
all the suitors.
How could I choose
whom does he hate?
Don’t worry, sir.
There is something more.
“within the experience
we can't have a good king."
Naloma.
"Then the princess is getting married….
Hum. Tue.
Is there such a thing as that? WHICH?
The real show .
Well, that would be… for me.
But I thought the law forgave
it is the only king
can marry a princess.
I'm still learning...
Desperate times call
desperate measures, papa.
Than. Disappointing methods.
You will order it
the princess is marrying me
I ordered…
Saraman...
to give...
But you are too old.
The Princess will marry me.
The Princess is ready to be married…
- What. What is this?
Aka musicaxa.

Like many things, .

This is no ordinary lamp.

Once that changes

Diamonds are hard.

It starts on a very nice night, .

I was furious, so I put up with it.

Patience, in Iago. It's a lightweight.

Gazeem was like that

What are we going to do?
We have a big problem here, a big problem…

It's right.

So maybe he doesn't want to

Oooh ye! NAYA...

Allah has forbidden you to do so

Oh the princess.

So that is a good idea! Jafar, I'm sorry.

How can I help you?

The guards only took the boy

You can’t breathe, Jafar.

Why kidnap the princess, .

(SNIFFS) That's good.
I have a little need for you.

Sano inamaya sana
You are the boss again.

Hey, it’s just permanent slavery.

It’s very interesting.

Al, you won’t get another girl
a million years older than him.

Believe me, I know. I'm looking at it.

Jasmine, I love you so much, .

but I must stop being like myself
being something I am not.

I understand.

Genius, I want your freedom.

Get out of there
the royal line comes next.

- Is he there?
- Genius, you're free.

I am free to go. I am free to go.

Oh, does it taste good! I see!

I am free! I am finally free!

I almost hit the road.

A. I chose to.

I would choose you, Aladdin.

Call me Al.

Oh everyone, come here.
A group kiss.

Group embrace .

Do you mind if I kiss the monkey?

Oh the hair .

So it can’t get any worse
around this Popsicle.

I'm going to go!

Well, you two dark lovers!

Good morning, Rugman, ciao. I have a story.

No, I am a legend.
