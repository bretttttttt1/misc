1
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,720
#Oh, I come from a country
From a distant place#

2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,080
#Where the camels of the caravan roam#

3
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,640
#Where it is flat and immense
And the heat is intense#

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,120
#It’s barbaric but hey, it’s at home#

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,680
#When the wind comes from the east
And the sun comes from the west

6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,840
#And the sand in the glass is right#

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,880
#Come down, come see us
Jump on a mat and fly#

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,280
#Towards another Arab night#

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,880
#Arabian nights#

ten
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,520
#Like Arab days#

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,160
#Most of the time
Are hotter than hot#

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,680
#Many good manners#

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,080
#Arabian nights#

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,600
#'Neath Arab Moons#

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,600
#An unprepared fool
Could fall and fall hard#

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,160
#Over there, on the dunes#

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,320
Ah, Salaam and good evening
to you, worthy friend.

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
Please, please come closer.

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,080
Too close. A little too close.

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,600
There.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,040
Welcome to Agrabah,

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,480
mysterious city,

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,160
of enchantment,

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,960
and the best merchandise on this side
of the Jordan, on sale today.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
Look at this. Yes.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,760
Hookah and coffee maker combination.
Also makes julienne fries.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,960
Will not break. Will not...

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
It broke.

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,080
Ohh! Look at this.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,800
I've never seen
one of them was previously intact.

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,840
This is the famous
Tupperware from the Dead Sea.

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,440
Listen. Ah, still good.

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,920
Wait. Do not go.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,560
I can see you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,640
I think then you would be
most rewarded for considering this.

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Don't be fooled
by its banal appearance.

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,800
Like so many things,
it's not what's outside,

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,960
but what matters inside.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
This is no ordinary lamp.

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,560
Once it changed the course
of the life of a young man.

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,640
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than it seemed.

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,040
The diamond in the rough.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,280
Maybe you would
do you want to hear the story?

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,960
It begins with a dark night...

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,120
where a dark man waits

46
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,400
with a dark lens.

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,280
You are late.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,160
A thousand apologies, O Patient One.

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,360
Do you have it then?

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,840
I had to cut a few throats,
but I got it.

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,880
Ah-ah-ahhh.

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
The treasure.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,600
Ouch!

54
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,440
Trust me, my spicy friend.

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,560
- You will get what you expect.
- What's wrong. Awk!

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,480
Quickly! Follow the trail.

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,640
Faster.

58
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,600
Finally, after all
my years of research...

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,280
the Cave of Wonders.

60
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,520
Ok. Cave of Wonders.

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,080
By Allah.

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,080
Now remember.
Bring me the lamp.

63
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,880
The rest of the treasure
is yours, but the lamp is mine.

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,280
Oh, the lamp. Oh, the lamp.

65
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Damn, where did you dig
this bozo standing?

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,120
Shh.

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,160
Who disturbs my sleep?

68
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,640
It's me, Gazeem,

69
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,640
a humble thief.

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,360
Know this.

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,920
Only one can enter here,

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,560
the one whose value lies far away.

73
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,560
A diamond in the rough.

74
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,680
What are you waiting for#Continue.

75
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,800
No!

76
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,960
Looking for you
the rough diamond.

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,520
I can not believe it.
I just don't believe it.

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,640
We will never get
a take on that stupid lamp.

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,200
Forget that.
Look at this.

80
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm so angry I'm molting.

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,400
Patience, Lake. Patience.

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,080
Gazeem obviously wasn't worth it.

83
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,080
Oh, there's a big surprise.

84
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,600
I think I'm having a heart attack
and die from this surprise.

85
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,160
What are we going to do?
We have a big problem here, a big...

86
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Yes.

87
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,240
Only one can enter.

88
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,600
I have to find this one, this one...

89
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,240
rough diamond.

90
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,400
Stop! Thief!

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,240
Stop! Thief!

92
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,600
I will have your hands
for a trophy, street rat.

93
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,280
All that for a loaf of bread?

94
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,920
Wow!

95
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,760
- Here it is!
- You won't get out of this so easily!

96
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,800
Do you think it was easy?

97
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,800
You two, over there,
and you, follow me.

98
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,120
- We'll find him.
- Hello ladies.

99
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,880
Getting into trouble a little early
today, isn't it, Aladdin?

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,680
Worry. Certainly not. You are only
in trouble if you get caught.

101
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,680
- I got you.
- I have problems.

102
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,120
And this time...

103
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,840
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

104
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,440
- Abu.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,080
#I gotta keep a jump
Ahead of the queue for bread#

106
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,160
#One step ahead of the sword#

107
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,720
#I only steal what I can't afford#

108
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,880
That's all.

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,600
#A step ahead of the lawmen#

110
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
#That's it and it's not a joke#

111
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,640
#These guys don't like that I'm broke#

112
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,880
- The scum.
- Street rat.

113
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,840
- Scoundrel.
- Take that.

114
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,720
#Just a little snack, guys#

115
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,480
#Tear It Up
Take it back, guys#

116
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,440
#I can understand a clue
I have to face the facts#

117
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,560
- #You are my only friend, Abu#
- WHO?

118
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,080
#Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom#

119
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,680
#He became a single man to increase crime#

120
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,560
#I would blame the parents
Except he doesn't have them#

121
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,320
#I have to eat to live
I have to steal to eat#

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,760
#I tell you everything
When I had time#

123
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,400
#A jump ahead of slowpokes
One step ahead of my loss#

124
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,720
#Next time I will use a pen name#

125
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,760
Here it is.

126
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,640
#A leap ahead of the hitmen
One step ahead of the herd#

127
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,320
#I think I'm going for a walk
Around the block#

128
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,240
- Stop, thief.
- Vandal.

129
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,840
- Abu!
- Scandal.

130
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,960
#Let's not be in too much of a hurry#

131
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,840
#But I think it's pretty tasty#

132
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,600
#I have to eat to live
I have to steal to eat#

133
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,360
#Otherwise we would get along well#

134
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,520
Fake.

135
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,000
Grab it!

136
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,960
He has a sword!

137
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,600
You are idiots.
We all have swords.

138
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,760
- #A jump ahead of the beating of hooves#
- Vandal!

139
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,600
- #A jump before the bump#
- Street rat!

140
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,520
- #One thing before the disaster#
- Scoundrel!

141
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,080
#They are fast, but I am much faster#

142
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,840
#There you go, I better throw my hand in#

143
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,200
# Wish me a safe landing
All I have to do is jump#

144
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,960
Yuck! Hey!

145
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,640
And now, esteemed effendi, we enjoy ourselves.

146
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,200
All right.

147
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,600
Yum yum!

148
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,400
Uh-oh.

149
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,760
Here. Keep on going. Take it.

150
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,040
Oh no. Eh?

151
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,160
On the way to the palace, I suppose.

152
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Another suitor for the princess.

153
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,560
- Get out of my way, you brats.

154
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,040
Hey!

155
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,680
If I were as rich as you,
I could indulge in certain manners.

156
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,600
Oh. I'm going to teach you some manners.

157
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,840
Look at that, Abu.

158
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,040
It's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.

159
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,560
Ooh!

160
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,480
You are a worthless street rat.

161
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,720
You were born a street rat,
you will die like a street rat,

162
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,800
and only your fleas will cry for you.

163
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,680
I'm not worth anything.

164
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,880
And I don't have fleas.

165
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,320
Come on, Abu.
Let's go home.

166
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,120
#Riffraff, street rat#

167
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,440
#I don't buy this#

168
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,120
#If only they looked closer#

169
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,200
#Would they see a poor boy#

170
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,920
#No, Sire#

171
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,240
#They would find out#

172
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,920
#There is so much more#

173
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,000
#Tome#

174
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,880
One day, Abu,
things will change.

175
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,800
We will be rich, live in a palace,

176
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,000
and I never had any problems at all.

177
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,200
I have never been so insulted.

178
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,920
Oh, Prince Ahmed.
You're not leaving that early, are you?

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,040
Good luck marrying her.

180
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,600
Oh! Jasmine.

181
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,800
Jasmine!

182
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,720
Jasmine!

183
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,720
- Jasmine!

184
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,840
It's fucked up, Rajah.

185
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
This is why Prince Ahmed
slammed.

186
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,520
Oh, Father.

187
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,320
Rajah was just playing with him.
Isn't that right, Rajah?

188
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,520
you were just playing
with that too dressed,

189
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,240
The egocentric Prince Ahmed,
is not it ?

190
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,360
Dearest, you need to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes calling.

191
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,120
The law says
you must be married to a prince...

192
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,080
before your next birthday.

193
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,560
The law is false.

194
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,800
You only have three days left.

195
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,360
Father, I hate being forced to do this.

196
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,600
If I get married,
I want it to be out of love.

197
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,760
Jasmine...

198
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,880
it's not just this law.

199
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:51,280
I'm not going to be here forever,
well, I...

200
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,880
I just want to be sure
you are taken care of.

201
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,280
Foreseen.

202
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,960
Please try to understand.

203
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,080
I've never done anything on my own.
I never had real friends.

204
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,800
Except you, Rajah.

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,200
I've never even been there
outside the palace walls.

206
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,640
But, Jasmine, you are a princess.

207
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,520
So maybe I don't want
be more of a princess.

208
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,320
Oooh! I...I...

209
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,360
Allah forbids you from doing so
have daughters.

210
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,840
Hmm?

211
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,360
I don't know where she got that from.

212
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,280
His mother wasn't that picky.

213
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,760
Oh! Ah, Jafar.

214
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,240
My most trusted advisor.

215
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
I desperately need your wisdom.

216
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,760
My life is only to serve you, my lord.

217
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,440
It's this business of suitors.

218
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,920
Jasmine refuses
choose a husband.

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,880
- I'm at the end of my nerves.
- Ah OK ! End of the rope!

220
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,720
Oh!

221
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,160
Have a biscuit, pretty Polly.

222
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,400
Your Majesty certainly
makes sense with stupid animals.

223
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,960
NOW,
maybe I can guess a solution

224
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,080
to this thorny problem.

225
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,680
If anyone can help, it's you.

226
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,680
But this would require the use
of the mystical blue diamond.

227
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,520
Oh. Uh, my ring?

228
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,880
But it's been in the family for years.

229
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,040
We need to find
the princess a suitor.

230
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,840
Don't worry.

231
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,440
Everything will be alright.

232
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,960
Everything will be alright.

233
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
The diamond.

234
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,520
Here, Jafar.

235
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,920
Everything you need will be fine.

236
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,600
You are very kind, my lord.

237
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,160
Now run and play
with your little toys, eh?

238
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,640
Yes. It will be pretty good.

239
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
I can not stand it anymore !

240
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,600
If I have to choke on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...

241
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Boom! Beat!

242
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,200
Calm down, Lago.

243
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,480
Then I grabbed him by the head.
Beat!

244
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,240
Soon I will be sultan,
not this stupid idiot.

245
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,480
And then I stuff the crackers
in his throat.

246
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,000
Ha, ha!

247
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,240
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

248
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,320
But I can't stay here
and let my life be lived for me.

249
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,280
I'll miss you.

250
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,080
Bye.

251
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,040
Okay, Abu. Go.

252
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Try that. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

253
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,040
Get your paws off that.

254
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Why you...

255
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,800
Get out of here,
you damned, dirty monkey!

256
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,880
Bye.

257
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,120
Well done, Abu.

258
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,320
Breakfast is served.

259
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,880
Pretty lady, buy a pot.

260
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,200
There is no finer pot in brass or silver.

261
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,640
Sugar dates.
Sweet dates and figs.

262
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,800
Sweet dates and pistachios.

263
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,600
Would the lady like a necklace?

264
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,120
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

265
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,520
Fresh fish!

266
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,000
We catch them, you buy them!

267
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,680
Oh no. I do not think so.

268
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,080
Oh!

269
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,960
Excuse me.

270
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm really, really sorry.

271
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,640
Wow.

272
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,560
Uh-oh.

273
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,600
Good morning. Good morning?

274
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,920
Oh, you must be hungry.

275
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
Here is.

276
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,680
You better be able to pay for that.

277
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,800
Pay?

278
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
No one steals my basket.

279
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,600
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I have no money.

280
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,040
- Thief!
- Please...

281
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,000
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the Sultan.

282
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,160
You know what
the penalty is for theft?

283
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,880
No! No, please!

284
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,840
Thank you sir.
I'm so glad you found it.

285
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,840
I looked for you everywhere.

286
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,920
- What are you doing?
- Play the game.

287
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,240
You know this girl ?

288
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,800
Unfortunately yes. She is my sister.

289
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,400
She's a little crazy.

290
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,160
She said she knew the Sultan.

291
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,960
She thinks the monkey is the sultan.

292
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,360
O wise Sultan, how can I serve you?

293
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,600
Tragic, isn't it?

294
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,600
But no harm is done.

295
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,400
Now come, sister.
It's time to go see the doctor.

296
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,840
Oh, hello, doctor.
How are you doing?

297
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,400
- No no no. Not this one.
- Come on, Sultan.

298
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,680
Eh. What?

299
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,040
Come back here, you little thieves!

300
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,680
With all my respect,
Your rottenness,

301
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,200
couldn't we just wait
for a real storm?

302
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,160
Save your breath, Lago. Faster.

303
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,800
Yes, oh mighty Evil One.

304
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,160
Gone, sands of time.

305
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Reveal me the one
who can enter the cave.

306
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,480
Yes! Yes!

307
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,840
Here it is.

308
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,200
My diamond in the rough.

309
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,680
It's him. It's the clown
We were waiting?

310
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,800
Let the guards extend it
an invitation to the palace, okay?

311
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
Swell.

312
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,120
Almost there.

313
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,480
I want to thank you
for arresting this man.

314
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,120
Uh, forget it.

315
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,360
So it's your first time
on the market, huh?

316
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
Is it so obvious?

317
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,160
Well, you kind of stand out.

318
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,400
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

319
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,960
Hmm. I learn fast.

320
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,480
Wow.

321
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,680
Hey.

322
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,640
Come on. This way.

323
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,640
Wow. Watch your head there.

324
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,240
Be careful.

325
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,000
Is this where you live?

326
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,160
Yeah. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

327
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,120
This looks fabulous.

328
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,280
Well, it's not much,
but there is a superb view.

329
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,040
Wow. The palace looks
Quite surprising, huh?

330
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh, it's wonderful.

331
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,920
I wonder what it would be like
it's as if I lived there,

332
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,360
and they have servants and servants.

333
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,960
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

334
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,400
It's better than here.

335
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,160
You're always looking for food
and dodge the guards.

336
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
You are not free to do
your own choices.

337
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,920
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...

338
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,160
...trap.

339
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,240
So where are you from?

340
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,840
What does it matter?

341
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,400
I ran away
and I won't go back.

342
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,960
Really. How come?

343
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,640
Why you...

344
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,800
My father forces me
to marry.

345
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,560
It's... it's horrible.

346
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,920
Abu!

347
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,120
What?

348
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,680
Abu says, uh...
it is not fair.

349
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,800
What?

350
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,200
- Oh that's right ?
- Yes, of course.

351
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,880
And Abu
do you have anything else to say?

352
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,320
Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.

353
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Oh man.

354
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,040
Hmm.

355
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,480
Tell him it's very nice.

356
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,040
There you are.

357
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,400
- They're after me! You?
- It was my father who must have sent them...

358
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,680
- Do you trust me?
- What?

359
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,640
- Do you trust me?
- Yes...

360
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,240
So jump!

361
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,760
We continue to cross paths,
Isn't that right, street rat?

362
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,520
Run! Go! Get out of here!

363
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,960
Take this thing away from me!

364
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,800
- This is the dungeon for you, boy.
- Let me go.

365
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,120
Let him go.

366
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,520
- Look here, men. A street mouse.

367
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,040
Let it go,
by order of the princess.

368
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,040
Princess Jasmine.

369
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,800
- Princess?
- Princess?

370
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,800
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.

371
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,520
It's not your problem.
Do as I command. Free him.

372
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,640
I will, princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.

373
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,480
- You will have to discuss it with him.
- Believe me, I will.

374
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,280
Jafar?

375
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,080
Oh, princess.

376
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,480
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

377
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,680
How can I be of help to you?

378
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,960
The guards just took a boy
of the market, on your orders.

379
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,120
Your father accused me
with the maintenance of peace in Agrabah.

380
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

381
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,960
I can't breathe, Jafar.

382
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,480
Why, by kidnapping the princess,
Of course.

383
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,800
If you could just...
Ah! It hurts!

384
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,440
He didn't kidnap me.
I ran away.

385
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,320
Oh dear.

386
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,520
Oh, how terribly upsetting.
If I had known...

387
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,760
What do you mean?

388
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,280
Unfortunately, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

389
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,760
Which sentence ?

390
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,720
The death.

391
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,680
- By beheading.
- No.

392
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,560
I am extremely sorry, princess.

393
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,200
How can you?

394
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
So how did it go?

395
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,280
I think she took it pretty well.

396
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,160
It's all my fault, Rajah.

397
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,720
- I didn't even know his name.

398
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,720
She was the princess.

399
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,040
I can not believe it.

400
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,360
I must have looked
so stupid for her.

401
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,720
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin!

402
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,080
Good morning!

403
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,760
Abu. Here.

404
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,920
Come on, help me out of this.

405
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,200
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.

406
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,080
Yeah yeah yeah.

407
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Don't worry.
I will never see her again.

408
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,520
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there is a law.

409
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
She must marry a prince.

410
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,840
- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!

411
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,880
I'm stupid.

412
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,760
You're just a fool
if you give up, boy.

413
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,040
Who are you?

414
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,400
A humble prisoner, like you.

415
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,280
But together,
maybe we can be more.

416
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,520
I listen.

417
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,400
There is a cave, my boy,
a cave of wonders,

418
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,480
full of treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

419
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,200
Ooh!

420
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,080
A treasure enough to impress even
your princess, I'll bet.

421
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,640
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I die here.

422
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,200
But the law says that only a prince can...

423
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,000
You've heard of the golden rule,
is not it ?

424
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,400
The one with the gold
makes the rules.

425
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,040
Why would you share all this
a wonderful treasure with me?

426
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,480
I need a young pair of legs and
a strong back to pursue him.

427
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,160
Um, one problem.

428
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,200
It is over there.
We are here.

429
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,840
Uh-uh. Things are not always
what they seem.

430
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,600
SO...

431
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,640
do we have a deal?

432
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,960
Oh, I don't know.

433
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,200
Who disturbs my sleep?

434
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,000
Uh, it's me, Aladdin.

435
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,880
Proceed.

436
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,840
Do not touch anything except the lamp.

437
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,000
Remember, my boy,
bring me the lamp first,

438
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,880
and then you will have to
have your reward.

439
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,640
Come on, Abu.

440
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,640
Can you watch this!

441
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,560
Just a handful of these things
would make me richer than the sultan.

442
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,400
Abu!

443
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,200
Don't... touch... anything.

444
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,880
We need to find this lamp.

445
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,280
Eh?

446
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,080
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you stop him?

447
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,680
Abu, what are you, crazy?

448
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,800
A magic carpet.

449
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,160
Come on. To go out.
We're not going to hurt you.

450
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,440
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not going to bite.

451
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,720
THANKS.

452
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,520
Wait a minute. Do not go.

453
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,440
Maybe you can help us.

454
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,080
Hey! Wow!

455
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,640
You see, we try
to find this lamp.

456
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,880
I think he knows where it is.

457
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,600
Wait here.

458
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,880
Oh!

459
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,520
That's it?

460
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,840
This is what we came for
all the way here to...

461
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,760
Abu! No!

462
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,200
- Infidels!
- Oh oh.

463
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,120
You touched
the forbidden treasure!

464
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,320
Now you'll never do it again
see the day !

465
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,080
Wow!

466
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,680
Help! Help! Help!

467
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,160
I got you!

468
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,640
Carpet, let's move.

469
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,640
Abu!

470
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,680
Abu, now is not the time to panic.

471
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,680
Start panicking.

472
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Wow!

473
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,720
- Help me.
- Throw me the lamp.

474
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,240
I can't hold on.
Give me your hand.

475
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,040
Give me the lamp first.

476
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,800
Yes!

477
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,200
Finally!

478
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,560
What are you doing?

479
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,040
Give you your reward.

480
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,840
Your eternal reward.

481
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,200
It's mine.

482
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,600
It's all mine.

483
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,320
I... where is he?

484
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,560
No.

485
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,640
No!

486
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,280
Jasmine?

487
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,440
Oh my dear.

488
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,120
What's wrong?

489
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,560
Jafar has...

490
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,920
did something terrible.

491
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,680
There, there, my dear.

492
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,040
We will make things right.

493
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,480
Now tell me everything.

494
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,880
Oh.

495
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,440
Aladdin. Wake up.

496
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,080
Aladdin.

four hundred ninety seven
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,840
Oh! My head.

498
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,080
Were trapped.

499
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,080
This two-faced son of a jackal!

500
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,760
Whoever he is,
he's been gone a long time with that lamp.

501
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,960
Ah!

502
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,680
Well, you hairy little thief.

503
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,240
It looks like such a beating,
worthless junk.

504
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,680
Hey, I think there is
something written here,

505
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,920
but it's difficult to understand.

506
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,600
Aaaaahhhhh!

507
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,760
Hey!

508
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,320
10,000 years will give you
such a stiff neck.

509
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,760
Wait a second.

510
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,720
Wow! Wow!

511
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,680
Does it feel good
be out of there.

512
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Glad to be back,
Ladies and gentlemen.

513
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,960
Hi. Where do you come from?
What is your name?

514
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,440
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

515
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,320
Aladdin. Hello Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

516
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,360
Can we call you "Al"?
Or maybe just “Din”.

517
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,000
And “Laddie”?
They'd say, "Here, boy. Come on, Laddie."

518
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,600
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

519
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,480
Do you smoke? Do you mind if I do?

520
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,040
Oh, sorry, Cheetah.
I hope I didn't burn the fur.

521
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,760
Yo, Rugman. I did not see you
in a few millennia.

522
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,280
Give me some pompom.
Yeah. Eh eh.

523
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,720
Say, you are much smaller
as my last master.

524
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,160
Or maybe I'm getting bigger.
Look aside. Do I look different?

525
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,200
Wait a minute.
I am your master ?

526
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,120
That's right. He can be educated.
What would you wish for me?

527
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,400
The always impressive,

528
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,200
long content,

529
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,560
often imitated,

530
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,520
but never duplicated...

531
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Duplicated, duplicated...

532
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,160
Genius...

533
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,480
of the Lamp!

534
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,280
Right here, straight from the lamp,

535
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,640
right here for your
lots of wish fulfillment.

536
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,040
THANKS.

537
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,720
Wow. Wish fulfillment?

538
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,160
Three wishes to be exact.

539
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,880
And ix-no on the wish
for more wishes.

540
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,720
That's it. Three.
Uno, dos, tres.

541
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,000
No substitutions,
exchanges or refunds.

542
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,200
Now I know I'm dreaming.

543
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,200
Master, I don't think you really realize
what you have here.

544
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,440
So why not just ruminate

545
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,360
while I shine
the possibilities.

546
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,760
#Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves#

547
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,560
#Scheherazade had a thousand stories#

548
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,440
#But, master, you are lucky
Because you rolled up your sleeves#

549
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,800
#You have a brand of magic that never fails#

550
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,160
#You have power in your corner now#

551
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,440
#Some heavy ammunition in your camp#

552
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,880
#You got punch and punch
Yahoo and how#

553
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,480
#See, all you have to do
It's rub this lamp and I'll say#

554
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,800
#Mr. Aladdin, sir,
What will be your pleasure#

555
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,240
#Let me take your order
Rate it#

556
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,120
#You never had a friend like me#

557
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,240
#Life is your restaurant
And I'm your butler

558
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,960
#Come on, whisper whatever you want#

559
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,920
#You never had a friend like me#

560
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,480
#Yes sir
We pride ourselves on service#

561
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,640
#You are the boss, the king, the shah#

562
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,360
#Say what you want
It's yours, real dish#

563
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,920
#How about some more baklava#?

564
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,200
#Have some of Column A
Try the whole column B#

565
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,840
#I'm in the mood to help you, man#

566
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,080
#You never had a friend like me#

567
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,840
#Oh my#

568
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,040
#No no#

569
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,360
#Oh dear#

570
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,280
#Can your friends do this#?

571
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,200
#Can your friends do this#?

572
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
#Can your friends shoot this#

573
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,160
#He took out his little hat#?

574
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,560
#Can your friends go poof#?

575
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,240
Hey, look here. Haha!

576
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,720
#Can your friends go
Abracadabra, let it rip#

577
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,040
#And then make that sucker disappear#

578
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,600
#So don't just sit there
Soft jaw, wild eyes#

579
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,920
#I am here to answer
All your midnight prayers#

580
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,840
#You have certified me in good faith#

581
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,200
#You are a genius
For your business manager#

582
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,560
#I have a strong desire to help you#

583
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,040
#So what is your wish
I really want to know#

584
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,720
#You have a list
It's probably three miles long#

585
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,920
#All you have to do is rub like this#

586
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,680
#Mr. Aladdin, sir
I have a wish or two or three#

587
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,120
#I'm at work, big mogul#

588
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,120
#You never had a friend
I never had a friend#

589
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,360
#You never had a friend
I never had a friend#

590
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,640
#You never are#

591
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,920
#I had a#

592
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,240
#Friend#

593
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
#As#

594
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,240
#Me#

595
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,400
Ah ha ha!

596
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,920
Wah ha ha!

597
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,720
#You never had a friend like me#

598
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,440
Eh?

599
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,560
So what's it going to be, Master?

600
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,800
You will grant me
three wishes I want, right?

601
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,280
Oh, almost.

602
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,160
There are some reservations,
some compensations.

603
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,200
As?

604
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,600
Ah, rule number one:
I can't kill anyone.

605
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,880
So don't ask.

606
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,280
Rule number two.

607
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,200
I can't make anyone
fall in love with someone else.

608
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,200
You're a little punisher there.

609
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,400
Rule number three. I can't bring
people come back from the dead.

610
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,600
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing that.

611
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,880
Other than that, you have it.

612
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,680
- Hmm.
- Oh!

613
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,680
Reserves ?
Do you mean the limits?

614
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
On wishes?
An all-powerful genius.

615
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,240
I can't even bring people
back from the dead.

616
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,840
I don't know, Abu. It is probably
I can't even get us out of this cave.

617
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,040
Looks like we're going to have to
find a way out.

618
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,000
Excuse me?

619
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,920
Are you looking at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

620
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,680
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

621
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,680
And you let me down?

622
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,840
I do not think so,
not immediately.

623
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
You get your wishes,
so sit down!

624
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,480
- In case of emergency,

625
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,800
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

626
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,400
Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.

627
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,360
Were...

628
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,880
out of here!

629
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,280
Jafar, it's a scandal.

630
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,240
If it wasn't for all your years
good and loyal service...

631
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,200
From now on you need to discuss
condemnation of the prisoners with me,

632
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,720
before they were decapitated.

633
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,640
I assure you, Your Highness,
this won't happen again.

634
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,920
Jasmine...

635
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,880
Jafar. Let's put it all
complicated matters behind us.

636
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,000
Please.

637
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,000
My most abject and humble apologies
you too, princess.

638
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,200
At least some good will come
that I was forced to marry.

639
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,240
When I am queen, I will have
the power to get rid of you.

640
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,440
It's good.
So everything was settled.

641
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,600
Now, Jasmine, let's get back to
this suitor thing...Jasmine?

642
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,760
Jasmine!

643
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,360
If only I had had this lamp.

644
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,560
"I will have the power
to get rid of you. »

645
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,520
Think
we have to keep kissing

646
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,400
to this idiot
and his stupid daughter

647
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,040
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, Lake.

648
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,560
Only until she finds
a stupid husband.

649
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,440
Then she'll get us banned.

650
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,000
Or beheaded.

651
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,920
Eww!

652
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,840
Oh. Wait a minute.

653
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,760
Jafar. And if you were
the idiot husband?

654
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,920
What?

655
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,400
Okay, you're getting married
princess, okay?

656
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,080
And, uh, then you
become the sultan.

657
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,440
Oh.

658
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,960
Marry the shrew.

659
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,360
I become the sultan.

660
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,320
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, it deserves it. Yes.

661
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:56,040
And then we let stepfather down
and the little woman on the edge of a cliff.

662
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,560
Yeah !

663
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Kersplat!

664
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,280
I like the way
your dirty little mind works.

665
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,640
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

666
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,320
Don't stand to the mat
is completely stopped.

667
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,360
THANKS.
Goodbye now. Good yes.

668
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,480
THANKS.

669
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,480
Well how about this,
M. Do you doubt Mustafa?

670
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,200
Oh, you showed me that well.
Now, about my three wishes.

671
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,360
Are my ears deceiving me?

672
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,760
Three. You're one point behind, boy.

673
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,440
Oh no. I never really wished
to get out of the cave.

674
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,200
You did it alone.

675
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,920
Well, I feel sheepish.

676
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,120
Alright, you baaad boy,
but no more gifts.

677
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,360
Fair exchange.
So three wishes.

678
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,360
I want them to be good.

679
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,080
What would you like?

680
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,040
Me?

681
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,240
No one has ever asked me that before.

682
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,120
Well, in my case...
Ah, forget it.

683
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,080
- What?
- No I can not. I...

684
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,360
Come on. Tell me.

685
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,520
Freedom.

686
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,400
Are you a prisoner?

687
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,840
All this is an integral part
of the whole concert of genius.

688
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,480
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

689
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,880
A very small living space.

690
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,040
Genius, this is terrible.

691
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,520
But, oh, to be free.

692
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,840
No need to go there,
“Phew. What do you need?

693
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,480
Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

694
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,360
To be my own master.

695
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,080
Such a thing would be
greater than all magic

696
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,720
and all the treasures
In the whole world.

697
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,600
But what am I talking about?
Let's be real here.

698
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,040
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

699
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,200
Genius, wake up and smell the hummus.

700
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,560
Why not?

701
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,320
The only way for me to get out
that's if my master wants me to leave.

702
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,680
So you can guess how often
it happened.

703
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,400
I will do it. I will free you.

704
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,640
- Uh-huh, yeah, that's true.
- No, really, I promise.

705
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,440
after making my first two wishes,

706
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,680
I will use my third wish
to free you.

707
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,760
Well, I hope so.
All right.

708
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,080
Let's make magic.

709
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,760
So what is it?
What do you want most?

710
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,520
Well, there's this girl.

711
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,840
Fake.

712
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,360
I can't make anyone
falling in love, remember?

713
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,840
Oh, but, Genius,

714
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,720
she's smart and fun and...

715
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,680
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

716
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,160
She has these eyes that...
and that hair. Wow.

717
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,480
And his smile...

718
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,760
Am I.

719
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,880
It's love.

720
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
But she's the princess.

721
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,920
To even have a chance,
I should be...

722
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,800
Hey, can you make me a prince?

723
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,320
Let's see here.

724
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,080
Royal chicken? No.

725
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,240
Alaskan king crab.
Ouch. I hate it when they do that.

726
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,840
Cesar salad. Ah!
And you, Brute. No.

727
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,000
Haha. “Make a prince.”

728
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,200
Is this an official wish?
Say the magic words.

729
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,000
Genius, I wish you
to make me a prince.

730
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,680
All right!

731
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,040
Eh eh ! Frame! Frame!

732
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,320
First up, this fez and vest combo
it's too much of the third century.

733
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,680
These fixes.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

734
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,160
No, let's work with me here.

735
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Ooh. I like this. Very macho.

736
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,040
Now he needs something else.
What does that tell me?

737
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,800
It's about mode of transportation.

738
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,600
Excuse me, little monkey.
Whose. This way.

739
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,520
- Oh oh.
- Well here he is.

740
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,560
What better way to make your
entering the streets of Agrabah

741
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,360
than riding alone
brand new camel.

742
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,600
Attention. They spit.
Mmmm. Not enough.

743
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,800
It's still not enough.

744
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,560
Let's see.
What do you need?

745
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,160
Yes!

746
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,480
Esalalumbo Shimin Dumbo.

747
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,480
Wow!

748
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,560
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action.

749
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,480
Abu, you look good.

750
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,960
He has the outfit.
He has the elephant.

751
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,920
But we're not done yet.

752
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,440
Hold on to your turban, kid.
We're going to make you a star.

753
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,480
Sir, I found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

754
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,000
Ok. The problem with your daughter.

755
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,240
Oh really?

756
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,400
Here.

757
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,280
"If the princess has not chosen
a husband at the appointed time,

758
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,560
then the sultan will have to
choose for her. »

759
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,360
But Jasmine hated
all these suitors.

760
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,560
How could I choose
someone she hates?

761
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,480
Don't worry, my lord.
There is more.

762
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,360
"if in the event
we cannot find a suitable prince,"

763
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,400
Jerk.

764
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,320
"a princess must then be married to..."

765
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,680
Hmm. Interesting.

766
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,440
What? WHO?

767
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,080
The royal vizier.

768
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,520
Well, that would be... me.

769
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,280
But I thought the law said

770
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,600
that only a prince
can marry a princess.

771
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,120
I'm pretty sure...

772
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,920
Desperate times call
desperate measures, my lord.

773
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,040
Yes. Desperate measures.

774
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,080
You will order
the princess to marry me.

775
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,320
I will order...

776
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,000
Princess...

777
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,200
has...

778
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,600
But you are so old.

779
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,960
The princess will marry me.

780
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,600
The princess is getting married...

781
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,360
- What. What is this?

782
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,760
This music.

783
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,760
Jafar, you must come
and see this.

784
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,960
#Make way for Prince Ali#

785
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,280
#Say hello#

786
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,560
#It's Prince Ali#

787
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,560
#Hey, lead the way in the old bazaar#

788
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,280
#Hey you, let us pass
It's a new shining star#

789
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,480
#Oh come on, be the first in your neighborhood
To meet his gaze#

790
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,840
#Make way, here it is
Ring the bells, bang the drums#

791
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,440
#You're going to love this guy#

792
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,840
#Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa#

793
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,280
#Genuflect, show respect
On your knees#

794
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,640
#Now do your best to stay calm#

795
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,240
#Refresh your Sunday salaam#

796
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,880
#So come and meet
His spectacular coterie#

797
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,720
#Prince Ali, powerful is he,
Ali Ababwa#

798
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,640
#Strong like ten ordinary men, definitely#

799
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,440
#He galloped against the hordes#

800
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,680
#A hundred bad guys with swords#

801
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,560
#Who sent these morons to their lords
Why, Prince Ali#

802
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,240
#He has 75 golden camels#

803
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,720
Aren't they lovely, June?

804
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,320
#Purple peacocks, he has 53#

805
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,200
Fabulous, Harry.
I love feathers.

806
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,800
#When it comes to exotic type mammals#

807
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,120
#Does it have a zoo
I tell you#

808
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,640
#It's a world-class menagerie#

809
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,400
#Prince Ali, he is handsome
Ali Ababwa#

810
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,160
#This physique, how can I speak
Weak knee#

811
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,920
#Well, get out there#

812
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
#Adjust your veil and get ready#

813
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,040
#To gape, crawl and stare
At Prince Ali#

814
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,800
- #He has 95 white Persian monkeys#
- #He has the monkeys#

815
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,920
- #Let's see the monkeys#
- #And to see them, it does not charge any fees#

816
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,240
#He has slaves
He has servants and minions#

817
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,000
#Proud to work for him
They bow to his whims, love to serve him#

818
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,120
#They just suck at loyalty to Ali#

819
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,080
#Prince Ali#

820
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:41,040
#Prince Ali, he is in love
Ali Ababwa#

821
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,560
#I heard your princess
It was a pleasant sight to see#

822
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,880
#And that, good people, is why#

823
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,560
#He got dressed and went over#

824
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,360
#With 60 elephants, llamas galore#

825
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,360
#With the bears and the lions,
A fanfare and more#

826
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,240
#With its 40 fakirs,
Its cooks, its bakers#

827
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,640
#His birds chirping on the sidelines#

828
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,760
#Make way#

829
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,880
#For Prince Ali#

830
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,240
Splendid.
Absolutely wonderful.

831
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,520
Your Majesty,

832
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,400
I have traveled far and wide
look for your daughter's hand.

833
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,400
Prince Ali Ababwa.

834
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,000
Of course.
Nice to meet you.

835
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,160
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He too is delighted.

836
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,360
Ecstatic.

837
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,120
- I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...
-Ababwa.

838
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,480
Never mind.

839
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,400
You can't just scroll here
uninvited and expect...

840
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,640
By Allah, it is absolutely
a remarkable device.

841
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,160
Ooh.

842
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,720
I don't think I could...

843
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,320
Well, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.

844
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,360
Sire, I must advise you against this.

845
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,560
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

846
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,120
AIE Aie Aie.

847
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,400
Ahh! Wow!

848
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,920
Where did you say
where were you from?

849
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,800
Oh, much further than
you have traveled, I am sure.

850
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,760
- Try me.
- Be careful, Polly.

851
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,800
Hey, check this out.

852
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,920
Look at him with that stupid rug.

853
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,880
Ah!

854
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,920
Phew!

855
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,520
Out of the way.
I'm coming to land.

856
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,000
Jafar, look at this.

857
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,320
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- It was lovely.

858
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,240
Yes, it seems to me
have a talent for it.

859
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,560
This is a very impressive youth.

860
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,920
And a prince at that.

861
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,400
If we're lucky, you won't
I have to marry Jasmine after all.

862
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,080
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- It's absurd.

863
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,240
There is one thing I am proud of, Jafar,

864
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,240
I am an excellent judge of character.

865
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,240
Oh, excellent judge.
Yes of course. Not!

866
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,360
Jasmine will like this one.

867
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,840
And I'm pretty sure
I would like Princess Jasmine.

868
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,600
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on behalf of Jasmine.

869
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,720
This boy is no different
others.

870
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,640
What makes him think
Is he worthy of the princess?

871
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,480
Your Majesty,
I am Prince Ali Ababwa.

872
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,720
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

873
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,160
How dare you.

874
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,000
You all. Standing around
decide on my future?

875
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,760
I am not a prize to be won.

876
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,200
Oh dear.

877
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,600
Don't worry, Prince Ali.

878
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,200
Just give Jasmine some time
cool.

879
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,320
I think it's time to say goodbye
to Prince Abouboo.

880
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,840
What will I do?

881
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,000
Jasmine won't even do it
let me talk to him.

882
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,640
I should have known I couldn't get out of this
this stupid prince wishes.

883
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,360
So get moving.

884
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,320
Hey.

885
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,600
It's a good decision.

886
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,160
I can not believe it.
I lose to an all-in.

887
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,400
Genius, I need help.

888
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,440
Alright, Sparky,
here's the deal.

889
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,440
If you want to go to court
the little lady,

890
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,360
you have to be
a straight shooter.

891
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,280
- Did you get it?
- What?

892
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,400
Tell him...

893
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,240
-...truth!
- Certainly not.

894
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,960
If Jasmine found out I was really
a dirty street rat,

895
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,000
she would make fun of me.

896
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,440
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

897
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,480
Al, joking aside,
you really should be yourself.

898
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,480
Hey, that's the last thing I want to be.

899
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,440
Okay, I'll go see her.

900
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,960
I just... I have to be gentle,
cool, confident.

901
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,040
What do I look like?

902
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,280
Like a prince.

903
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,560
Princess Jasmine?

904
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,480
- Who is here?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

905
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,800
Hmm. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

906
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,520
I do not want to see you.

907
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,000
No, no, please, princess.
Give me a chance.

908
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,480
- Leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

909
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,960
So, how is our little friend?

910
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,640
Good kitty, take off.

911
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,120
Down, kitty.

912
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,200
Wait. Wait.

913
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,600
I know you?

914
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,000
Uh no. No.

915
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,200
You remind me of someone
I met in the market.

916
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,680
The marketplace?

917
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,520
I have servants who go
to the market for me.

918
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,600
Well, I even have servants who go to
the market for my servants.

919
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,800
It's not me you met.

920
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,360
No, I guess not.

921
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,920
Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.

922
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,640
She's smart, funny,
the hair, the eyes.

923
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,200
Nothing. Choose a feature.

924
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,080
Hmm. Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You are very...

925
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,360
- Wonderful, magnificent, punctual.
-...punctual.

926
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,520
- Punctual?
- Sorry.

927
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,800
- Um, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

928
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,880
Hmm.

929
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,080
I'm rich too, you know.

930
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,960
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.

931
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,960
I know.

932
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,520
A great price
for a prince to marry.

933
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,440
Um, that's true. RIGHT.
A prince like me.

934
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,640
Warning! Warning!

935
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,720
RIGHT. A prince like you.

936
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,160
And all the other plush shirts,
swaggering peacock I met.

937
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,760
Help! Help!

938
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,360
Just gonna jump
a balcony!

939
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,520
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!

940
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,840
- Do you want me to sting her?
- Get out.

941
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,400
OK very good.
But remember, “bee” yourself.

942
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,200
- Yes indeed.
- What?

943
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,400
Um... Um, you're right.

944
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,520
You are not only
a prize to be won.

945
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,280
You should be free
to make your own choice.

946
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,600
I will leave now.

947
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,440
- No!
- What? What?

948
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,720
How...

949
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,240
How do you do this?

950
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,800
- It's a flying carpet.
- It's adorable.

951
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,680
You, uh...

952
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,960
You don't want to go
for a ride, right?

953
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,200
We could leave the palace,
see the world.

954
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,320
- Is it safe?
- Of course. Do you trust me?

955
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,040
- What?
- Do you trust me?

956
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,480
Yes.

957
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:15,880
Yes.

958
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,560
#I can show you the world#

959
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,800
#Brilliant, shimmering, splendid#

960
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,400
#Tell me, princess#

961
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:45,200
#Now when was the last time you did
Let your heart decide#

962
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,080
#I can open my eyes#

963
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,360
#Take yourself wonder by wonder#

964
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,120
#Above, Sideways and Below#

965
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,920
#On a magic carpet#

966
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,680
#An entirely new world#

967
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,280
#A fantastic new point of view#

968
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,840
#No one to tell us no
Or where to go#

969
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,520
#Or let's say we're just dreaming#

970
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,280
#An entirely new world#

971
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,240
#A dazzling place
I never knew#

972
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,600
#But when I'm up there
It's crystal clear#

973
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,880
#That now I'm in
A whole new world with you#

974
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,160
#Now I'm in
A whole new world with you#

975
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,000
#Incredible sites#

976
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,480
#Indescribable feeling#

977
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,480
#Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling#

978
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,520
#Through an endless sky of diamonds#

979
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,000
- #An entirely new world#
- #Don't you dare close your eyes#

980
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,280
- #One hundred thousand things to see#
- #Hold your breath, it gets better#

981
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,720
#I'm like a shooting star
I came this far#

982
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,000
#I can't go back to where I was#

983
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,800
- #An entirely new world#
- #Every turn is a surprise#

984
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,520
- #With new horizons to pursue#
- #Every moment, red letter#

985
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,960
#I'll chase them anywhere
There is time to lose#

986
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,480
#Let me share
This whole new world with you#

987
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,360
- #An entirely new world#
- #An entirely new world#

988
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,240
- #This is where we will be#
- #This is where we will be#

989
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,960
- #A thrilling chase#
- #A wonderful place#

990
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,840
#For you and me#

991
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,120
- It's so magical.
- Yeah.

992
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,040
It's a shame
Abu must have missed this.

993
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,200
No. He hates fireworks.

994
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,200
He doesn't like to fly either.

995
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,000
Um, that is to say, uh...
Oh no.

996
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,160
You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.

997
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,640
- Why did you lie?
-Jasmine, I'm sorry.

998
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,560
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.

999
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,480
- That I wouldn't understand?
- No.

1000
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:16,160
I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

1001
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,160
Who are you?
Tell me the truth.

1002
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,000
The truth?

1003
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,360
The truth. Uh...

1004
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,720
The truth is...

1005
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,400
I sometimes dress like a commoner, uh...

1006
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,000
to escape the pressures
of palace life.

1007
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,520
But I really am a prince.

1008
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,000
Why didn't you tell me?

1009
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,640
Well you know...

1010
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,840
royalty comes out
in the city disguised,

1011
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,640
it seems a little strange,
you do not think ?

1012
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,320
Hmm.

1013
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,800
Not so strange.

1014
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,520
Good night, my handsome prince.

1015
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,280
Sleep well, princess.

1016
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,960
Yes!

1017
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,360
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go well.

1018
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,440
Abu. Abu.

1019
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,600
Hold it.

1020
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,480
I'm afraid you're exhausted
welcome, Prince Abooboo.

1021
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,960
Why you...

1022
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,160
Make sure it's never found.

1023
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,840
Never fail. Take the bath
and there is a problem with the lamp.

1024
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,360
Good morning? Al?

1025
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,000
Al! Kid, stop.

1026
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,600
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help you unless you make a wish.

1027
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,600
You must say: "Genius,
I want you to save my life." Understood?

1028
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,920
Come on, Aladdin!

1029
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,360
I take that as a yes.

1030
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,240
Superior reach.

1031
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,040
Don't scare me like that.

1032
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,600
Genius, I, uh...

1033
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,760
I...

1034
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,440
-Thank you, Genie.
- Oh, Al.

1035
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,640
I'm starting to like you, kid.

1036
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,240
It's not that I want to choose
curtains or anything.

1037
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,000
Jasmine.

1038
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,120
Oh, Father, I just had
the most wonderful moment.

1039
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,240
- I am so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

1040
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,600
I chose a husband for you.

1041
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,400
- What?
- You will marry Jafar.

1042
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,960
You are speechless, I see.

1043
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,840
A great quality in a wife.

1044
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,680
I will never marry you.

1045
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,360
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali is gone.

1046
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,600
Better check your
another crystal ball, Jafar.

1047
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,320
Prince Ali!

1048
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,960
How in the... uh. Awk!

1049
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,480
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

1050
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,560
What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.

1051
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,760
He's obviously lying.

1052
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,200
Obviously lying.

1053
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Father, what is wrong with you?

1054
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,080
I know what's wrong.

1055
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,120
Oh my!

1056
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,640
Jafar controls you with this.

1057
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,560
What? Jafar?

1058
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,520
You, traitor!

1059
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,720
Your Majesty,
all this can be explained.

1060
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,600
Guards! Guards!

1061
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,240
Well that's it.
Were dead. Forget that.

1062
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,400
Just dig a grave for both of us.
Were dead.

1063
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,800
Stop Jafar immediately.

1064
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,280
It's not done yet, boy.

1065
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,360
Find it!

1066
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,160
- Search everywhere!
-Jasmine, are you okay?

1067
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,160
Yes.

1068
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,520
Jafar, my most trusted advisor,

1069
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,600
plotting against me all this time.

1070
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,720
It's horrible, just horrible.

1071
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,960
How will I ever...

1072
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,960
Eh?

1073
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,720
Could this be true?

1074
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,280
My daughter finally
chosen a suitor?

1075
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,440
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!

1076
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,360
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.

1077
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,560
I will not do it.
I leave that to my...

1078
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,320
But you will be married at the same time.

1079
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,000
Yes yes. And you will be happy
and prosperous,

1080
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,160
and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

1081
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,560
-Sultan?
- Yes.

1082
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,680
A beautiful, honest young man
like you,

1083
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,120
a person of yours
impeccable moral character

1084
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,560
This is exactly what this kingdom needs.

1085
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,120
We have to get out of here.

1086
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,480
I need to start packing.
Only the essentials.

1087
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,840
We have to travel light.

1088
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,720
Bring the guns, the weapons,
and what do you think of this photo?

1089
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,480
I think I'm making a weird face with that.

1090
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,680
Oh man. It's cracked.
He became crazy.

1091
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,800
Jafar! Jafar!

1092
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,200
Have a grip!

1093
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,080
Good adhesion.

1094
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,920
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged kid, Aladdin.

1095
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,120
- He has the lamp, Lago.
- Well, this wretch...

1096
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,840
But you will
to relieve him.

1097
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,840
Me?

1098
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,440
Sultan?

1099
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,560
They want me to be Sultan?

1100
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,560
Huzzah!

1101
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,280
#Hail to the conquering hero#

1102
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,480
Aladdin, you just won
the heart of the princess.

1103
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,560
What are you going to do next?

1104
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,120
Psst. Your line is,
"I'm going to release the genie."

1105
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
Anytime.

1106
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,520
- Genius. I can't.
- Sure you can.

1107
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,960
Go ahead,
“Genius, I wish you freedom.”

1108
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,040
I'm serious.

1109
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,960
Listen, I'm sorry. I am really.
But they want to make me a sultan.

1110
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,520
No, they want to do
Prince Ali Sultan.

1111
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,800
Without you,
I'm just Aladdin.

1112
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,920
- Al, you win.
- Because of you.

1113
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,280
The only reason we think
I'm worth everything, it's because of you.

1114
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,440
And if they find out
I'm not really a prince?

1115
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,280
What if Jasmine found out?
I would lose it.

1116
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,480
Genius, I can't
keep it up for myself.

1117
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,200
I can't wish you freedom.

1118
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,960
GOOD. I understand.
You lied to everyone.

1119
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,720
Hey, I was starting to feel left out.

1120
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,200
Now, if you will excuse me, Master.

1121
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,800
Genius, I'm so sorry.

1122
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,520
GOOD.
So stay in there.

1123
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,400
What are you guys looking at?

1124
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,520
Look, I... I'm sorry.

1125
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,560
Abu, I'm sorry. I do not have...

1126
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,560
Wait. Come on.

1127
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,160
What am I doing?

1128
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,680
The genius is right.

1129
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,160
I have to tell Jasmine the truth.

11:30 a.m.
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,440
Ali. Oh, Ali.
Will you come here?

1131
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,800
Well, there it is.

1132
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,960
Jasmine?
Where are you?

1133
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,720
In the menagerie. Hurry up.

1134
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,760
I'm coming.

1135
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,320
Do you have a problem, Pinky?

1136
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,040
Jerk.

1137
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,440
Boy, Jafar will be happy to see you.

1138
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,320
- Excellent work, Lago.
- Oh, continue.

1139
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,320
Not really. On a scale of
one to ten, you are an eleven.

1140
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,760
Oh, Jafar, you are so kind.

1141
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,680
I am embarrassed.
I'm blushing.

1142
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,520
People of Agrabah,

1143
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,560
my daughter finally
chose a suitor.

1144
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,000
Jasmine.

1145
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,960
Ali, where have you been?

1146
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,200
Jasmine, there is something
I have to tell you.

1147
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,120
The whole kingdom has turned around
for the announcement of the Father.

1148
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,400
No, but, Jasmine, please listen to me.

1149
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,400
- You do not understand...
- Good luck.

1150
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,200
...Ali Ababwa!

1151
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,880
Oh man.

1152
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,520
Look at them,
applauding this little pipsqueak.

1153
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:29,680
Let them clap.

1154
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,800
Let them clap.

1155
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,720
You know, Al, I'm really getting...

1156
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,200
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, Al's role

1157
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,440
will be played by a tall and dark
and sinister ugly man.

1158
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,240
- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.

1159
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,200
Genie, grant me my first wish.

1160
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,960
I wish to reign on high as sultan.

1161
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,920
- Wow!
- Bless my soul.

1162
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,800
What is this?

1163
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,880
What is going on?
Oh, my God, what's happening?

1164
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,920
Father.

1165
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,000
Jafar, you vile traitor.

1166
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,920
For you, it's Sultan Vile Betrayer.

1167
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Oh yeah?
We'll just see about that.

1168
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,840
The lamp.

1169
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,160
Keepers of the finders, Abooboo.

1170
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,400
Genius, no!

1171
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,920
Sorry, kid.
I have a new master now.

1172
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,040
Jafar, I order you to stop.

1173
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,160
Ah, but there is a new order now.

1174
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,960
My command.

1175
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,960
Finally, you will bow to me.

1176
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,880
We will never bow to you.

1177
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,000
Why am I not surprised?

1178
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,440
If you don't bow to a sultan,

1179
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,560
then you will cower
in front of a wizard!

1180
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,840
Genius, my second wish...

1181
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,080
I wish to be the most powerful wizard
in the world!

1182
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,040
Genius, stop!

1183
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,920
Ladies and gentlemen,

1184
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,320
a warm welcome to Agrabah
for the sorcerer Jafar!

1185
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,280
Now where were we?

1186
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:25,800
Oh yes. An abject humiliation.

1187
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,920
Down there, boy.

1188
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,200
Oh, princess.

1189
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,040
There's someone I'm dying with
to present you.

1190
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,640
Jafar. Don't touch her.

1191
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,640
#PrinceAli
Yes it's him#

1192
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,760
#But not as you know it#

1193
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,880
#Read my lips
And face reality#

1194
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,960
#Yes, meet an explosion from your past#

1195
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,400
#Whose lies were too good to last#

1196
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,800
#Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali#

1197
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,360
Or should we say Aladdin?

1198
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,400
Ali?

1199
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,560
Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
I am fair...

1200
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,880
#So Ali turns out to be
Simply Aladdin#

1201
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,000
#Just a scam, shall I continue#

1202
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,280
#Take it from me#

1203
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,520
#His personality flaws#

1204
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,560
#Give me a valid reason#

1205
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,400
#To send him packing
On a one-way ticket#

1206
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,720
#So its prospects
Take a terminal dive#

1207
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:23,760
#His frozen assets, the chosen location
It's the end of the earth, whoopee!#

1208
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,120
- So long!
- Goodbye see you soon.

1209
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:30,040
#Ex-Prince Ali#

1210
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,640
Abu.

1211
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,760
Abu!

1212
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,680
Oh, this is all my fault.

1213
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,760
I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance. Abu.

1214
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,160
- Do you agree?
- Mm-hmm.

1215
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,080
I'm sorry, Abu.

1216
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,760
I messed it up.

1217
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,280
One way or another... I have to go back
and make things right.

1218
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,720
Carpet.

1219
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,240
Abu, start digging.

1220
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,360
That's it.

1221
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,800
Yeah! All right!

1222
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,640
Now, back to Agrabah.
Let's go.

1223
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,040
The puppet leader wants a cracker?

1224
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,800
Here's your cracker.
Pushed to the back of the throat.

1225
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,120
Here. Have plenty.

1226
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,680
Stop that.
Jafar, leave him alone.

1227
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,560
It hurts me to see you
reduced to that, Jasmine.

1228
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,760
A beautiful desert bloom
like you

1229
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,520
should be on the arm most
powerful man in the world.

1230
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,440
What do you say, my darling?

1231
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,160
Why, with you as queen...

1232
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,200
Never.

1233
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,840
I'm going to teach you some respect.

1234
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,600
No, Genie.

1235
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,040
I've decided
to make my last wish.

1236
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,000
I wish Princess Jasmine

1237
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,920
to fall desperately
in love with me.

1238
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,320
Ah, Master, there are some additions,
compensation...

1239
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,360
Don't answer me,
you big blue thug.

1240
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,240
What will you do
I order you to do it, slave.

1241
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,160
Jafar.

1242
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:22,880
I never realized how much...
you are incredibly beautiful.

1243
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,120
Mmmm. It's better.

1244
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,760
Now, kitty...

1245
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,720
tell me more about myself.

1246
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,680
You are tall...

1247
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,000
dark...

1248
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,000
well dressed...

1249
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,320
Al. Al, boyfriend.

1250
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,840
Shh.

1251
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,560
Al, I can't help you.

1252
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,280
I work for Señor Psychopath now.
What are you going to do?

1253
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:56,240
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'm going to improvise.

1254
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,720
...nice little gaps
between your teeth.

1255
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,640
Keep on going.

1256
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,160
And your beard...

1257
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,240
is so... twisted.

1258
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,400
- You stole my heart.
-Jaf...!

1259
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,000
- And the street rat?

1260
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,720
What street rat?

1261
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,080
Yeah !

1262
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,280
It was...

1263
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,400
You!

1264
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,560
How many times
should I kill you, my boy?

1265
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,880
Get the lamp.

1266
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,880
No!

1267
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,520
Ah, ah, ah, princess.
Your time is up.

1268
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,200
Jasmine.

1269
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,880
Oh, nice photo, Jaf...

1270
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,680
Do not play with me.

1271
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,120
Abu!

1272
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:07,400
Things are falling apart
hurry now, my boy.

1273
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,800
Get the point?

1274
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,120
I'm just warming up.

1275
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,520
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

1276
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,400
A snake, right?

1277
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:33,080
Maybe you would like to see
how much I can look like a snake.

1278
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,960
#Rick'em, rack'em, rock'em, rake
Stick that sword in that snake#

1279
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,520
Stay out of it.

1280
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,840
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... that's fine!

1281
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,520
Aladdin.

1282
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,840
Jasmine, wait.

1283
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,960
You little idiot.

1284
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,120
You thought you could win
the most powerful being on Earth.

1285
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:28,280
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze it like a... Awk!

1286
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:32,200
Without the genius, my boy,
you are nothing.

1287
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,320
The genius. The genius.

1288
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,120
Genius has more power
that you will never have.

1289
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,200
What?

1290
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,560
He gave you your power.
He can take it off.

1291
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,240
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?

1292
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,920
Admit it, Jafar.
You're still only in second place.

1293
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,240
You're right.

1294
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,960
His power exceeds mine.

1295
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,040
But not for long.

1296
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:59,120
The boy is crazy.
He's a little drunk on punch.

1297
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,720
One shot too many with the snake.

1298
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,560
Slave, I make my third wish.

1299
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,720
I wish to be
an all-powerful genius!

1300
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,880
Very well, your wish is my command.
Well done, Al.

1301
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,240
Yes.

1302
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,040
Yes!

1303
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,680
The power.

1304
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:33,400
Absolute power!

1305
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,560
- What have you done?
- Trust me.

1306
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,560
The universe belongs to me,
control!

1307
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,280
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1308
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,520
- Eh?
- You wanted to be a genius...

1309
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,840
you got it.

1310
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,120
What?

1311
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,440
And everything that goes with it.

1312
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,920
- No! No!
- I'm getting out of here.

1313
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,920
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

1314
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
You are the genius. I do not want...

1315
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,320
A very small living space.

1316
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,480
Al, you little genius, you.

1317
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,720
Ahh!

1318
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,200
Take your damn mouth
out of my face.

1319
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,400
- Oh, shut up, moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1320
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,720
Allow me.

1321
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,000
10,000 years in a cave of wonders
that should calm him down.

1322
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:35,120
Shut up!

1323
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,960
Jasmine...

1324
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:45,400
I'm sorry for lying to you
about being a prince.

1325
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,000
I know why you did it.

1326
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,640
Well, I guess...

1327
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,560
Is this goodbye?

1328
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,720
Oh, this stupid law.
It is not fair.

1329
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,360
I love you.

1330
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,200
Al, no problem.

1331
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,160
You still have one wish left.

1332
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,360
Just say the word
and you are a prince again.

1333
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,360
But, Genius,
what about your freedom?

1334
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,400
Hey, it's only
an eternity of servitude.

1335
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,360
It's love.

1336
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:16,640
Al, you won't find another girl
like her in a million years.

1337
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:20,400
Believe me, I know.
I watched.

1338
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,120
Jasmine, I love you,

1339
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,880
but I have to stop pretending
to be something that I am not.

1340
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,160
I understand.

1341
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,760
Genius, I wish for your freedom.

1342
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,800
A real
the prince's pedigree is forthcoming.

1343
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,600
- What?
- Genius, you are free.

1344
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,680
I'm free. I'm free.

1345
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,160
Fast. Fast.
Wish for something extraordinary.

1346
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,360
Say: “I want the Nile.” Try this.

1347
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,120
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- Certainly not!

1348
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,080
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

1349
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:15,280
I'm free! I'm finally free!

1350
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,720
I'm hitting the road.
I'm going to see the world.

1351
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,480
I am...

1352
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,440
Genius, I am...

1353
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,000
I'll miss you.

1354
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,240
Me too, Al.

1355
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:37,280
Never mind
what someone says,

1356
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,280
you will always be a prince to me.

1357
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,400
That's right.

1358
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,280
You have certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.

1359
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,640
It's this law
This is the problem.

1360
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,840
- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

1361
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,440
From this day on,

1362
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,000
the princess will get married
the one she deems worthy.

1363
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,440
Him. I choose...

1364
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:04,880
I choose you, Aladdin.

1365
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,760
Call me Al.

1366
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,240
Oh, all of you, come here.
A big group hug.

1367
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,840
Group hug.

1368
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,800
Do you mind if I kiss the monkey?

1369
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,120
Ooh, furball.

1370
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,120
Well I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.

1371
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,080
I am leaving!

1372
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,480
Goodbye, you two crazy lovebirds!

1373
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,280
Hey, Rugman, ciao.
I am the story.

1374
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,840
No, I am mythology.

1375
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,800
I don't care what I am. I'm free!

1376
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,120
#An entirely new world#

1377
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,600
#A whole new life#

1378
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,160
#For you and me#

1379
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,480
#An entirely new world #?

1380
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,400
Made you watch.

ALADDIN
In a distant land, where the sun burned the desert in flames, there was an ancient secret.
It is a lamp long forgotten and buried deep under the sand.
It's small and simple.
It has no fanciful designs and contains no precious jewelry.
To all but the wisest among us, this would seem boring and worthless.
But this lamp is not what it seems.
Long ago, she held the greatest power in the entire land of Arabia.
It was magic that forever changed the course of a young man's life.
A young man who, like the lamp, was more than he seemed.
The story begins on a dark night, where a dark man waits with a dark goal. . . .
CHAPTER ONE
This man's name was Jafar and he was willing to wait.
His piercing eyes and pointed turban made him look like a cobra about to strike.
Perched on his shoulder, a parrot tilted its head impatiently.
Beneath him, his horse shifted and gave an agitated grunt.
The treasure was buried somewhere there.
Only one person would be able to find it: the one who possessed two halves of an ancient scarab.
Jafar had half, and soon he would have the other.
The treasure would then belong to him.
And with this, he would become the most powerful man in Agrabah.
In the silence, Jafar heard the clopping of hooves as a rider approached.
The man was a common thief named Gazeem, and he had agreed to
bring Jafar the other half of the scarab, in exchange for part of the treasure.
Jafar had promised. Jafar had lied.
“You’re late,” he said.
Gazeem dismounted and bowed his head.
Jafar was the royal vizier, the sultan's chief advisor. It was not wise to upset him.
“My apologies, oh patient one,” Gazeem said.
Jafar glared at him. “You have it then?” »
With a smile, the thief took half of the beetle out of his pocket.
Jafar grabbed him, but the thief held him back.
"And the treasure? You promised it to me."
To yell!
The parrot came down from Jafar's shoulder, grabbed the beetle, and dropped it into Jafar's bones.
hand.
“Trust me,” Jafar said. “You will get what’s coming to you.”
Quickly, he took out his half of the beetle.
He could feel his blood racing as he put the halves together.
They were shining. SO ...
BOOMOOOM!
A clap of thunder shook the desert.
The scarab burst from Jafar's hand as if it were alive.
He crossed the dunes in a burst of light.
Jafar spurred his horse.
“Quickly, follow the trail!” He shouted.
Gazeem mounted his own horse and ran after Jafar.
Shining like a comet, the beetle headed towards a small sandstone.
He circled around it, then stopped in the air.
Crack!
The beetle split in two again and burrowed into the rock, each half jamming into a small
hole.
Jafar stopped his horse and jumped.
The throbbing beetle stared at him like a huge pair of eyes.
An exhilarating thrill ran through him.
There was no going back now.
RRRRRRRMMMMMM!
The earth began to shake.
The strange eyes flashed wildly.
Gazeem cowered in fear.
Slowly the rock began to grow.
It expanded in all directions, changing shape.
The eyes remained, and now ears were formed, then a nose.
Finally, there was a mouth, huge and gaping.
A column of white light burst from within, nearly blinding Jafar.
The rock was now the face of a tiger, frozen in a furious, silent roar.
Jafar looked at him in awe.
His frightened parrot clung to his shoulder, digging in its claws.
“By Allah!” Gazeem whispered. “A tiger god!”
“Finally, lago!” Jafar said to his parrot. “After all my years of research, the Cave of Wonders!”
“Awk” Lago yelled. “Cave of Wonders!”
Jafar pulled Gazeem closer to him.
“Now remember,” he growled.
“Bring me the lamp.
The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!”
Gazeem swallowed hard.
He turned towards the tiger god's mouth and began to walk slowly.
“Awk! The lamp!” Lago repeated, loud enough for Gazeem to hear.
Then he leaned close to Jafar's ear and whispered, "Damn, where did you dig up that bozo?"
“Shh!” "" Jafar spat.
Lago didn't let anyone know that he could speak like a human – no one except his master, of course.
But right now, Jafar wasn't in the mood to listen.
He watched.
Watch and wait.
“Who disturbs my sleep!” » the tiger god growled, his voice echoing across the ground once again.
"Um... it's me, Gazeem, a humble thief."
His voice was a nervous cry and his knees were weak and trembling.
"Know this!" said the tiger god. “Only one person can enter here.
The one whose rags hide a pure heart – the Diamond in the Rough! »
Gazeem cast a doubtful look behind him.
"Keep on going!" » ordered Jafar.
Frightened, Qazeem turned towards the opening of the cave.
A staircase led down to... what? He couldn't say it. Carefully, he began to descend.
RRRRRAAAAUUUQQHHHHH!
The thunderous roar of the tiger god was unlike anything Jafar had ever heard.
Gazeem's cry could only be heard for a moment, then the tiger god's mouth closed abruptly,
silence the thief forever.
“Look for the diamond in the rough!” » ordered the tiger god.
Slowly, the rock collapsed into a mound of sand.
The beetle's halves flickered, then darkened.
Jafar watched silently as Lago dove into the mound and resurfaced, coughing up sand.
He picked up the halves of the beetle and returned to Jafar.
“I can’t believe this!” Lago said. “We’ll never get the chance to get our hands on that stupid lamp!”
"Patience, lago, patience. Gazeem obviously wasn't worthy of it."
“Now there’s a big surprise!” » Lago said, rolling his eyes. "So what are we going to do? We have a big
problem here—"
But Jafar simply reached out and closed Lago's beak. He needed calm.
“Only one can enter…” he said. “I have to find this one, this Diamond in the Rough.”
The diamond in the rough – Jafar understood what that meant.
An ordinary person, poor and dirty, who had brilliant qualities within him.
There was only one way to find this person, and Jafar knew exactly how to do it.
A devilish smile spread across his face.
He hadn't gotten the treasure tonight, but that didn't matter.
He was close – oh so close.
And before long, his wait would be over.
CHAPTER TWO
Stop, thief!”
The guard screamed at the top of his lungs as he chased a raggedly dressed boy through the crowd.
Agrabah market.
The boy zigzagged skillfully around the outdoor stalls: fruit sellers, clothing sellers, bakers, curios.
sellers.
In his right hand he held a loaf of bread.
Next to him ran a little monkey dressed in a vest and a hat.
I’ll get you, street rat!”, the guard shouted.
Street rat. If there was one name Aladdin hated, it was this one.
The Sultan's guards looked down on the poor people of Agrabah, people like him.
Of course, he sometimes stole food.
He had no choice: he had to eat.
But he wasn't a street rat.
“Come on, Abu!” Aladdin called his pet monkey.
He ran to a nearby house and jumped onto the low, flat roof.
Then he and Abu sprinted from roof to roof.
landing on a pair of clotheslines and eventually falling into a soft pile of clothes.
Instantly, he was grabbed by a pair of thick, hairy hands.
It was Rasoul, the head of the sultan's guard.
Rasoul was a man of few words, but if there was one thing he did well, it was catching young thieves.
"I got you !" Rasoul said as he picked up Aladdin.
Abu jumped on Rasoul's shoulder and pulled the guard's turban over his eyes.
Aladdin quickly freed himself and he and Abu fled.
They weaved through the market, passing a camel seller, a carpet seller, a jewelry cart.
Suddenly, Abou stopped.
The little monkey's eyes were fixed on the cart.
Abu had a great weakness: sparkling jewelry.
He crouched down next to the cart, reaching out to steal a pendant.
"Stop him!" » someone shouted.
Dozens of faces turned towards Abu.
Aladdin turned around. He grabbed Abu by the back of his neck.
To their right, the guards charged closer.
To their left, angry townspeople were closing in.
Aladdin and Abu ran straight ahead towards a staircase that led to a tall tower.
They ran up the stairs and through a window.
Aladdin grabbed a rug and using it as a parachute, he and Abu jumped from one window to another.
side of the building.
They jumped again, this time landing safely in a quiet little alley, obscured by the shadow of the Sultan's palace.
palace gates.
There, the sounds of the market were muffled.
Aladdin exhaled and sat down. He was starving.
“Alright, Abu, now we enjoy ourselves!” he said, breaking the loaf of bread in two.
But before he could eat, he saw in the shadows a fragile boy and girl.
They said nothing, but their wide, staring eyes spoke for them.
Aladdin could tell they hadn't eaten in days.
He looked at the bread. He had risked his life to get it – and his mouth was watering like crazy. But he
I couldn't let them go hungry.
With a sigh, he handed his half to the children.
“Come on, take it,” he said softly.
Abu frowned, but he also handed her his coin. The girl smiles.
She took Abu's bread and gently stroked his fur.
Abu liked it. People didn't usually treat him this kindly.
He raised his hat and walked away proudly – ​​and kicked Aladdin's legs straight.
But Aladdin didn't even notice it. His eyes were fixed on something straight ahead.
"Wow..." Aladdin muttered.
The market had gone silent.
In the middle was a man on horseback. He wore robes of the finest silk, studded with jewels.
As people cleared the way and bowed, the man raised his chin proudly in the air.
Aladdin walked out of the alley and towards the crowd. Everyone was whispering about rich people
man.
“It’s Prince Ahmed,” said a woman, “on his way to the palace.”
“Just another suitor for the princess,” an old man said, shaking his head.
“He’ll propose and she’ll kick him out, like everyone else.”
Aladdin looked at him in awe. If the princess could reject someone like that, she must be a pretty amazing girl!
Aladdin felt a pull on his leg. Abu pulled him towards the crowd. Aladdin could see a group of poor people
children gathering too close to Prince Ahmed's horse.
Suddenly the horse jumped, frightening the children, and the prince shouted: “Get out of my way, you dirty thing
kids !"
Angered, Aladdin pushed through the crowd and strutted up to Prince Ahmed.
“If I were as rich as you,” he shouted, “I could afford some manners!”
“Get out of my way, you flea-bitten street rat!” Prince Ahmed kicked his horse and brushed against Aladdin,
throwing him into the mud.
Burning with anger, Aladdin jumped up and began to run after the prince's horse.
"I'm worthless! I'm not a street rat!" He shouted.
He ran to the palace gates. With a loud noise,
they slammed him in the face. “And I don’t have fleas!” he shouted to the closed doors.
Prince Ahmed never even looked back. Aladdin bowed his head sadly and slumped back to town. As
A freezing darkness settled over Agrabah that night, Aladdin and Abu climbed onto the roof of an old ruined building.
building. There were only a few mats and a few worn pillows, but for Aladdin and Abu it was
House. Abu curled up on a pillow and closed his eyes. With a smile, Aladdin covered him with a soft rug.
“One day, Abu, things will be different,” he said. "We will be dressed in robes instead of rags. And
we will be inside a palace, looking out, instead of looking out."
In the distance, the Sultan's palace stood majestically.
“That would be life, wouldn’t it, Abu?” Being rich, living in a palace and never having any problems at all. »
With a sigh, Aladdin fell asleep.
CHAPTER THREE
“Meeeooow!”
The cry came from the palace menagerie. This echoed in the throne room, where the sultan covered
his ears.
Beat! The door slammed against the wall of the throne room and stomped
an angry Prince Ahmed.
“I have never been so insulted!” he shouted.
“Good luck marrying her!”
“But... but...” stammered the sultan.
The prince walked right next to him and exited through the other door, revealing a large hole in the bottom of his pants.
"Jasmine!" » bellowed the sultan.
He was a turbulent, happy and kind old man, loved by his subjects. Only one person could have it
upset – his daughter.
Princess Jasmine. He loved her very much, but she was so... stubborn. All he wanted her to marry was
prince. Every princess has done it.
But Jasmine? No, no one was good enough for her! He entered the palace menagerie. The sound of
water was everywhere, flowing in marble streams, gushing into pools from hand-carved fountains.
It was the most beautiful place in all of Agrabah.
But the Sultan no longer noticed any of this. "Jasmine!" he called back.
“Rrrrrrr…” came a soft groan.
There was a flash of orange and black. The Sultan came face to face with a tiger, his teeth
hanging from the missing piece of Prince Ahmed's pants.
"It's fucked. Rajah!" said the sultan, grabbing the torn fabric.
Rajah slipped to the bottom of the garden, where the sultan's daughter was sitting on the edge of a fountain.
“Oh, Father, Rajah was just playing,” she said, gently stroking the tiger. "You were just playing with it
You're overdressed and self-absorbed, Prince Ahmed, aren't you? » she said to Rajah.
Jasmine was beyond beautiful. Princes from miles around risked their lives crossing the desert to see
her. Each swore to conquer the world for their love.
But as for Jasmine, well, she was tired of idiot princes and boastful nobles. If only one of
they would show a little
intelligence...a little kindness, honesty and a sense of humor wouldn't hurt either.
The Sultan shook his head. "Dearest, you need to stop rejecting all suitors. The law says you have to be
married to a prince before your next birthday. You only have three days left. »
“The law is false!” Jasmine replied.
"Father, I hate being forced to marry. If I marry, I want it to be out of love."
“It’s not just the law,” the sultan said softly. He hesitated for a minute before continuing. "I'm not going to
be here forever, and I just want to make sure you're taken care of.
"But I've never done anything on my own! I've never had a real
friends, except you. Rajah,” said Jasmine, stroking her tiger.
the head. “I’ve never even left the palace walls!”
“But Jasmine, you’re a princess!” cried the sultan.
“So maybe I don’t want to be a princess anymore!”
“Ooooooo!” The Sultan raised his hands and stomped back into the
Throne Room.
A shadow appeared behind him. It was the tall, thin shadow of a man
in a pointed turban, with a parrot on his shoulder. In his right hand
It was a long stick with a snake's head carved on the top.
The sultan turned around.
“Ah Jafar, my most trusted advisor!” he said. “I desperately need your wisdom.”
“My life is only to serve you,” Jafar said with a tight, thin-lipped smile.
“Jasmine refuses to choose a husband,” the Sultan said. “I’m at the end of my tether!”
"Awk! It's over!" Lago shouted.
The Sultan reached into a porcelain bowl and pulled out a cracker. "Have a cracker. Pretty Polly?" he said.
If there was one thing Lago hated, it was eating crackers. Especially the dry and stale ones that the Sultan owned. He
practically gagged as the sultan shoved the crackers into his beak.
“Your Majesty certainly has trouble with stupid animals,” Jafar remarked. "Now maybe I can find
a solution to your problem, but it would require the use of Blue Diamond.
The sultan backed away. He clutched the ring on his finger. "My ring has been in the family since
years…” he protested.
Jafar held his staff before the sultan's eyes. The snake head's eyes began to glow. "It is necessary
find a suitor for the princess, right? » Jafar said as he moved closer, "Don't worry... everything will be fine." »
The Sultan couldn't help but look at the snake's head. His will was running out.
“Everything will be fine,” he hummed, taking the ring off his finger and giving it to Jafar.
Jafar smiled. “You are very kind, father,” said Jafar. "Now run and play with your toys,
hmmm"
“Yes…” the sultan said dreamily, waddling.
Jafar turned and left the throne room. As he rushed down a marble corridor, Lago began to spit
crackers.
"I can't take it anymore! If I have to eat one more of those disgusting moldy crackers, I'll get
him by the neck and…”
“Calm down, lago,” Jafar said. "This Blue Diamond will reveal to us the Rough Diamond - the
the one who can enter the cave and
bring us the lamp.
At the end of the corridor, Jafar entered his private quarters. "Soon he will be a sultan, not this giant
a bit of stupidity!”
“And then,” Lago sang, “I shove crackers down his throat!”
At the other end of the dark room, Jafar pushed open a secret door, revealing a spiral staircase. He
began to climb the stairs that led to his private laboratory. In every corner
From the room, potions were bubbling in glass beakers. There was a huge cauldron in the back and a huge
hourglass on an old table.
Jafar walked towards the hourglass, holding the Blue Diamond. “Now, Lago, let’s go to work.”
Early the next morning. Jasmine crept up to the palace wall. Rajah followed closely behind him, his shoulders slumped
in sadness.
"I'm sorry. Rajah," Jasmine said, "but I can't stay here and live my life for me."
Tears welled up inside her. It was hard enough running away from his father. But we must examine
Rajah's eyes made it even more painful
than she could have imagined. She had to move it now, otherwise she might change it
spirit. Walk on Rajah's back. Jasmine quickly climbs the
garden wall. Stopping at the top, she said: "I'm going to miss you. Rajah. Qoodbye."
Then she disappeared overboard, into the land of her subjects – a
a land she had never visited before.
CHAPTER FOUR
Breakfast is served, Abu!" said Aladdin, opening a
ripe and juicy melon. Perched on an awning, the two friends had a
perfect view of the bustling market below. All around them,
merchants advertised their wares. “Buy a pot – brass and silver!” » called one.
“Sweet dates and figs!” shouted another as he walked through a crowd of people watching a fire-eater.
"Pistachios! Leave the fire
roast them for you!”
"Fresh fish!" cried a third salesman. Aladdin watched as the man waved a large fish high in the air, almost
punch him in the face of a young person
girl who was covered in a thin coat. She staggered back and collided with the fire-eater. He
belched a long plume of fire.
"Oh!" cried the young girl in surprise. “Excuse me, I’m sorry!”
Aladdin stopped eating. He couldn't help but stare.
Maybe it was his eyes, so deep and kind. Or her hair, like a waterfall made of the blackest silk. Or her
perfect skin, or she...
Aladdin blushed. He never thought of girls that way. But this one… well, this one was different. Special
either way. Aladdin looked at her
as she made her way through the market. Jasmine spotted a little boy in ragged clothes standing in a daze outside
of a
pile of ripe fruit. “You must be hungry,” she said, grabbing an apple from the cart. "Here is."
The child beamed. Grabbing the apple, he runs away.
“You better pay for that!” said the seller.
"Pay?" Jasmine looked perplexed. She had never paid anything in
his life. "I'm sorry, sir, I don't have any money, but I'm sure I can get some
some from the sultan…”
"Thief!" The salesman grabbed his arm. With his other hand he pulled
took out a shiny knife. “Do you know what the penalty is for theft?
Suddenly, Aladdin rushed between them and grabbed the seller.
arm. “Thank you, kind sir, I’m so happy you found my sister!” he said.
Turning to Jasmine, he growled, "I've been looking everywhere for you!"
Jasmine
was about to protest when Aladdin whispered: "Play the game..."
The seller took Aladdin aside and said to him: “Do you know this girl?
said she knew the sultan! »
“She is my sister,” Aladdin replied. Then, lowering his voice, he said:
"Unfortunately, she's a little crazy. She thinks the monkey is the sultan."
Quickly, Jasmine began to bow to Abu. “O Wise Sultan,” she said.
“How may I serve you?”
People in the crowd started laughing. Aladdin helped Jasmine up and
He said, "Now come on. Sister. It's time to see the doctor."
As the seller looked at Aladdin and Jasmine, Abu snatched some apples.
the cart and stuffed them into his jacket.
Jasmine stopped in front of a camel and said: "Hello, doctor, how
are you?"
“No, no, not that one,” said Aladdin. "Come on. Sister." He called
his shoulder, "Come on. Sultan!"
Abu followed them. He puffed out his chest, imitating the
sultan – and three apples fell from his jacket.
The salesman turned red with fury. “Come back here, you little thieves!”
He cried.
But it was too late. All three started running and
disappeared into the crowd.
At the palace, Jafar laughed with evil glee, Lago was frantically
spin a wheel attached to a generator. Electricity flashed
from the generator into a bubbling cauldron. Slowly a shimmer
a blue cloud formed in the air.
The Blue Diamond was enclosed in a frame above a huge
Hourglass. Jafar thrust his arm in front of him, chanting, “Go, sands of time! Reveal to me the one who can
enter the cave!”
He turned the hourglass over. Then, with a big cmack! a bolt of
lightning flashes from the cloud. He hit the diamond, which exploded
in pulsed blue light.
The sand in the hourglass began to glow and swirl. Slowly a picture
began to form – an image of Aladdin running through the
walk.
“Is this the clown we were waiting for?”, blurted Lago.
"Yes, a little kid in rags. How perfect, we'll never miss him!"
Jafar looked at Lago with a twisted smile. "Let the guards prolong
an invitation to the palace, okay?
Aladdin, Abu and Jasmine jumped from roof to roof in the
walk. Aladdin could tell Jasmine had never been to this part
from Agrabah before. But he had to admit one thing: when it came to
hopping on the roofs, she learned quickly.
When Aladdin and Abu finally arrived home. Jasmine looked
and I said, “Is this where you live?”
“Yes, just me and Abu,” Aladdin replied. "It's not much, but it has a
great view. » He pointed to the palace. “Amazing, huh? I wonder
what would it be like to live there and have servants and valets..."
Jasmine sighed. "And the people who tell you where to go and how
dress."
“It’s better than here,” Aladdin replied. "Always looking for food
and dodge the guards—"
“Never be free to make your own choices,” Jasmine said. "Always
feeling-"
“Trapped,” they said at the same time. Their eyes met and they
smiles. Aladdin blushed, then quickly took an apple from Abu and
I threw it to Jasmine. “So where are you from?” he asked, changing
the object.
“What does it matter?” Jasmine replied. "Iran
far away, and I won't come back. My father forces me to take
married".
“It’s horrible!” said Aladdin.
Jasmine's eyes met his again. Suddenly Aladdin could no longer speak,
I couldn't even move. Strange feelings ran through him,
feelings so strong that they made him dizzy.
Who was this mysterious girl?
Aladdin could hear Abu chattering wildly, but he wasn't listening. All that he
He could see, all he could hear was Jasmine.
"There you are!" » roared a voice.
Aladdin came out of his trance. Below them stood a group of
the sultan's guards, swords drawn.
“They’re after me!” Aladdin and Jasmine said together. They
stopped, looking at each other in confusion, then spoke again to the
at the same time: “Are they after you?”
But we didn't have time to figure things out. Aladdin looked over
opposite side of the roof. There was a pile of hay underneath. "Trust yourself
me?" he asked Jasmine, pulling her closer. Their eyes met again.
“Well... yes,” she replied.
“Then jump!”
Aladdin, Jasmine and Abu jumped from the roof. They
landed safely in the hay and quickly got back up. Aladdin turned
around, ready to sprint for his life.
But it was too late. Rasoul towered over him with a smirk. "We just keep
cross paths, eh, street rat? This is the dungeon for you,
boy!"
Jasmine stood in Rasoul's path. "Let him go!"
“Look, a street mouse!” Rasoul growled. Laughing, he pushed
Jasmine on the ground.
Jasmine jumped up. Anger shone in his eyes. Royally
removing her hood, she said in a firm and authoritative voice:
“Let him go, by order of the princess!”
"Princess?" repeated Aladdin.
The guards froze in shock. “Princess Jasmine?” said Rasoul. "What-
what are you doing outside the palace?
“Just do as I command,” Jasmine said. “Release him.”
"I would, Princess," replied Rasoul, "except that my orders come from
Jafar. You will need to discuss this with him. »
And with a sheepish shrug, he dragged Aladdin away.
“Believe me, I will!” Jasmine exclaimed.
Return to the palace. Jasmine burst into Jafar's room. There he
was, as devious and sinister as always.
“Princess,” he said, “how can I be of service to you?”
Princess Jasmine stared into his eyes. “Jafar, the guards
I just picked up a boy from the market – on your orders! »
“Your father charged me with keeping the peace in Agrabah,” Jafar said. "The boy was a criminal. He
I tried to kidnap you.”
“He didn’t kidnap me!” Jasmine replied. "I ran away!"
Jafar's brow furrowed in worry. "Oh my God, how terribly upsetting. If I had known..." His voice
dragged out.
"What do you mean?" » asked Jasmine.
“Unfortunately, the boy’s sentence has already been carried out.”
Jasmine shivered. " Which sentence ?
Jafar sighed. He placed a hand on Jasmine's shoulder. "Dead", Jafar
said softly. “By decapitating.”
A gasp stuck in Jasmine's throat. “How...how could you?”
She turned and ran out the door, stopping only when she reached the
menagerie.
Rajah happily jumped towards her, but Jasmine ran
right next to him. She collapsed by a fountain, tears streaming down her
plays.
“Do you trust me!” the boy asked him. Yes, she had. This boy was
so different from others – funny, kind, friendly….
And now he was dead. Because of a stupid mistake.
“Oh, Rajah,” she said. “This is all my fault. I didn't even know his
name."
Jasmine buried her head in Rajah's fur and cried.
CHAPTER FIVE
The palace dungeon was cold, dark and dirty. Not even the
the sultan had already entered there. All the prisoners were brought there by
Jafar – and not one had escaped.
Aladdin was determined to be first. He growled loudly, struggling
to his chains, but they clung to the stone wall.
Jafar had lied to Jasmine. Aladdin was alive, but not for long, though
everything went according to Jafar's plan.
Aladdin collapsed to the ground with a sigh. “She was the princess,” he said
said to himself. "I can not believe it !"
At that moment, a shadow appeared on the wall: the shadow of a small
monkey placed between the bars of the prison window. “Abou!”
Aladdin shouted, turning around. "Here!"
Abu came down. He frowned at Aladdin and chattered angrily as
he imitated a pretty girl walking.
Aladdin knew he was also reprimanded for paying
lots of attention to Jasmine. "Hey, she was in trouble," he said, "I'm going
I'll never see her again anyway. I'm a street rat, remember! In addition,
there is a law that says she must marry a prince. » He exhaled
with frustration. “She deserves a prince.”
Abu took a small pickaxe from his jacket pocket and unlocked Aladdin's.
handcuffs. Smiling in triumph, he pulled Aladdin towards the window.
But Aladdin collapsed to the ground. He was still thinking about
Jasmine. “I’m a fool,” he said.
“You’re just a fool if you give up,” said a cracking voice.
Aladdin turned to see an old man with crooked teeth limping out of the room.
shadows. His white beard hung to the ground and he had a bump.
his back. He looked like he had been in the dungeon for years.
"Who are you!" » asked Aladdin.
"I am a humble prisoner like you, but together, perhaps we can be
more. I know a cave filled with treasures beyond your wildest
dreams." The man came closer, smiling. "There are enough treasures
to impress your princess, I would bet.
Abu's eyes lit up at the mention of the treasure. He shot Aladdin
vest.
None of them saw Lago come out of the old man's hump and
whispers: “Jafar, can you hurry up! I'm dying here!
Aladdin gave the prisoner a desperate look. "But the law says she must
marry-"
Jafar cut Aladdin off. He raised a bony finger and spoke again
with an old man's voice. "You have heard of the Golden Rule! He who
Gold makes the rules!”
“Why would you share this treasure with me?” » asked Aladdin.
“I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go.” Jafar
walked to the dungeon wall and pushed one of the stones. Slowly one
an entire section of the wall opened, revealing a hidden staircase. "U.S. too
Do you have a deal?”
Aladdin hesitated, but he shook the old man's hand.
Jafar chuckled in excitement. “Were out!”
It was dark when they reached the Cave of Wonders. Jafar took
Remove the beetle pieces and assemble them again.
Aladdin watched in awe as the pieces flew into the sandstone and
a huge tiger god emerges.
“Who is disturbing my sleep?” the intimidating voice rang out. Jafar
beckoned Aladdin to come closer.
Abu jumped into Aladdin's vest. Aladdin tried to keep himself from
trembling. "Um, it's me... Aladdin."
A tunnel of harsh light burst from the tiger god's mouth. Aladdin had
turn away. “Go on,” the voice continued. "Don't touch anything except the
lamp."
“Quickly, my boy,” Jafar urged in his old man’s voice, “go get the
lamp, and then you will have your reward!”
Cautiously, Aladdin entered the tiger god's mouth. Through
In the blinding light, he saw a long staircase leading down. At
below there were mountains of gold. Golden waterfalls. Coins,
jewelry, plates, bowls, goblets, chests, all piled up as far as the eye can see.
could see.
Abu was practically hypnotized by the sight of all this gold and left
straight ahead for a huge treasure chest.
“Abou!” Aladdin warned. “Don’t touch anything! We have to find this
lamp."
Abu grumbled, but turned away from the chest and followed his master through the cave, until he heard a noise.
odd
movement behind him. He turned to look.
Nothing, just a purple rug with gold pompoms on the floor.
Abu turned and ran towards Aladdin.
This time something hit Abu on the shoulder, then ripped his
hat. Abu turned around again.
It was the carpet that walked behind him.
“Eeeeeeeee!” » Abu shouted, jumping on Aladdin for protection.
Frightened, the carpet quickly ran behind a large pile of coins.
“Stop it, Abu!” » said Aladdin.
» Abu chattered, pointing to the large mound. Aladdin turned and
I saw a pompom stick out, then quickly tuck in.
Aladdin moved closer to get a better look. He could see the carpet
s'éloi from him. "A flying carpet !" he said. Then he called,
“Come out, we won’t hurt you.”
Using its two lower pom-poms as legs and its upper pom-poms as hands, the
The rug slowly emerged and held out Aladdin Abu's hat. that of Aladdin
mouth wide open in disbelief.
Abu grabbed the hat and started scolding the carpet.
The carpet slowly moved away, sagging in shame. “Hey, wait a minute
minute, don't go!" said Aladdin. "Maybe you can help us find this
lamp...."
The rug turned around and started pointing excitedly. Aladdin
smiles. “I think he knows where it is!”
Rising from the ground, the carpet began to fly. Aladdin and Abu
I followed him into another cave.
Aladdin stopped abruptly. This cave made the other look
like a waiting room. It stretched so high that Aladdin couldn't see
the ceiling. The walls were a cold blue, unlike any color he had ever known.
seen in the desert. An aqua blue lagoon of water stretching from the wall to
wall.
In the center of the lake stood a tower of solid rock with only a series
stepping stones that lead to it. At the top, lit by a beam of magical light,
was a small object.
It was too far to see, but Aladdin knew it must be the lamp.
His heart began to race. It wouldn't be easy to reach the top. First he
he would have to hopscotch on the rocks, then he would have to
climb the steep and jagged rock tower.
“Wait here,” he said to Abu and the mat. "And remember, don't
touch anything. »
Jumping from stone to stone, Aladdin arrived at the base of the
tower. With a sudden groan, the sloping rock transformed into a
stairs.
Aladdin smiled. Someone – something – was by his side. He ran
upwards, two steps at a time.
At the top, the lamp was clearly visible.
It was dusty and dented and looked cheaper than worst used
lamp he had ever seen on the market.
Aladdin got it back. "That's it?" he said to himself. "That's what we
did you come all the way here to?”
Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted Abu and the rug. They
were in front of a large golden statue that looked like a giant monkey
idol. His arms were outstretched, and in his cupped palms he held a
huge red jewel.
And Abu was reaching out to make it happen.
“Abou!” Aladdin shouted. "No!"
But it was too late. Abu had the jewel in his hands.
The ground instantly began to rumble. Stones and dust fell
above. The tiger god's voice rang out like a cannon: “Infidels! YOU
have touched the forbidden treasures! Now you'll never see again
daylight!"
The jewel began to melt in Abu's hand. Panicked, he put it back in
the palms of the statue.
But the damage was already done. The staircase under Aladdin
transformed into a long chute, and his feet gave way.
With a last-minute leap, Aladdin grabbed the lamp. Collapse
From the slide, he saw the lagoon transform into a pool of boiling lava. He has closed
his eyes, preparing for the end.
Wow! He stopped in mid-flight. Something was pushing him upwards.
His eyes opened suddenly.
The carpet had caught up with him, and he won!
The cavern shook violently. Aladdin clung tightly to the carpet. He
dodged left and right as large rocks fell from the ceiling. Aladdin
looked down, searching for Abu.
“Eeeeeee!” came a cry from below. There he was, hopping across the
springboards and screams. Over his head a rock rushed
towards him.
With acceleration, the carpet collapsed. Plucked Aladdin
Abu moved away from the danger, then flew towards the entrance of the cave. THE
the ground below erupted when the
piles of dazzling treasures caught fire. Aladdin and Abu looked
down in horror. Coins and jewelry were melting!
The carpet ran up the stairs, charred by a wave of lava. They
I could see the starry sky through the entrance above. Just a little bit
no more feet....
THANKS! A jagged piece of stone fell onto the carpet, pinning it to the floor.
ground.
Aladdin and Abu fell down the stairs.
Aladdin looked at the carpet in dismay. There was no way he
could save him. It would be hard enough to save yourself.
He looked up. He could see the opening at the top: freedom. Abu
I climbed the steps and jumped out.
Aladdin followed as quickly as he could, but the stairs began to shake.
He lost his footing.
Jumping up, he rushed to the top step. His fingers gripped
on it – just as the entire staircase buckled beneath him.
Aladdin was swinging above the collapsing cave. "Help me!" he is crying. "I
I can’t hold on!”
Still dressed as a beggar, Jafar peered over the edge. "Give me first
the lamp!"
There was no time to argue. Aladdin held it out.
Jafar's eyes glowed as he grabbed the lamp and shoved it into his
bathrobe. "Finally!" » he shouted in triumph. Eyeing Aladdin, he pulled
pulled out a dagger.
"What are you doing?" Aladdin cried.
"I'll give you your reward!" Jafar replied. “Your eternal reward.”
Abu jumped on Jafar, biting him hard on the arm.
“Yeahgggggh!” Jafar shouted. He fought hard, but Abu held on.
Finally, Jafar dropped the dagger. With a furious gesture, he threw
Abu in the cave.
Aladdin's fingers couldn't hold on any longer. He let go.
The walls of the cave raced past him as he and Abu fell headlong.
heels.
CHAPTER Six
Aladdin woke up on the floor of the cave. The fire was out, the lava had disappeared, only the constant drip of water echoed.
throughout the cave.
Above him were the carpet and Abu.
Aladdin groaned and sat up. The carpet fell and Abu began to
stir. Above him, Aladdin could see no openings, only the solid ceiling.
of the cave.
“We are trapped,” he said. "That two-faced son of a jackal! He's long
left with this lamp.
Abou jumped up. Something bulging in his jacket: a jewel, Aladdin
figuratively. Like a magician, Abu waved his arms, reached into his jacket,
and took out the hidden object.
Aladdin blinked and shook his head. It was the lamp!
"Well, little thief," Aladdin said with a smile. He took the battered lamp and examined it carefully.
"There is something written on it,
but it's difficult to understand.
Aladdin rubbed the faded words with his sleeve. He
was almost impossible to remove the grime. He rubbed harder and
louder, then stopped abruptly.
The lamp was shining!
Aladdin gasped. Abu and the carpet moved back.
So... Poooof! Colorful smoke bursts from the lamp's nozzle. He
whirled wildly, becoming a blue cloud, slowly transforming into a
form - a huge flowing shape with arms, a chest, a head and a
crazy-eyed face with a long, black, curly beard.
“Ten thousand years will give you such a sore neck!” blue
said the creature.
Aladdin and Abu watched as he grabbed his head and
I twisted it all around. “Wow, does that feel good!” he said.
"Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hello! What's your name?"
"Um... Aladdin."
"Hello, Aladdin! Can I call you Al? Or maybe just Din. Or how about
Kid? “Here, my boy!” Come on. Kid!' "He whistled and pretended
call a dog. Then, in another puff of blue smoke, he became a giant
dog.
Eyes wide, Aladdin turned towards the carpet. "I had to hit my
The head is harder than I thought.”
The creature has returned to its original form. "Say, you are a lot
smaller than my last master!”, he said.
“Wait a minute,” Aladdin said. "I am your master ?"
'That's right! And I am your genie, straight from the lamp! Here
for the fulfillment of your wishes! Three wishes, to be exact – and ixnay on the
I wish for even more wishes! Three, that's all! No substitutions,
exchanges, or refunds!”
“Three wishes?” Aladdin said. “I want three?”
“Uh, almost,” the genie replied. "There are some limits. Rule
number one: I can't kill anyone, so don't ask. Rule number two: I
I can't make someone fall in love with someone else. Rule number three
—I can't bring people back to life. Apart from that, you have
he!"
Aladdin loved this genie. He decided to tease him a little.
"Boundaries?" He sighed. "An all-powerful genius. I don't know,
Abu, he probably won't even be able to get us out of this cave. »
The genie placed his hands on his hips. "Excuse me? You don't believe
me?" Jumping onto the carpet, he picked up Aladdin and Abu in his
mammoth hands. "You get your wishes, so sit down, and we
get out of here !"
He put them down, then raised his arm above his head. A thunderous
a boom sounded above them, and a crack
open in the ceiling of the cavern. The rocks and sand crumbled, and early
the morning light flooded in.
The carpet began to lift. He spiraled upward, gaining speed.
Aladdin stood firm as the genie stepped back and let out a laugh that
makes the walls shake.
Aladdin couldn't help but laugh himself. The desert air never
it smelled so good.
He was free.
And he still had his three wishes left.
CHAPTER SEVEN
Jafar, this is a scandal!”, the sultan shouted, pacing back and forth on the throne.
room, "From now on, you will discuss the sentencing of prisoners
with me... before they are beheaded!”
Princess Jasmine scowled at Jafar as he lowered his head. On his
shoulder, even Lago looked sorry. “My most humble apologies to both
you,” Jafar said.
“At least there will be some good if I am forced to marry,” Jasmine
said. "When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of
you, Jafar!” With that, she headed towards the menagerie.
"Jasmine!" » shouted the sultan, running after her.
Jafar watched them leave. His sad and painful look began to
disappear. All his rage and frustration boiled over. "If only I had
I got this lamp,” he muttered through gritted teeth.
"Saying we have to keep kissing until this idiot and his idiot
my daughter for the rest of our lives,” Lago said.
“Until she found a stupid husband,” Jafar remarked. "So she goes
have us banished or beheaded! »
“Wait a minute, Jafar!” Lago said. “What if you married the princess?”
So you become the sultan, right? »
Jafar slowly walked over to the throne and sat down. It was wonderful !
“Hmmmm,” he said. “The idea has merit”
"Yeah!" Lago shouted. "And then we leave the step-dad and the little one
woman from the top of a cliff - ker-splat! »
Jafar burst out laughing. “I love the way your dirty little mind works!”
In a desert oasis just outside Agrabah, the carpet fell on
sand. The genie turned to Aladdin with a proud smile. "Well how
about that, huh? Do you doubt me now? »
“No,” said Aladdin. "Now, about my three wishes..."
" Three ? » said the genie. “You lost one, boy!” »
Aladdin smiled mischievously. "I never really wanted to get out of
The cave. You did it alone!”
The genie thought for a moment. “Very good,” he said, laughing.
'You win. But no more presents!”
Aladdin jumped off the mat and started pacing. "Hmm ...
three wishes... What would you wish for?
"Me? No one's ever asked me that before." The genius thinks about it
for a moment. “Well, in my case… freedom.”
“You mean, you’re a prisoner?” » asked Aladdin.
“That’s what being a genius is all about.” The genie shrugged his shoulders.
“Phenomenal cosmic powers, a tiny living space.”
The carpet, Abu and Aladdin looked inside the small lamp. "Genius,
It’s terrible,” Aladdin said.
“To be free, to be my own master, that would be greater than anything
magic and all the treasures of the world. » The genie sighed. " But the
The only way I can get out is if my master wants me out, so you can
guess how many times this happened.
Aladdin thought for a moment. “I’ll do it,” he said finally.
“I will free you.”
“Yeah, right,” the genie said, rolling his eyes.
“No, I’m not lying,” said Aladdin. "I promise you, after
my first two wishes, I will use my third wish to free you.
“Okay, I hope so!” said the genie. “Now what do you want?”
“Well,” said Aladdin, “there’s this girl—”
"Wrong! I can't make anyone fall in love, remember?"
“But Genie, she’s smart and funny and beautiful.”
Aladdin shrugged and looked at the ground. “But she’s the princess.
To even have a chance, I would have to be—"
That was it! The answer was right in front of him! "Hey!" Aladdin
said. “Can you make me...a prince?”
The genie raised an eyebrow. "Is this an official wish? Say magic
words "
“Genius, I wish you would make me a prince!” Aladdin blurted.
"All right!" The genie began to circle around Aladdin. "Now first we
we need to get rid of the fez and vest combo. » With a broad gesture,
he conjured up a fine silk robe and a turban with a dazzling jewel
and shiny gold trim. “Ooh, I like it!”
"Wow!" Aladdin couldn't believe how... princely he looked. No
we would now dare to call him “street rat”. He picked up the lamp and
he hid it under his turban. No honest prince would dare to be seen with
such junk.
"Hmmm, you'll need transportation...." The genie looked
Abu. "Uh, excuse me! Monkey boy!"
Abu runs away, trying to hide. But it was useless. With a clap of his hand
fingers, the genie transformed him into a camel. “Hmmm...not good
That's enough," said the genie, snapping his fingers again. This time, Abu
appeared as
a magnificent stallion. “Still not enough” With a
decisive, Abu transformed again, this time into a
elephant. "What better way to make your entrance into the streets
of Agrabah than riding your own elephant! Let's talk about the trunk
space!"
Aladdin could do nothing but stare, stunned. The genie was on
a roll. He gestured wildly, laughing out loud. “Hang on
to your turban, kid!” he shouted. “We’re going to make you a star!”
CHAPTER EIGHT
Jafar rushed into the throne room, holding a large scroll. "Sire,"
he called the sultan: "I have found a solution to the problem
with your daughter!”
“Awk! » » shouted Lago. “Trouble with your daughter!”
"It's here." Jafar unfolded the parchment and began to read: "If one
the princess didn't choose a husband until her sixteenth birthday, so
the sultan will choose for her! »
The Sultan nodded. "But Jasmine hated all these suitors. How can I
choose someone she might hate?
“Don’t worry, there’s more,” Jafar said as he unrolled the parchment further.
"In case a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess can be
we got married at...' Hmmm, interesting..."
"What?" » asked the sultan. “WHO?”
“The royal vizier. Jafar looked up. “Well, it’s me!”
“But I thought the law said only a prince could marry a princess,”
said the sultan, grabbing the parchment
Jafar quickly placed it on a table and picked up his staff. "Desperate
The times call for desperate measures, my lord.
The snake's head began to glow with a hypnotic light. “Yes”, the sultan
he said, his eyes wide. “Desperate times…”
“You will order the princess to marry me,” Jafar said confidently.
"I will order the princess to—"
Ra-ta'ta'taaaaaah! The sound of trumpets echoed through the
window. The Sultan blinked and turned towards the noise. "What-
What! I heard something!”
Instantly, the spell was broken. The Sultan rushed to the window and
Looked outside. Muttering, Jafar followed.
A huge group was marching down the main street. A giant peacock
the float moved slowly behind; lions and bears in colorfully painted cages
rolled by. People filled the streets to see the great procession
approaching.
“Make way for Prince Ali Ababwa!” sang the conductor. Behind him
strode a majestic elephant, its trunk proudly raised in the air. On his
back, a glass roof bounced up and down.
From the canopy, Aladdin smiled and waved. The crowd roared
with admiration. The dancers twirled around him, the swordsmen walked
in perfect harmony, and dozens of servants walked alongside them. Abu
proudly, and the rug made a perfect cushion for
Aladdin on Abu's lumpy back.
The genie floated among the crowd, changing at regular intervals.
a few minutes later a drum major, a girl from the harem, an old man, a child. In each
disguise, he told everyone what a splendid prince was approaching.
By the time Aladdin arrived at the palace gates, he was already the talk of the town.
Agrabah. Everyone around him: Abu, the swordsmen, the fanfare,
the dancers and everyone else walked straight into the throne room.
As the Sultan and Jafar stared, Aladdin slipped off Abu's back and onto
the carpet. "Your Majesty," said Aladdin, bowing to the
sultan, "I have come from afar to seek your daughter's hand."
“Prince Ali Ababwa!” said the sultan with a bright smile. "I am
nice to meet you. This is my royal vizier, Jafar. »
Jafar didn't look happy at all. "I'm scared. Prince Abooboo—"
“Ababwa” Aladdin corrected him.
“Whatever,” Jafar said. "You can't just parade around here without being invited
And-"
“What a remarkable device!” exclaimed the sultan, looking at the
carpet. "Can I try?"
"Well, certainly. Your Majesty!" Aladdin said. He helped the sultan
on the carpet. He took off, sending the Sultan flying around the room.
As the old man hooted with joy, Jafar looked at Aladdin warily.
“Just where did you say you were from?”
Before Aladdin could respond, the carpet fell and left him
the sultan leaves. "Well, he's a very impressive youngster, and a prince,
Besides!" Lowering his voice, the Sultan said to Jafar: "If we are lucky,
you won't have to marry Jasmine after all! »
"I don't trust him..." Jafar said.
The sultan ignored him. "That's absurd, Jafar. Jasmine is going to like this one."
“And I’m sure I’ll love Princess Jasmine,” said Aladdin.
"Your Highness!" Jafar blurted. “On behalf of Jasmine, I must say—”
“Let her meet me,” Aladdin interrupted. "I will win your
girl."
None of them had seen Jasmine come in from the menagerie, with
Rajah behind her. "How dare you!" she says. "Standing,
decide my future. I am not a prize to be won! » With that, she
turned around and stormed out.
Aladdin's heart sank. He was sure she would love him as a prince. He
I never thought this would happen.
"Don't worry. Prince Ali," said the Sultan. "Just give him time to calm down
down. It will warm you up.”
Aladdin and the Sultan entered the menagerie. Jafar looked
silently, then turned to Lago. "I think it's time to say goodbye to
Prince Aboubou...."
CHAPTER NINE
The rest of the day Aladdin waited in the
menagerie. Jasmine's room was above our heads, but she refused to do that.
come to his balcony.
As night fell, Aladdin began to lose hope. "What am I going to do
do?" he groaned. "I should have known I couldn't pull off this stupid
princely act."
Abu looked at his master and waved his trunk in sympathy.
“Very good,” said the genie, looking up from a game of chess with the
carpet. "Here's the deal. If you want to court him, you have to tell him
the truth. Be yourself!"
"Certainly not!" Aladdin said. "If Jasmine found out I was really someone
dirty street rat, she would make fun of me. » He looked up at Jasmine's eyes.
balcony and stood up. “I’m going to go see her,” he said.
said. "I have to be smooth. Cool. Confident."
The genie sighed. He knew Aladdin was going to be in trouble.
The carpet slid beneath Aladdin, lifting him up to Jasmine's balcony.
Through his window, Aladdin could see her playing with Rajah.
“Princess Jasmine?” he called.
Jasmine turned and walked towards the window. "Who is here?"
“It’s me,” said Aladdin. Then, remembering his voice as Prince Ali, he
added: “Prince Ali Ababwa”.
"I do not want to see you!" » Jasmine spat.
As she returned to the room, Aladdin got off the carpet and
on the balcony. “Please, Princess, give me a chance!”
Rajah threw himself in his way. Aladdin jerked away, almost losing his
turban.
Jasmine narrowed her eyes. "Wait. Do I know you? You remind me
from someone I met in the market.
Aladdin retreated into the shadows. 'The marketplace? Why, I have
servants who go to the market for me! So it couldn't have been
me that you met.”
“No, I guess not,” Jasmine said, looking disappointed.
A bee buzzed in Aladdin's ear. He moved to crush it until he heard it
speak, with the voice of genius! “Enough about you,” he said. 'Talk about
her."
“Princess Jasmine, you are… uh, beautiful.” Aladdin said.
“Rich too,” she said. “And the sultan’s daughter.”
Aladdin smiled. "I know."
“A fine reward for any prince,” she said, playing along.
"Good! A prince like me!"
"Good! A prince like you!" Jasmine repeated. "And all the others
swaggering peacock I met. Go jump off a balcony!”
Jasmine turned and walked into her room.
“Mayday!” Mayday! » said the genie, still disguised as a bee. "Stop her!
Do you want me to poke her?”
“Get away!” Aladdin replied.
“Okay,” said the genie. “But remember: be yourself!”
"Yeah, that's right," Aladdin muttered as the genie flew under his turban.
and in the lamp.
Jasmine looked over her shoulder. "What?"
"Um...I said, you're right!" Aladdin sighed. "You...are not just a few
prizes to be won. You should be free to make your own choice. »
Depressed, Aladdin turned away. He climbed over the railing and
came down from the balcony into space.
"No!" Jasmine cried. But Aladdin did not fall: he hovered
outside.
“How do you do this?” Said Jasmine, stunned.
“It’s, uh, a magic carpet,” Aladdin said.
Jasmine looked over the railing and touched the carpet. “It’s lovely.”
“You don’t want to take a ride… do you?” Aladdin gave him a
hopeful look. "We could fly away and see the world..."
“Is it safe?” » asked Jasmine.
"Of course." Aladdin held out his hand and smiled. “Do you trust me?”
Do you trust me? Jasmine had heard those exact words before, she said
in the same way. “Yes,” she said softly, taking his hand.
She stepped on the carpet and it took off. Losing her balance, she
fell into Aladdin's arms. He blushed, but he liked the feeling – and he
I could tell Jasmine did too.
The carpet hovered above the palace. Agrabah extended below
them, a group of twinkling lights. And above
them, the stars of the desert sky blinked a thousand times as they
slipped on the sand. In the distance, the sea seemed to be made of
the blackest ink.
Swooping among the pyramids, Aladdin and Jasmine shouted with
joy. When the carpet flew through an apple orchard, Aladdin
reached out and grabbed an apple for the princess.
He threw it at her with a smirk. The relaxed turnaround, the smile;
Do you trust me? - all this sounded exactly like the boy from
walk. Was it possible?
She decided to find out. The carpet finally deposited them on the roof
from a large pagoda, and they watched fireworks in the distance.
“Everything is so… magical,” Jasmine said. "It's a shame Abu had to miss
This."
“No,” said Aladdin. "He hates fireworks. He doesn't really like flying
—"
Aladdin caught himself mid-sentence.
" It's you ! » blurted Jasmine. "Why did you lie to me! Did you think I
you wouldn't understand? »
" No ! I mean, I was hoping you wouldn’t – that’s not what I meant…”
Aladdin searched for words. His stomach turned. He couldn't let
Jasmine knows the truth. "Um... the truth is that I sometimes dress in
commoner, to escape the pressures of palace life. Yeah. But I really am Prince Ali
Ababwa!”
Jasmine looked uncertain. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
"Well, you know... royals entering the city in disguise... that seems a
a little strange, don't you think? »
Perfect! He knew he had it now. After all, she was in disguise
when he met her.
"Not so strange," she said, resting her chin on Aladdin's shoulder.
Together they watched the fireworks until they were too tired to continue.
their eyes open. The carpet then took them back to the palace,
hovering outside Jasmine's window.
Jasmine went up to the balcony, then turned to Aladdin. They
smiled at each other over the railing - until the carpet gave Aladdin a
slight nudge forward.
His lips suddenly met hers. She didn't move at all. In the soft light of
the stars, they shared a long kiss.
“Good night, my handsome prince,” she said, leaning back against her.

“Sleep well, princess,” Aladdin replied.
As she disappeared behind a curtain, Aladdin

the carpet floated to the garden, “it’s starting to look good”.
He snapped back to reality when he felt the harsh grip of rough hands.
on his shoulder. Turning around, Aladdin found himself face to face with

Before Aladdin could move, another guard put handcuffs on him.
wrists and ankles. Rasoul stuck a gag down his throat.
“Abou!” Aladdin tried to scream through the gag. “Abou, help!”
He looked around wildly until he saw Abu hanging from a tree,
tied with a thick rope. The carpet tried to fly away, but another
the guard threw him in a cage.
Jafar stepped out of the shadows. On his shoulder, Lago smiled.
“I fear you have worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo,” Jafar
hissed.
Aladdin turned around. He struggled with his chains. If only he
could reach his turban. The lamp was below and the genie
was inside the lamp.
Jafar looked calmly at the guards. “Make sure he’s never found.”
CHAPTER TEN
In the cool of the desert night, the guards rushed Aladdin towards the
sea ​​on camelback, And without a word, they pushed him off a cliff.
Aladdin dove into the water with a loud noise. In the shadow
In the moonlight he could see her turban fluttering in the distance. The lamp slowly
emerged, then fell to the bottom of the sea.
He kicked his legs, desperate to reach the lamp. He fumbled with his
hands... There he was. But his strength was leaving him. He tried
rub the lamp, but it was weak... so weak...
Splash! The genie materialized, wearing a shower cap and holding a
scrubbing brush. “Never fail,” he said. "You get into the bath and there's a
rub the lamp. Good morning?"
Instantly, his smile disappeared. Aladdin was limp.
"Al! Kid! Get out of there!" » pleaded the genie as he grabbed Aladdin. "I
I can't help you unless you make a wish. You
I have to say, “Genius, I want you to save my life!” " Got it?''
Aladdin's head tilted slightly.
“I take that as a yes!” The genie let go of Aladdin and swam into a
circle. A whirlwind formed, spinning Aladdin upwards.
He broke to the surface, coughing and struggling. Before he can
fell, the genie picked it up and flew away. "Don't scare me like
that!”, growled the genie.
Aladdin looked around excitedly. He was alive, wet and
humiliated, but alive. As they returned to Agrabah, Aladdin
looked at the smiling face of his savior.
"Genius, I...Thank you" was all he could say.
Jasmine had never been happier. She couldn't stop humming, and
she couldn't stop thinking about Aladdin.
As she undid her hair in front of the bedroom mirror, she didn't notice
his father enters, with Jafar behind him. "Jasmin...", the sultan
began.
She turned around. “Oh, Father! I have just had the most wonderful time.
I am so happy!"
The sultan looked straight ahead. “You should be, Jasmine,” he said in a hushed voice. "I chose a
husband for you.
You will marry Jafar. »
Jasmine gasped.
Jafar stepped forward. The serpent's head of his staff shone brightly,
exerts his hypnotic spell on the sultan.
"Never!" Jasmine said. “Father, I choose Prince Ali!”
Jafar laughs. "Prince Ali is gone, like all the others. But don't worry.
Wherever he went, I'm sure he caused a sensation. »
“Better check your crystal ball, Jafar!” » came a voice from
window.
Jafar turned, Lago cried out in surprise. It was Aladdin!
Jasmine ran towards him. “Prince Ali!” She cried. "Are you doing OK?"
"Yes," said Aladdin, "but no thanks to Jafar. He tried to make me
kill!"
“Your Highness,” Jafar said, “he is obviously lying.”
"Obviously... lying...", the sultan repeated mechanically.
“Dad, what’s wrong with you?” » Jasmine said in dismay.
Aladdin crossed the room towards Jafar. "I know
What's wrong?" He snatched Jafar's staff and broke it
snake head on the ground.
"Oh! Oh my God..." said the sultan, shaking his head. “I feel so strange.”
“Your Highness,” Aladdin said, holding the broken staff aloft.
“Jafar controls you with this!”
The Sultan's eyes narrowed. "Jafarl You, traitor! Guards! Arrest
Jafar immediately!”
But Jafar had noticed something he hadn't noticed before:
The magic lamp came out of Aladdin's turban! He rushed towards
but the sultan's guards seized it.
“It’s not over yet, boy!” Jafar said. Reaching for his dress, he
took out a magic pellet and threw it on the ground. In a cloud of smoke,
He and Lago were gone.
"Find it!" » shouted the sultan to his guards. "I can't believe it! Jafar,
my trusted advisor, plotting against me! »
His shocked expression turned into a smile as he turned to
Jasmine and Aladdin. " Is it possible ? My daughter finally chose one
suitor?"
Jasmine nodded and the Sultan threw his arms around Aladdin.
"Oh, you're a brilliant boy! You two will be married
immediately! You will be happy, prosperous – and then you, my boy, will be
become sultan! »
Sultan I Aladdin swallowed nervously. It was supposed to be the
happiest moment of his life, but he was suddenly very worried.
Lago flew over Jafar's laboratory in a blind panic. "We have to get out of
here!” he said. “I have to pack my bags!”
But Jafar was deep in thought. He suddenly burst out laughing and
he grabbed Lago by the throat. "Prince All is nothing more than that
Aladdin, the kid in rags! » he said. “He has the lamp, lago!”
Lago's eyes narrowed. "Well, this little cheater—"
“But you’re going to get rid of it!” » Jafar said with a sinister smile.
"Listen carefully."
Lago leaned in as Jafar muttered his master plan.
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Aladdin was given the most comfortable suite in the palace, but he
I barely slept that night. At dawn he paced back and forth,
holding his turban, the lamp inside. Abu and the carpet were sitting outside
by the window, looking at him worriedly.
“Huzz!” » cried the genie as he came out of the lamp. "Aladdin, you have
just won the princess's heart! What are you going to do next?''
He lowered his voice to a whisper. "Psst. Your next line is: "I'm going
to free the genius!”
“Genie,” said Aladdin sadly, “I'm sorry, but I can't. They want
make me a sultan – no, they want to make Prince Ali a sultan. The only
The reason anyone thinks I'm worth anything is because of you! And if
they discover the truth? What if Jasmine found out? She's going to hate me."
Aladdin looked at the genie's pale and disappointed face. “Genius, I
need you. Without you, I'm just Aladdin."
The genie tried to control his anger. "I understand.
After all, you lied to everyone. Hey, I was starting to feel
excluded. Now, if you’ll excuse me….”
With that, he disappeared into the lamp.
“Genie,” Aladdin cried, “I’m so sorry.”
The genie's lips protruded from the beak and shaved it.
"GOOD!" » Snapped Aladdin, throwing a pillow at the lamp. 'So just
stay in there!" As he strode away, he could see Abu and the carpet
looking at him from the window. “What are you guys looking at?”
As Abu and the carpet turned away. Jasmine's voice came from
menagerie. "Ali? Will you come here please? Hurry up!"
“I’m coming, Jasmine!” Aladdin shouted out the window.
He rushed outside. As he ran towards the menagerie towards
Through Jasmine's voice, he came across a group of flamingos in a pond.
At least they all looked like flamingos.
Lago snickered inwardly. Her Jasmine impersonation had worked – and
her flamingo disguise was perfect, thanks to Jafar's magic. When
Aladdin was gone, he rushed into the empty room and quickly flew
the lamp. Hooking it with its beak, it flew outside and came straight back
at Jafar's laboratory.
"AH! There you are." » said Jasmine. "I looked everywhere
You!"
Aladdin turned around, perplexed. Abu and the carpet rushed towards
for her part, Jasmine was running towards him. But how could she
she "looked everywhere" when she had just—
“Hurry up,” she said, taking his hand. "Father is about to make
the announcement of the marriage."
They climbed the stairs of a tower that overlooked the courtyard.
Townspeople blocked every square inch desperately trying to see the
royal couple. Jasmine climbed onto the platform and took her place
next to his father. Smiling, the sultan announced to the crowd:
“Ladies and gentlemen, my daughter has chosen a suitor: Prince Ali
Ababwa!”
CHAPTER TWELVE
In another tower that overlooked the palace
courtyard, Jafar and Lago watched Aladdin prepare to
in front of the roaring crowd.
“Look at them cheering for that little squeaker!” cried Lago.
“Let them clap,” said Jafar, holding the lamp tightly and beginning to
rub it. “Finally,” he said. “The power is mine!”
In a cloud of smoke, the genie appeared. "Al, if you want
Excuse me, I…” The genie’s jaw dropped when he saw Jafar.
"I am your master now!" Jafar said.
"I was afraid of that-"
"Keep quiet!" Jafar snapped. "And now, slave, grant me my first
wish. I wish to be sultan! »
As Aladdin watched from the platform, the crowd
became foggy. The clouds swirled above the palace and with great heartbreak

the platform was torn off. Jasmine and Aladdin looked around.
confusion as a strange magical light engulfs the Sultan. And when he
arrested, the sultan was on the ground – in his underwear! The crowd
gasped.
There was someone else on the stand now – someone tall, dark and
dressed in the sultan's robes. He held a snake staff in his right hand.
“Jafar!” Aladdin exclaimed.
Jafar turned with a sneer. “Sultan Jafar to you!”
“What kind of hoax is this?” » asked the sultan.
“The keepers of the finders,” Jafar said. “I have the ultimate power now!”
A shadow fell across the courtyard. Everyone looked up.
Aladdin's breath caught in his throat. Abu and the carpet grabbed
each other with terror. Towering over them like an evil giant was the
genius. He placed his hands on the roof of his mouth as if he were going to crush it.

“Genie, stop!” Aladdin shouted. "What are you doing?"
The genie's eyes were full of sadness. “Sorry, kid,” he said. "I have one
new master now.
With a mighty heave he lifted the entire palace.
floor. Agrabah residents scattered, screaming as debris fell
around them. The genie then flew to a mountain above the city.
and I established the palace there.
Jafar let out a deep, triumphant laugh. "Now you're miserable
wretches, bow before me! »
“We will never bow to you!” Jasmine replied. Aladdin and the Sultan
stood by his side.
“Then you will cower!” " said Jafar. He turned to face the
genius. “My second wish is to be the most powerful wizard in the world.
world!"
His snake staff began to glow and green lightning crackled around him.
Rajah let out a roar and lunged at Jafar. Jafar waved his staff, and
outside. Rajah has been transformed into a kitten. As Rajah landed softly
on his paws, Jafar looked at Jasmine and Aladdin. "Take a look at
your precious prince Ali – or should we say, Alad-din! »
A flash of light burst from the staff. He surrounded Aladdin and Abu.
Instantly, Abu became a monkey again. Aladdin's dress, slippers and slippers
the turban has disappeared. He fell to the ground, dressed in his old rags. "He is
nothing more than a lying, worthless street rat!”
Jasmine looked at him, confused and hurt. “Ali!”
“Face it, boy, you don’t belong here,” Jafar said.
"Um, where does it belong? Could it be... the ends of the earth?" lake
mocked.
“Work for me!” » Jafar shouted, waving his staff again.
Aladdin and Abu suddenly levitated off the ground and into the open air.
window of a narrow tower. In an instant, the tower soared above the
horizon. The carpet ran after him.
Jasmine watched in horror as the tower disappeared into the horizon.
The genie turned away sadly.
With a sly laugh, Jafar shouted, "Finally!" Agra-bah is mine!

CHAPTER THREE
When Aladdin woke up, he was cold, freezing cold. Like him
out of a snow bank, an icy wind whipped the snow into
his face.
Where was he? Through the raging blizzard he could see the tower
lying in pieces, half covered with snow. Just beyond, a cliff plunged
down into the darkness.
An accident...that was all he remembered. It had to be thrown away
out of the tower, unconscious.
A brown ball caught his attention. “Abou!” He called
chattering teeth. He ran and pulled his pet out of the snow. "Are
How's it going?"
Shivering, Abu nodded weakly.
Aladdin tucked Abu in his jacket. "Oh, Abu, this is all my fault. I
I should have freed the genie when I had the chance. Somehow I
I need to go back and set things straight. »
He felt a tickling sensation on his leg. Spinning
around, he saw the carpet moving towards him. He was caught
under a huge piece of the tower.
Aladdin tried to free the mat, but he was firmly stuck. Him and
Abu began to dig a trench around it, but the tower began to wobble.
"Attention!" Aladdin shouted. The tower began to roll towards them.
Quickly calculating, Aladdin slipped away, wrapping Abu in his arms. THE
the tower rolled over them, right where there was an opening window.
Unharmed, they saw the tower plunge over the cliff.
Freed from the tower, the carpet picked up Aladdin and Abu and
flew above the clouds.
“Very good,” Aladdin shouted. “Now let’s get back to Agra-bah!”
Jafar loved the view from his new throne room. The palace was
where he now belonged – on top of a mountain, not among the
populace. He happily sipped his glass of wine while the genie
massaged his feet. The former sultan is now suspended from
ceiling like a puppet. He was dressed in a jester's costume, and Jafar
and Lago sneered at this ridiculous spectacle. Rajah, still a kitten, paces
anxiously in a cage.
Jasmine sat at the window, her wrists chained, her eyes filled with
sadness.
Jafar contacted his team. He put the chains on him and pulled
its proximity. "It hurts me to see you reduced to this. Jasmine. You
should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.
with a wave of his staff, he made his chains disappear. A crown appeared on
her head. "Well, with you as queen—"
Jasmine picked up her glass and threw the wine in his face. "Never!"
Jafar jumped from the throne. “Anger, anger. Jasmine", growled
Jafar. "You know what's going on
when you behave badly. I’m going to teach you some respect!”
He glared at the genie. "Genius, I decided to make my last wish
—I wish Princess Jasmine would fall hopelessly in love with me!”
"No!" » Jasmine said, stepping back.
"Uh, Master," said the genie, "I can't do that—"
“You will do as I order you to do, slave!” Jafar roared as he
grabbed the genie's beard.
No one noticed Aladdin and Abu peeking into the throne room.
window behind them – no one except Jasmine.
She was about to scream when Aladdin silenced her.
with a finger on the mouth. He, Abu and the carpet climbed
silently in the room.
Jasmine thought quickly. “Jafar,” she said with a seductive smile, “I
I never realized how incredibly beautiful you are!”
Jafar turned around. His jaw was hanging open in disbelief – just like the
that of genius.
“That’s better,” Jafar said. He sidled up to Jasmine, a cocky smile
on his face. “Now tell me more about…myself.”
"You're tall, dark..." Jasmine could see Aladdin, Abu and the carpet
sneaking towards the lamp. Now the genie saw them too. It was
trying to stifle excited laughter.
“Continue…” Jafar said.
Abu was now inches from Lago – and Lago was turning around.
Jasmine quickly wrapped her arms around Jafar, locking him in place.
“You are well dressed,” she continued. "You stole my heart"
With a quick leap, Abu grabbed Lago from his perch and held out his hand.
on his mouth. They both fell to the ground.
“And the street rat?” » said Jafar, moving closer to Jasmine.
“What street rat?” asked Jasmine,
Crasshhh! Abu and Lago bumped into a table, sending a pot to the
ground.
Jafar started to turn around. Jasmine had no choice but to pull him closer
and kiss him passionately and on the lips.
Now was Aladdin's opportunity to act. But he couldn't move. All that he
all I could do was watch. There she was, the girl he had risked for
his life, kiss him... him,
Jafar stepped back. He was stunned with joy, until he saw the reflection
of Aladdin in Jasmine's crown.
"You!" he said, turning around in blind rage. His arm was broken
forward, pointing his staff at Aladdin.
Zzzzzzzap! A flash of light struck Aladdin in the chest. He was flying
backwards, crashing into a pile of jewelry.
“How many times must I kill you, boy!” Jafar said, pulling his
arm back for a second shot.
Jamsine threw herself at him, throwing his arm away.
“You deceitful shrew!” Jafar growled. “Your time is up!”
He turned his staff towards Jasmine. Instantly she was trapped in a
giant hourglass. The upper room was full of sand, and little by little
knocked down by the opening
on her. There was more than enough to bury her alive.
Zzzzzap! With a flick of his stick, Jafar transformed Abu into a cymbal-clacking toy monkey.
Zzzzzap! The carpet began to unravel. Aladdin ran to stop him. Jafar
” shouted, “Things are changing quickly, boy.
"It's all your fault, street rat! You should never have come back!"
Zzzzzzzap! Aladdin jumped back. A sword struck the ground
next to him, then another. He looked up. Dozens of razors
swords fell from the ceiling.
Jafar made another gesture and a wall of fire erupted from the ground.
Aladdin grabbed one of the fallen swords. "Are you afraid to beat me
yourself, you cowardly serpent? » said Aladdin, pushing the swords away.
as they fell.
Jafar walked towards Aladdin, forcing him closer to the fire.
"A snake, right? Perhaps you would like to see how much like a snake I can look!"
Jafar held out his serpent staff in both hands. He started to grow,
taking on a hideous life, enveloping Jafar himself in its skin. Swelling,
hissing, Jafar became a monstrous
cobra, head raised towards the ceiling. The flames rose with him,
becoming a ring of mortal coils surrounding Aladdin.
With an unearthly roar, Jafar rushed forward. Aladdin swung his sword.
Shine! He struck two of Jafar's fangs, which fell to the ground with a crash.
"Rickum-rackum, thrust this sword into this serpent", the genie
shouted.
“Stay out of this!” » » Jafar hissed. He lunged again, striking
Aladdin on the ground. The sword flew from his hand.
“Ali!” » cried the sultan, looking helplessly from above. "Jasmine!"
Aladdin walked away, seeing the hourglass. Sand
had stood up quickly, covering everything except Jasmine's head.
Without his sword, there was only one chance. Aladdin ran for the
window and jumped onto the balcony. Jafar slipped behind him. Quickly
Aladdin came running back, then escaped through another window.
Jafar followed him from window to window, entangling his long body in a
node. He screamed in pain.
Aladdin picked up his sword and ran towards the hourglass.
Jasmine's nose was barely above the sand, her eyes wide with fear.
Aladdin withdrew the sword, ready to shatter the glass.
With a resounding boom, Jafar brought down the wall. He was free...
and he cast his coils around Aladdin.
Aladdin's sword was caught in mid-flight. He had difficulty freeing himself.
“You thought you could outsmart the most powerful being on the planet!”
» Jafar shouted.
Aladdin twisted left and right. In a corner of the room, the genius
looked helpless.
The genius!
Thinking quickly, Aladdin said, "You are not that powerful. The genie has
more power than you will ever have! He gave you your power, and he
I can take it off!”
The genie hid behind a pillar. "Al, what are you doing? Why
Are you dragging me into this? »
“Face it, Jafar, you’re still only second,” Aladdin continued.
Jafar loosened his bonds. He turned his slimy face towards the genie.
"You're right. His power surpasses mine, but not for long!"
Aladdin fell to the ground as Jafar slid across the ground.
bedroom. "Slave!" Jafar called the genie. "I'm ready to do my third
wish. I wish to be... an all-powerful genius!”
The genie looked at Aladdin, his blue face now white as chalk. "Your
“I wish,” he said in a little wavering voice, “that’s my order!”
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
The genie made a gesture. A swirling current of energy encircled
Jafar, and he began to change form. The fire has disappeared. Her
the body of the cobra became wider and wider until it took on the roundness
of a genius. "Yes!" » Jafar shouted. 'The power! Absolute power!”
Quickly, Aladdin picked up his sword and shattered the hourglass.
Jasmine slid forward with the sand cascading. “What do you have
Is it done?”, she asked as Aladdin released her.
Aladdin smiled. 'Trust me."
“The universe is an open book before me!” Jafar shouted. "Mine
command, control!" The palace dome exploded as Jafar stood up
to the sky.
Before he could say another word, golden chains tightened around his body.
wrists, just like those worn by the genie. A lamp began to materialize
beneath him, new and shiny.
"What? What's going on?" » asked Jafar.
“You wanted to be a genius?” Aladdin picked up the new lamp and
handed it to Jafar. “You got it, and everything that goes with it!”
Jafar's legs were nothing but a trail of vapor, a trail that disappeared into the
the nozzle of the lamp. "No!" » he said, his eyes bulging with terror.
“Noooooooo!”
Screaming in anguish, Jafar raised his hand. Their fingers
he squeezed Lago's feet. "What... hey! Let go!" Lago shouted.
With a dull noise! Jafar and Lago were sucked into the lamp.
Everyone in the throne room fell into an awesome silence. Jasmine, the
sultan, and the genie looked at Aladdin.
“Phenomenal cosmic powers,” Aladdin said with a shrug. "Toddler
living space!"
The genie let out a big laugh. “Al, you little genius!”
Instantly, the room began to return to normal. Back on his feet, the
The Sultan sighed in pleasure as his robes materialized on him. Abu
became a living monkey again. Rajah became a tiger again, breaking
freed from his little cage. And the carpet looked brand new.
The genie grabbed the lamp and headed towards the balcony.
"Shall we go? Ten thousand years spent in the Cave of Wonders should chill us
“He turned and threw the lamp, sending it flying end over end.
towards the desert.
Smiling proudly, the genie flew outside. It took on a gigantic form,
picked up the whole palace and began to return it to its rightful place
place.
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Later in the day, when Agrabah had returned to
normal. Jasmine and Aladdin stood in the throne room
balcony.
"Jasmine," Aladdin said softly, "I'm sorry for lying to you...about being
a prince."
Jasmine nodded. “I know why you did it.”
"I guess...this is goodbye?"
Jasmine turned away. "This stupid law! It's not fair!" Slowly,
in tears, she faced Aladdin again. "I love you."
Suddenly, the genie appears through the window. “Al, no problem—
You only have one wish left. Just say the word and you will become a prince again!”
“But Genie,” said Aladdin. “And your freedom?”
"Al, you're in love. You won't find another girl like this in a
millions of years. Believe me, I looked.”
Aladdin looked from the genie to Jasmine. He knew how much
freedom now meant. Not only to Genius but to Jasmine – and to
himself. Just like she needed
to be free from the sultan's laws, Aladdin also had to be free. Free to be
himself.
“Jasmine…I love you,” he finally said. "But I can't pretend to be
something I am not.
Jasmine lowered her head. "I understand."
“Genie,” said Aladdin, “I wish for your freedom. It is time that I
I started keeping my promises.
In a flash, the genie's golden cuffs disappeared. He was stunned. "Fast!
Wish for something, anything! Say: “I want the Nile!” »
“Uh, I wish for the Nile,” Aladdin said.
"CERTAINLY NOT!" said the genie, laughing. "I'm free!" he shouted, his
face lighting up. "I'm free! I'm off to discover the world!"
"Congratulations!" » said the sultan, looking behind him.
“Qenie, I’m going to miss you,” Aladdin said.
"Me too, Al," the genie replied with an affectionate smile. "No matter what
everyone says, you will always be a prince to me! »
"That's right!" the sultan accepted.
"You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned. If it's the law that's the problem, then what's going on?"
what we need is a new law!”
Jasmine looked at him, stunned. "Father!"
“From this day on, the princess will marry whoever she deems worthy!”
“I choose you, Aladdin!” Jasmine cried instantly.
Aladdin was delighted. “Call me Al,” he said.
He and Jasmine burst out laughing.
Aladdin took her in his arms and they both began to spin around the balcony.
"GOOD!" said the genie with a big smile, "I can't do any more damage around here.
And now I'm getting out of here!
Goodbye, you crazy lovebirds! »
Like a rocket, the genius launched into the sky.
The sultan followed him with his eyes until the genie disappeared on the horizon.
Aladdin and Jasmine didn't even notice him leaving.
As they shared a long, dreamy kiss, they didn't notice much except each other.


ALADDIN: THE COMPLETE SCRIPT

PEDGER: Oh, I come from a country
    From a distant place
    Where the camels of the caravan roam
    Where your ear was cut off / Where it's flat and immense
    If they don't like your face / And the heat is intense
    It's barbaric, but hey, it's my home!
    When the wind is at your back
    And the sun comes from the west
    And the sand in the glass is right
    Come down,
    Stop
    Jump on a mat and fly
    Towards another Arab night!

    Arabian nights
    Like the Arab days
    Most of the time
    Are hotter than hot
    In many ways

    Arabian nights
    'Neath Arab moons
    A fool out of his custody
    Could fall and fall hard
    Over there, on the dunes.

    Ah, Salaam and good evening to you, worthy friend.
    Please, please come closer--(Camera zooms in and hits
    peddler in front) Too close, a little too close. (Camera
    zooms out to CU) There. Welcome to Agrabah. City of
    mystery, enchantment and the most beautiful merchandise of this
    side of the Jordan, on sale today, come down!
    Eh eh. Look at this! Yes! Hookah and combination
    coffee maker - also makes julienne fries. Won't break
    (he slaps it on the table), won't do it--(he collapses)--he
    broken. Ooohhh! Look at this! comes out Tupperware) I
    I've never seen one intact before. It's the
    famous Tupperware from the Dead Sea. Listen. (Forces him to open it,
    makes a raspberry sound.) Ah, it's always good. (Camera starts
    to pan right. PEDDLER rushes to catch it.) Wait,
    do not go ! (Stop panning.) I can see you're only
    interested in the exceptionally rare. I think then, you
    would be very rewarded to consider... this. (PEDLER
    takes out the MAGIC LAMP from his sleeve.) Don't be
    deceived by his banal appearance. Like so many others
    things, it's not what's on the outside, but what's on the inside
    it counts. (Another pan, this one slower to the left.
    Once again, PEDDLER rushes to catch up.) This is not ordinary.
    lamp! It changed the course of a young man's life.
    A young man who loved this lamp was more than he
    seemed. A diamond in the rough. Maybe you would like
    to hear the story? (PEDDLER pours bright sand from
    lamp in his hand.) It begins with a dark night (PEDDLER
    throws sand into the sky, where it forms a starry sky
    night landscape.), where a dark man waits, with a dark
    aim.

(Camera tilts to find JAFAR sitting on his horse and IAGO
    on his shoulder. GAZEEM arrives towards the two.)

JAFAR: You...are late.
GAZEEM: A thousand apologies, oh patient.
JAFAR: Do you have it then?
GAZEEM: I had to cut a few throats to get it. (Comes out
        half of the medallion. JAFAR is looking for him,
        but GAZEEM pulls it back.) Ah, ah, ahhh! The treasure!
        (IAGO shouts as he passes and grabs the medallion.) Ouch!
JAFAR: Believe me, my spicy friend. You'll get what it is
        comes to you.
IAGO: What's wrong with you! Awk!

(JAFAR takes out the second half of the medallion. He connects
    them, and the insect medallion begins to glow. Finally, he
    flies out of JAFAR's hands, frightening the horses, and leaves
    towards the dunes.)

JAFAR: Quick, follow the trail!

(Everyone leaves, following the light point, until
    we reach a large dune. It separates in two and
    the halves plunge into the dune. Only two brilliants left
    points of light on the dune. But then the dune starts to rise
     transforming into a giant lion's head, with the brilliant
    points serving as eyes.)

JAFAR: Finally, after all my years of research, the cave
        wonderful things !
IAGO: Awk! Cave of wonders!
GAZEEM: By Allah!
JAFAR: Now remember! Bring me the lamp. The rest of the
        the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!

(GAZEEM begins to approach the lion's mouth, which forms the
    entrance to the cave. He laughs as he walks.)

IAGO: Awk, the lamp! Awk, the lamp! (Now that IAGO and
    JAFAR is alone, IAGO opens in normal English.)
    Damn, where did you find this asshole?

(JAFAR puts his finger to his lips and silences him. GAZEEM reaches
    the cave, but is blown away by the roar of the cave's words.)

CAVE: Who disturbs my sleep?
GAZEEM: It's me, Gazeem, a humble thief.
CAVE: Know it. Only one can enter here. The one whose
        the value lies far within. A diamond in the rough.

(GAZEEM turns to JAFAR with a questioning look.)

JAFAR: What are you waiting for? Keep on going!

(GAZEEM hesitates, then advances one foot inside the cave. With
    great apprehension, he plants his foot. Nothing happens.
      Relieved, he resumes his journey. Then another roar comes.
     He turns around, but the lion's mouth closes and the dune
    returns to normal. All that remains is JAFAR, IAGO,
     and the two separated halves of the medallion.)

CAVE: Look for yourself, the diamond in the rough.

(IAGO extricated himself from the sand while coughing.)

IAGO: I can't believe it. I just don't believe it. Were
        I will never get my hands on that stupid lamp! Just
        forget that. Look at this. Look at this. I am so
        ticked that I am molting! (He flies up
        JAFAR's shoulder.)
JAFAR: Patience, Iago. Patience. Gazeem was obviously
        less than worthy.
IAGO: (extremely sarcastic) Oh, there's a big
        surprise. It's amazing - I think I'm going to have
        a heart attack and die without surprise! What is this
        we will do ? We have a big problem here, a big problem-
        (JAFAR pinches his beak.)
JAFAR: Yes, we do. Only one can enter. I have to find this
        one, this... diamond in the rough.

(Cut to a roof, where ALADDIN rushes to the edge, carrying
    a slice of bread. He almost drops it overboard.)

GUARD: Stop, thief! I'll have your hands for a trophy,
        street rat!
ALADDIN: (He looks back, then down, then towards the bread.) Everything
        that for a loaf of bread?

(He jumps and lands on two ropes stretched between the buildings, with
    dry clothes on it. He goes through them, collecting pieces
    and pieces of clothing on him as he walks. Finally, he is
    approaching the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches
     outside and slams the shutters. ALADDIN hits the
    shutters and falls into the street, his fall being interrupted by
    many awnings and the pile of clothes around him. He shoots
     takes off the top layer of his clothes and gets ready to enjoy his bread
    When...)

GUARD 1: There he is!
GUARD 2: You won't get away so easily!
ALADDIN: Do you think it was easy?

(He looks at three women and makes fun of him.)

GUARD 1: You two, this way, and you, with me. GOOD
        find it.

(ALADDIN puts a sheet over himself and wraps himself up to disguise himself.
    He rushes towards the women.)

ALADDIN: Hello, ladies.
WOMAN 1: You're in trouble a little early today, aren't you?
        us Aladdin?
ALADDIN: A problem? Certainly not. You only get in trouble if you
        get caught--

(A hand grabs ALADDIN's shoulder and pulls him back. It's the
    first GUARD. ALADDIN's disguise falls off.)

ALADDIN: I'm in trouble!
GUARD: ...and this time--(A screaming sound from ABU,
        then the guard's turban is lowered on his
        eyes. ABU dances on the GUARD's head, laughing.)
ALADDIN: Perfect timing, Abu!
ABU: Hello!
ALADDIN: Come on, let's get out of here!
        I have to stay... one jump ahead of the finish line
        One step ahead of the sword
        I only steal what I can't afford
        That's all!

(ALADDIN fights a GUARD wielding a sword. He dodges a few
    swings, then pulls down the GUARD's pants. ABU raspberries
    GUARD, then dodge an attack. The GUARD swings over ALADDIN,
    but destroys a barrel of fish. As ALADDIN FUNDS, GUARDS HIM
     pulls a fish on its lower body like pants.)

        A jump ahead of the lawmen
        That's it, and it's not a joke
        These guys don't like me being broke!

(ALADDIN and ABU run over a pile of barrels, then knock over one.
    above another GUARD.)

GUARDS: (one at a time) Riffraff! Street rat!
        Scoundrel! Take that!
ALADDIN: Just a little snack, guys!

(ALADDIN runs to the top of a platform. The GUARDS shake the
    platform moves back and forth trying to knock it down.)

GUARDS: Rip it up, take it back guys!
ALADDIN: I can take a clue, I have to face the facts
        You are my only friend, Abu!
WOMEN: Who?!?

(ALADDIN jumps from the platform to certain death, only to catch ABU's.
    hands like an acrobat. The couple turns into a harem.)

        Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom
        He has become a single man who increases crime

(ABU finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth with it like a
    chipmunk.)

WOMAN: I would blame the parents, but he doesn't have them!
ALADDIN: I must eat to live, I must fly to eat
        I'll tell you all about it when I have time!

(ALADDIN and ABU exit. Cut to MUSCLEMAN leaning towards the crowd. The
    The GUARDS rush. Cut to ALADDIN and ABU behind the MUSCLEMAN,
     matching his movements, until they make a mistake and are discovered.)

        A jump ahead of slowpokes
        One step ahead of my loss
        Next time I'll use a pen name.
        A jump ahead of the hitmen
        One step ahead of the herd
        I think I'll take a walk around the neighborhood.

(A chase sequence, in which ALADDIN and ABU, pursued by the GUARDS,
    running through a herd of sheep, overcoming an obstacle to a MAN sleeping on a bed of
    nails {of course, an extremely large GUARD lands on him}. HAS DRUNK
     disguises himself with jewelry until a MERCHANT discovers him.

CROWD: Stop, thief! Vandal!
        Outrage! Scandal!
ALADDIN: Let's not be in too much of a hurry

(ALADDIN is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens
    and a big, ugly LADY comes out.)

LADY: Still, I think it's pretty tasty

(ALADDIN tumbles, then puts his arm around a GUARD, acting like
    as if they were all friends.)

ALADDIN: I must eat to live, I must fly to eat
        Otherwise we would get along well!
GUARDS: WRONG!

(They all jump in a pile and fight. When they stop, ALADDIN and
    ABU left. They escape in barrels. They run
    through a burning pit, followed by GUARDS jumping up and down,
    screaming in pain as they broke through the rocks. ALADDIN and ABU
    pass u a SWORD SWALLOWER, then ABU comes back, draws the sword
    out of the mouth of the SWALLOWER. ABU advances on the guards,
    who shrink back in fear.)

GUARD 1: He has a sword!
GUARD 2: You idiot, we ALL have swords!!

(ABU gently puts down the sword, then runs. ALADDIN and ABU are
    once again surrounded, with GUARDS coming from left and right.
      He jumps and climbs on a dress ride that is done in the street,
     as the GUARDS all crash into each other.)

ALADDIN: One step ahead of the beating of hooves!
CROWD: Vandal!
ALADDIN: One jump ahead of the hump!
CROWD: Street rats!
ALADDIN: A Ride Before Disaster
CROWD: Scoundrel!
ALADDIN: They are fast, but I am much faster
CROWD: Take that!

(The GUARDS chase ALADDIN up a staircase into a room. He catches a
     carpet and jump out the window)

ALADDIN: There you go, I better put my hand in
        Wish me a safe landing
        All I have to do is jump!

(The GUARDS follow him out the window, but they go straight down to
     the street, and land in a heap with the sign "Crazy Hakim's
    Discount Fertilizer." ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute
    land safely and out of danger. ALADDIN and ABU congratulate each other
    other.)

ALADDIN: And now, esteemed effendi, we feast! All right!

(ALADDIN breaks the bread in two and gives half to ABU, who begins
    eat. But ALADDIN looks and sees two young children
    rummage through trash to find food. The GIRL sees it, then
    drops his find and tries to hide. ALADDIN looks at them, then
    bread, then to ABU.)

ABU: Uh-oh!

(ABU takes a big bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks
    to children. The GIRL removes her brother.)

ALADDIN: Here, go on, take it.

(The children laugh with joy. ABU tries to swallow his mouthful,
    then he looks guilty. He walks towards the children and offers them his
     bread for them. Delighted, they stroke him on the head.)

ABU: Ah, don't do it. Eh?

(ABU sees ALADDIN entering the daylight, where there is a parade
    continues.ALADDIN looks over people's shoulders. He see
    PRINCE ACHMED on horseback.)

PASSENGER 1: On the way to the palace, I suppose.
BYSTANDER 2: Another suitor for the princess.

(ALADDIN is surprised as the two children run out of the room.
    alley. The BOY runs in front of the PRINCE's horse,
    surprising him.)

PRINCE: Get out of my way, you brat!

(The PRINCE raises his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN
    jump in front of them and grab the whip.)

ALADDIN: Hey, if I was as rich as you, I could afford certain manners
PRINCE: Oh... I'm teaching you some manners!

(The PRINCE throws ALADDIN into a mud puddle. The crowd laughs at him.)

ALADDIN: Look at that, Abu. It's not every day you see a
        horse with two hindquarters!

(The PRINCE stops and turns towards ALADDIN.)

PRINCE: You are a worthless street rat. You were born a
        street rat, you will die street rat, and only
        your fleas will cry for you.

(ALADDIN rushes at the PRINCE, but the castle doors close
    in his face.)

ALADDIN: I am not useless. And I don't have fleas. Come
        Go on, Abu. Let's go home.

(ALADDIN walks up to his house with the view, then returns
    ABU for the night.)

ALADDIN: Riffraff, street rat.
        I don't buy that.
        If only they looked closer
        Would they see a poor boy? No father.
        They would find out, there is so much more to me.

(He pulls back a curtain to reveal the magnificent palace.)

        One day, Abu, things will change. Well-being
        rich, I live in a palace and I never have problems
        at all.

(Dissolve in the same plane during the day. Interior shot of the SULTAN's bedroom.
     The door suddenly opens and PRINCE ACHMED bursts in, missing the
    the back of his pants.)

PRINCE: I have never been so insulted!

SULTAN: Oh, Prince Ahmed. You're not leaving that early, are you?
        You ?

PRINCE: Good luck marrying her!

SULTAN: Oh, Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine! (The SULTAN leaves
        goes into the garden in search of his daughter. He
        finds her, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE's son.
        pet tiger, which blocks it. RAJAH has a piece
        of the PRINCE's underpants in his mouth.The SULTAN
        grabs the cloth and removes it from RAJAH's mouth.)
        To hell with it, Rajah! This is why Prince Ahmed
        slammed!
JASMINE: Oh, father. Rajah was just playing with him,
        were you not Rajah. (RAJAH approaches and allows
        JASMINE to pet and hug him.) You were just playing
        with this overdressed and egocentric Prince Ahmed,
        is not it ? (She snuggles up against RAJAH, enjoying the
        moment, until she looked up at her angry father. )
        Hmm.
SULTAN: Dearest, you must stop rejecting all suitors
        who comes to call. The law tells you...
BOTH: ...must be married to a prince.

(They head towards a dove cage.)

SULTAN: Until your next birthday.
JASMINE: The law is false.
SULTAN: You only have three days left!
JASMINE: Father, I hate having to do this. (She takes
        a dove out of the cage and caresses it.) If I get married,
        I want it to be out of love.
SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not just this law. (She hands him
        the dove, and he puts it back in the cage.) I am not
        It's going to be there forever, and I just want to do
        sure you are taken care of, expected.
JASMINE: Try to understand. I never did anything to my
        own. (She swirls her finger in the water
        pond, petting the fish.) I never had a real
        friends. (RAJAH looks at her and growls.)
        Except you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he returns to
        sleep.) I never even left the palace
        walls.
SULTAN: But Jasmine, you are a princess.
JASMINE: So maybe I don't want to be a princess. (She
        splashes the water.)
SULTAN: Oooohhh! Allah protect you
        girls !

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second. JASMINE walks towards the dove.
    cage and pull to open the door. The birds fly away to freedom.
      She watches them leave. Cut to int. of the SULTAN apartments.)

SULTAN: I don't know where she got that from. His mother
        wasn't that difficult. (A shadow falls over him.
        He looks up in surprise and sees JAFAR.) Ooh, oh.
        Ah, Jafar, my most trusted advisor. I'm in
        in desperate need of your wisdom.
JAFAR: My life is only to serve you, my lord. (He bows.)
SULTAN: It's this suitor thing. Jasmine refuses to
        choose a husband. I'm at the end of my tether.
IAGO: (in parrot voice) Awk! End of the roller.
SULTAN: Oh, ha, ha. Have fun, pretty Polly! (He
        takes a cracker from his pocket. IAGO looks
        terrified. Then the SULTAN puts it in that of IAGO
        mouth. IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it. JAFAR
        and the SULTAN both laugh.)
JAFAR: Your Majesty certainly has trouble with stupid animals.
        (IAGO looks at him.) Now maybe I can
        guess a solution to this thorny problem.
SULTAN: If anyone can help, it's you.
JAFAR: Ah, but that would require the use of mystic blue
        diamond.
SULTAN: Uh, my ring? But it's been in the family ever since
        years.
JAFAR: We must find a suitor for the princess.
        (JAFAR pronounces the word "princess" with the emphasis on
        the second syllable, "cess". He turns his stick
        with a cobra head towards the SULTAN. The eyes of
        the stick begins to glow. The room darkens, that of JAFAR
        the voice slowed and deepened. The eyes of the SULTAN
        get a hypnotized look.) Don't worry. All
        wiil be good.
SULTAN: Everything will be fine.
JAFAR: The diamond.
SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Everything you need will be fine.

(The SULTAN takes off his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns
    to normal as JAFAR removes the stick.)

JAFAR: You are very kind, my liege. Now run and
        play with your little toys.
SULTAN: (Still hypnotized) Yes... it will be... pretty good.

(JAFAR and IAGO come out. We follow them. When they leave the room,
    the parrot spits out the cracker.)

IAGO: I can't take it anymore! If I have to choke
        another one of those moldy, disgusting crackers... bam!
        Beat!

(JAFAR pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.)

JAFAR: Calm down, Iago.
IAGO: Then I grabbed him by the head. Beat! Beat!
JAFAR: (speaking about IAGO.) Soon I will be sultan, not
        this confused idiot.
IAGO: And then I shove the crackers down his throat! Ha
        Ha!

(The couple goes through a door and slams it. Diss. towards the gardens outside.
    the night. A dark figure walks through. We see that it's JASMINE
    disguised. She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it.
      She is pulled from behind by RAJAH.)

JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here and
        May my life be lived for me. I'll miss you. (She
        starts to climb again, and is helped by RAJAH,
        who starts to whine and moan.) Goodbye!

(She disappears over the wall. Shot of the day in ALADDIN street
    and ABU are ready to get into mischief again. They are at the top of the
    awning of a fruit stand.)

ALADDIN: Okay, Abu. Go!

(ABU dives overboard and looks at the OWNER.)

OWNER: (To passing crowd) Try this, your taste buds
            will dance and sing. (ABU catches a melon and
            is hanging there, distracting his attention.) Hey,
            get your paws off that.
ABU: Blah blah blah!
OWNER: Well, you! Get away from here, you dirty monkey!

(He snatches the melon from ABU's hands. But in the foreground, ALADDIN
    bends down and grabs another melon from the rack.)

ABU: Goodbye!

(He gets up. The OWNER brings the melon to the front,
    where he places it on top of a pile. He looks confused, like
    he just did that.)

ALADDIN: Well done, Abu. Breakfast is served.

(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof open the melon and eat. We see J
    ASMINE walking in the street.)

MERCHANT 1: Pretty lady, buy a pot. There is no finer brass pot
            or money.
MERCHANT 2: Sweet dates, sweet dates and figs! Sugar
            dates and pistachios!
MERCHANT 3: Would the lady like a necklace? A pretty
            necklace for a pretty lady.

(She is charmed by the action, but is surprised by a fish strike
    in his face.)

MERCHANT 4: Fresh fish! We catch them, you buy them!
JASMINE: I don't think so. (She steps back but runs into
        a fire eater, who is surprised to swallow his
        fire.) Oh, excuse me. (He swallows, then burps
        fire comes out of his mouth. JASMINE is disgusted. He is
        happy and pats his stomach. ALADDIN sees her,
        and a strange look appears on his face.) I am
        really very sorry.
ALADDIN: (He is obviously deeply in love with her.) Wow!

(She pulls the hood of her coat over her head. ABU sees this and
    jumps on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN's
    confront.)

ABU: Uh oh. Good morning? Good morning?

(JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child.
    look for a piece of fruit. She takes one and gives it to
    him.)

JASMINE: Oh, you must be hungry. Here is. (THE
            the boy runs away.)
OWNER: You better be able to pay for it.
JASMINE: (Mystified) Pay?
OWNER: No one steals my basket!
JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I have no money.
OWNER: Thief!
JASMINE: Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can
            get some from the sultan.
OWNER: Do you know what the penalty is in the event of theft?

(He takes her hand and fixes it on the table, with the intention of
    cut it.)

JASMINE: No, no, please!

(The sword falls, but his hand is stopped by that of ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Thank you, kind sir. I'm so glad you found
            her. I looked for you everywhere.
JASMINE: (whispering) What are you doing?
ALADDIN: (whispering back) Play along.
OWNER: Do you know this girl?
JASMINE: Unfortunately, yes. She is my sister. She is a little
            mad. (He puts his finger around his ear.
            She is shocked. The OWNER catches it by
            vest.)
OWNER: She said she knew the sultan!
ALADDIN: She thinks the monkey is the sultan.

(ABU picks his pockets. He hears this, then stands up.
    JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.)

JASMINE: Oh, wise Sultan. How can I serve you?
ABU: Well, blah blah blah blah.
ALADDIN: Tragic, isn't it? (He leans forward and chooses
            take another apple from the cart with its
            foot.) But, no harm was done. (He walks towards
            Jasmine.) Now come sister. It's time to see the
            doctor.
JASMINE: (to a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor.
            How are you doing?
ALADDIN: No, no, no. Not this one. (To ABU, including
            the pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan.

(ABU bows to the crowd and everything he stole from the cart falls
    out.)

OWNER: Huh? What is this? (ABU picks up what he can
            carry, and the trio flees.) Come back here,
            you little thieves!

(Cut to inside the JAFAR laboratory. IAGO is spinning on a gear in a weird state.
    gadget. At the top of the craft is a brewing storm.)

IAGO: (huffing and puffing) With all due respect, your
        rot, couldn't we wait for a real storm?
JAFAR: Hold your breath, Iago. Faster! (He places the
        The SULTAN's ring in the craft.)
IAGO: Yes, O mighty evil one.

(IAGO runs faster. Lightning crosses the ring, passing in front
    in an hourglass below. The sands begin to swirl.)

JAFAR: Ah, the sands of time, reveal to me the one who can
        enter the cave. (The sand at the top forms the Cave of
        Wonders. He falls into a storm, but he
        shows ALADDIN climbing a ladder, followed by
        JASMINE who is covered in her coat.) Yes, yes!
        Here it is. My diamond in the rough!
IAGO: Is that him?!?! It's the clown we've been
        you wait ? (IAGO loses his footing and gets sucked
        in the gears.)
JAFAR: Let the guards send him an invitation to
        the palace, okay?

(IAGO walks past and hits the wall upside down.)

IAGO: Great.

(JAFAR laughs horribly, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with
    ALADDIN inside. Finally we dissolve into the true escalation of ALADDIN
    at the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.)

ALADDIN: I'm almost there.

(JASMINE climbs over, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms.
    She gets up.)

JASMINE: I want to thank you for arresting this man.
ALADDIN: Uh, forget it. (He grabs a pole.) So, uh, it's
        your first time on the market, huh?

(ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE: Is it so obvious?
ALADDIN: Well, you stand out rather well. (He looks at her,
        still in love. She returns the look. But he
        realizes what he's doing and returns to normal.)
        I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous it is
        Agrabah can be. (He places a board between the
        buildings she can walk on, but as it leans
        at the bottom, she jumps above his head. He looks back
        surprise. She throws the stick at him. Both
        ALADDIN and ABU's eyes are bulging.)
JASMINE: I learn quickly.
ALADDIN: It's true. Come on, this way. (They enter the roof
        of a building, avoiding boards and beams as they
        come on.) Whoa. Watch your head there. Be careful.
JASMINE: Is this where you live?
ALADDIN: Yes. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.
JASMINE: Fabulous.
ALADDIN: Well, it's not much, (he draws the curtain and
        exposes the palace) but it offers a magnificent view.
        Palace looks really amazing, huh?
JASMINE: Oh, that's wonderful.
ALADDIN: I wonder what it would be like to live there, to
        have servants and valets...
JASMINE: Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how
        get dressed.
ALADDIN: It's better than here. Always looking for food
        and dodge the guards.
JASMINE: You are not free to make your own choices.
ALADDIN: Sometimes you feel so...
JASMINE: You're just...
BOTH: (in unison) – trapped.

(They look at each other, realizing that they are perfect for each other
    another. But ALADDIN then realizes where he is and breaks the
    look. He takes the apple from ABU's hand and rolls it in his
    arm in JASMINE's hand.)

ALADDIN: So where are you from?
JASMINE: What does it matter? I ran away and I'm not
        return.
ALADDIN: Really? (He bites into the apple in his
        hand, then hands it to ABU, who looks disgusted
        look at his face.)
ABU: Why you!

(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE.)

JASMINE: My father is forcing me to get married.
ALADDIN: It's--it's horrible. (ABU appears behind the
        princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!

(ABU runs to a higher point, chattering and swearing as he goes.)

JASMIN: What?
ALADDIN: Abu says... uh... it's not fair.
ABU: What?
JASMINE: Oh, right?
ALADDIN: Yeah, sure.
JASMINE: And does Abu have anything else to say?
ALADDIN: Well, uh, he wishes he could do something
        help.
ABU: Oh, boy!
JASMINE: Hmm, tell him that's very nice.

(ALADDIN and JASMINE get closer and closer, until
    ALADDIN leans over to kiss her. However, it is interrupted
    by the GUARDS, who found them.)

GUARD: There you are!
ALADDIN and JASMINE: They found me! (to each other) They are
                After you?
JASMINE: My father must have sent them...
ALADDIN: Do you trust me?
JASMIN: What?
ALADDIN: Do you trust me? (He holds out his hand)
JASMIN: Yes. (She takes it.)
ALADDIN: Then jump!

(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt. They
    try to escape, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)

GUARD: We keep crossing paths, don't we,
        street rat?

(Again, the GUARD'S turban is shot by ABU, but other guards are
    here and block the exit. The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and
     throws it into a vase. Three more GUARDS catch ALADDIN.)

GUARD: This is the dungeon for you, boy.
ALADDIN: Hey, let me go!
JASMINE: Let him go.
GUARD: (Not realizing she's the princess) Look what we
        have here, men, a street mouse. (He throws it away
        down.)
JASMINE: (getting up and removing the hood of her cloak)
        Let him go, on the princess's orders.

(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.)

GUARD: Princess Jasmine.
ALADDIN: The princess?
ABU: (looking from the vase) The princess?
GUARD: What are you doing outside the palace? And with
        this street rat?
JASMINE: It's not your problem. Do as I command. Release
        him!
GUARD: Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from
        Jafar. You will need to discuss this with him.

(The GUARDS drag ALADDIN outside, bowing.)

JASMINE: (having a very angry look) Believe me, I
        will.

(Cut to inside the palace, JAFAR coming out of his secret apartments. He
    carefully slides the door, but the princess comes rushing in
    before he finished. He closes it, trapping IAGO inside.
    the door frame.)

JASMINE: Jafar?
JAFAR: Oh, uh, princess.
IAGO: Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck!
JAFAR: How can I be of help to you? (He spreads his
        cape, hiding the door.)
JASMINE: The guards just took a boy from the market, on your
        orders.
JAFAR: Your father charged me with maintaining peace in
        Agrabah. The boy was a criminal.
JASMINE: What was the crime?
IAGO: I can't breathe, Jafar!
JAFAR: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.
IAGO: If you could just... (JAFAR pushes him back inside the
        door and it slams) - wow, that hurts!
JASMINE: He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!
JAFAR: (walking away as if shocked) Oh, my God! Oh why
        terribly upsetting. If I had known.
JASMINE: What do you mean?
JAFAR: Unfortunately, the boy's sentence has already been carried out
        out.
JASMINE: What sentence?
JAFAR: (in a sinister tone) Death. (JASMINE gasps.)
        By decapitating.
JASMIN: No! (She collapses to the ground.)
JAFAR: I am extremely sorry, princess.
JASMINE: How could you? (She runs out of the room crying.)

(IAGO finally manages to get through the door. He flies away and lands on
    JAFAR's shoulder, coughing.)

IAGO: So how did it go?
JAFAR: I think she took it pretty well. (They both receive a
        sinister smile on their faces.)

(Diss. to JASMINE at night, crying by the fountain. RAJAH
    comes to comfort her. She caresses him.)

JASMINE: It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't even know his
        name.

(Cut to inside the dungeon. The rats rush out and we go down until we see
    ALADDIN chained to the wall.)

ALADDIN: (to himself) She was the princess. I do not believe
        he. I must have seemed so stupid to him.
ABU: (from a distance) Yoo-hoo! Aladdin? Good morning!

(ABU appears at the window at the top of the dungeon.)

ALADDIN: Abu! Here! Hey, come on, help me out of this.

(ABU stops, then starts chattering wildly, falling to the ground. He
     wraps a cloth around his head and makes big eyes at him
     imitation of the princess.)

ALADDIN: Hey, she was in trouble. Ah, she was worth it.

(ABU jumps onto ALADDIN's shoulders and pulls out a small set of tools
    from his pocket, then releases ALADDIN.)

ABU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
ALADDIN: Don't worry, Abou. I will never see her again. I am a
        street rat, remember, and there is a law. She is
        I must marry a prince, she deserves it.

(ABU finally releases ALADDIN's hands.)

ABU: Ta da!
ALADDIN: (rubbing his wrists) I'm a–I'm a fool
OLD MAN: You're just a fool if you give up, boy.

(We see an OLD MAN sitting in a corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU
    I already saw.)

ALADDIN: Who are you?
THE OLD MAN: A humble prisoner, like you. But together,
        maybe we can be more.
ALADDIN: I'm listening.
OLD MAN: There's a cave, boy. A cave of wonders. Completed
        with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
        Enough treasure to impress even your princess, I would
        bet.

(Listeners will notice that the OLD MAN said the word
    'princess' as "prin-CESS" rather than the standard pronunciation
     from “PRIN-cess.” The OLD MAN turns his back and IAGO stays
    his head sticking out of JAFAR's "old man" disguise.)

IAGO: Jafar, can you hurry up? I'm dying here!
ALADDIN: But the law says that only a prince can marry...
OLD MAN: You've heard of the Golden Rule, haven't you, boy?
        Whoever has the gold makes the rules. (He smiles,
        showing a horribly bad mouth.)
ALADDIN: Then why would you share all this wonderful
        a treasure with me?
OLD MAN: I need a young man with strong legs and a strong
        I'll come back to go there later.
ALADDIN: Ah, a problem. It's outside, are we here?

(The OLD MAN walks towards a wall and pushes a hidden exit.)

THE OLD MAN: Mmm, mmm, mmm. Things are not always what they are.
        seem. So, do we have a deal?

(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs his shoulders.)

ABU: Oh, um.

(Cut to a desert scene. We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the
    OLD MAN and ABU on it. Insult. at the Cave of Wonders.)

CAVE: Who disturbs my sleep?
ALADDIN: It's me, Aladdin.
CAVE: Continue. Do not touch anything except the lamp.

(The cave opens with a roar, and a staircase appears in front
    ALADDIN. )

OLD MAN: Remember, my boy, go get me the lamp first, and then
        you will have your reward.
ALADDIN: Come on, Abu. (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of
        his vest.)

(ALADDIN begins to descend the stairs. He reaches the bottom
    and enters a golden chamber filled with treasures.)

ALADDIN: Would you like to look at that!
ABU: Uh oh!
ALADDIN: Just a handful of these things would make me richer
        than the sultan!

(ABU takes a look, sees the treasure, then rushes towards it.)

ALADDIN: Abu!

(ABU stops mid-run, hovering over a mat on the floor.)

ALADDIN: Don’t touch anything! We need to find this lamp.

(They begin to make their way across the room when the CARPET rises
    from the ground and begins to follow them. ABU has the feeling
    they are followed.)

ABU: Huh?

(He turns around and the CARPET lies flat on the ground. He continues and
    the CARPET starts to follow again. Once again, ABU turns around, but the
     CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasures. HAS DRUNK
     runs towards ALADDIN and pulls his pant leg.)

ABU: Aladdin! Aladdin!
ALADDIN: Abu, will you stop him?

(Again the MAT follows, but this time, when ABU turns around, the MAT
    jump to the other side. He goes down with a pompom and pulls
    ABU's tail. When ABU jumps, CARPET goes towards the other again
     side. This time ABU lands in a karate stance. CARPET reached
    lies down and takes off ABU's hat, then puts it on himself. ABU is sitting
    thinking for a second, until CARPET waved an acorn in front of his
     confront. ABU and CARPET both jump in fright and run away. The ABU attacks
     ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)

ALADDIN: Abu, what are you... crazy?

(The CARPET appears behind a pile of treasures.)

ALADDIN: A magic carpet! Let's go. Get out. I'm not going to
        hurt you.

(Carpet comes out slowly, timidly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts
    it goes out. He flies towards ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to him.
     him. ABU screams and jumps on ALADDIN's shoulder.)

ALADDIN: Calm down, Abu. He's not going to bite.

(The CARPET takes ABU's hat again and hands it to him. ABU shakes
    his fist and shouts at it. CARPET starts to move away, "unfortunately.")

ALADDIN: Hey, wait a minute. Do not go. Maybe you can help
        We. (CARPET looks back, excited. He then flies away
        and wraps itself around the pair.) Hey, whoa! You
        you see, we are trying to find this lamp. (CARPET
        gestures for them to follow him.) I think he knows
        where is it.

(They pass through a long cave, until emerging in a giant
    underground cavern. In the center of the room is a large pillar,
     with a staircase leading up to it. It is surrounded by water
     with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge. At the top of
    the pillar is a beam of light. ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)

ALADDIN: Wait here!
ABU: Oh. Eh?

(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey. The outstretched paws hold a
    giant ruby. ABU is hypnotically drawn there. ALADDIN climbs the
     stairs quickly. CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain
     to hold him. ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN: Is that it? This is what we've come all the way to
        here for-- (He looks down and sees ABU freeing himself
        from taking CARPET and rushes towards the jewel.) Abu-
        NO!

(ABU grabs the jewel. There is a rumble and the room begins to collapse.)
    shake.)

VOICES FROM THE CAVES: Infidels!
ABU: Uh oh!
VOICE FROM THE CAVE: You have touched the forbidden treasure. (HAS DRUNK
               puts the jewel back in the paw, but the jewel
                and the sanctuary melts into lava.) Now you
                will never see the light of day again!

(ALADDIN runs down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he
    descends towards the sky until it flies into the air. The water turned into
     wash. He falls towards her, when suddenly TAPIS appears
    and catches him. ABU stands on one of the rocks of the
    bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava.
    Then CARPET rushes and ALADDIN catches him, just as the last rock
     explodes.)

ALADDIN: Wow! Mats, let's move!

(Together they run through the caves avoiding walls and falling.
    debris. ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.)

ALADDIN: Abu, now is not the time to panic! (He withdraws ABU
        his head and sees that they are flying against a wall.)
        Start panicking.

(CARPET goes into a dive, then goes through another cave. Eventually, they
    emerge through the interior entrance. Outside, the cave begins to
     growl and shut down. CARPET and company are almost at the top when a
    a rock falls on a carpet and sends it to the ground. ALADDIN catches
    on the rock wall and holds on. He sees the OLD MAN at the top,
    at hand.)

ALADDIN: Help me!
OLD MAN: Throw me the lamp!
ALADDIN: I can't hold on. Give me your hand.
OLD MAN: Give me the lamp first!

(ALADDIN reaches out and takes out the MAGIC LAMP. He holds it out, a
    and the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)

OLD MAN: Ha ha ha ha! Yes! Finally! Ha ha ha ha!

(ALADDIN came out with the help of ABU. But OLD
     The MAN pushes ABU away and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.)

ALADDIN: What are you doing?
OLD MAN: I'll give you your reward. (JAFAR returns to his
        normal voice.) Your eternal reward.

(He takes out a twisted dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when
    ABU bites him on the wrist. He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN,
     who falls into the cave. THE OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave while
     GOOD. They fall. CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a
     rock. He struggles to free himself, then he does. It's racing
     and catches up with ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several times
    times, and is unconscious. On the surface, the cave roars
    last time, then falls back into the sand. JAFAR succeeds
     his disguise.)

JAFAR: Hey hey hey! It's mine. It's all mine! I (he can't
        find it in his pocket) --- where is it? No no!!

(The kiss disappears into JASMINE's room. She is sitting on her bed, next to
    to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN enters.)

SULTAN: Jasmine? Oh my dear. What's wrong?
JASMINE: Jafar...did...something...terrible. (She
        She looks like she's crying.)
SULTAN: There, there, there, my child, we will make things right.
        Now tell me everything.

(Cut to inside the cave. ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET.
    ABU tries to wake him up.)

ABU: Oh, oh. Aladdin? Wake up. Aladdin.

(TAPIT gets up, lifting ALADDIN. He wakes up slowly.)

ALADDIN: Oh, my head. (He looks at the sealed entrance.)
        Were trapped. (Angry, clenching his fists towards the
        entry) This two-faced son of a jackal! (Calmer)
        Whoever it was, he's long gone with that lamp.
ABU: Aha!

(ABU takes out the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN: Well, you little hairy thief! It looks like such
        a dilapidated, worthless piece of junk. Hey, I think
        there is something written here, but it's hard to understand
        kiss.

(He rubs the LAMP. Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the
    The LAMP begins to shake and shine, but ALADDIN clings to the light.
    LAMP, and our wonderful friend, the GENIUS comes out.)

GENIE: Aaaaahhhhh! Oi! Ten thousand years will give you
        what a pain in the neck! (He hangs ALADDIN on a
        rock nearby. Then he tears off his head and turns
        around, shouting while he does it. CARPET pulls a
        ALADDIN below.) Whoa! Does it feel good to be
        get out of there ! (GENIE uses the tip of his lamp as
        a microphone.) Glad to be back, ladies and
        Gentlemen. Hi, where are you from? (He puts the microphone in
        (ALADDIN's face.) What is your name?
ALADDIN: Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.
GENIUS: (Pronounces his name as if he had discovered something
        middle finger) Aladdin! (A neon sign lights up with
        ALADDIN's name on it, surrounded by tracking lights. THE
        signs the changes to reflect the next line of the GENIE.)
        Hello Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Can
        we call you “Al?” » Or maybe just “Din?” " Or how
        about “Laddi?” » (GENIE disappears, then a dog
        wrapped in plaid jumps in.) It looks like “Here, boy!
        Come on, Laddi!
ALADDIN: (shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder.
        that I thought.
GENIE: (Still a dog) Do you smoke? Do you mind if I do? (Dog
        poof in smoke, then back to the GENIE. HAS DRUNK
        screams wildly.) Oh, sorry Cheetah, I hope I
        I didn't burn the fur! Hey, Rugman! I have not seen
        you in a few millennia! Give me a pompom! Yo!
        Yeah! (THE CARPET flies over and greets the GENIUS.
        GENIUS looks at ALADDIN.) Say, you are much smaller
        as my last master. (He raises his beer belly.) Either
        That or I get bigger. Look at me from the
        aside, am I different from you?
ALADDIN: Wait a minute! I am... your master?
GENIUS: (He puts a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a
        mortar on the head.) It's true! he can
        be taught!! What would you like from me, (like Arnold
        Schwarzenegger) the always impressive, (inside a
        cube) the long content, (like a ventriloquist with
        a mannequin) often imitated, (throws the mannequin aside)
        but never duplicated...

(He multiplies into multiple GENIES that surround him.)

DUP. GENIES: Duplicated, duplicated, duplicated,
            duplicated, duplicated, duplicated,
            duplicated, duplicated, duplicated.
GENIUS: (He says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.)
        Genius! Of! The lamp! (He enters Ed
        Sullivan) Right here, straight from the lamp, that's right
        here for your greatest pleasure, the fulfillment of your wishes.
        Thank youuuuu!
ALADDIN: Wow! Wish fulfillment?
GENIUS: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-no on the
        wishing more wishes. (Turns into a lunge
        machine, the arm lowers and three GENIES appear in
        the windows.) There you go, three. (Three GENIUS
        the caballeros come out of the slot.) Uno, dos, tres.
        (Change to b/w Groucho Marx.) No
        substitutions, exchanges or refunds. (Duck
        falls with the secret word “Refunds”.
ALADDIN: (TO ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming.
GENIE: (The music from "Friend Like Me" begins) Master, I don't know
        I think you realize what you have here! SO
        why don't you ruminate while I shine
        the possibilities. (GENIE lights up like a
        fluorescent light)

    Well, Ali Baba had forty thieves
    Scheherazadie had a thousand stories
    But control yourself with luck because you have your work cut out for you
    You have a brand of magic that never fails!

(GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords.
    GENIUS appears in his vest, then takes out his arms and is a hit
    thieves to submit.)

    You have power in your corner now
    Some heavy ammunition in your camp
    You got punch, spice, Yahoo and how
    See, all you have to do is rub this lamp
    And I will say

(The boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, getting a massage.
    by GENIUS. Then the GENIE turns into a bunch of fireworks and
    explodes. Then GENIUS appears inside the lamp and grabs ALADDIN's lamp.
     hand and rub the lamp with it.)

    Mister Aladdin sir
    What will be your pleasure?
    Let me take your order, write it down
    You never had a friend like me
    No no no!

(GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes things on a
    notepad, like a server. )

    Life is your restaurant
    And I am your master!
    Come on, whisper what you want
    You've never had a friend like me.

(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal,
    but widens his ear to listen to ALADDIN. Finally it explodes
     in four GENIE in duplicate.)

    Yes sir, we pride ourselves on our service
    You are the boss, the king, the shah!
    Say what you want, it's yours! Real dish
    How about some more Baklava?

(The GENIES give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN
    appears in a comfortable armchair (eh?) surrounded by the treasure
    and being stirred up by women. The GENIUS appears and fills the
    screen with baklava.)

    Try a bit of column “A”
    Try the whole column “B”
    I'm in the mood to help you man
    You never had a friend like me

(ALADDIN rises on a column of food with a giant A at the top,
    then move to another column with a B at the top. He falls
    and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE. He opens his mouth,
    and his tongue turns into a staircase. A miniature GENIUS
     dressed like a spell magician.)

(The mini GENIE does a little dance with the two GENIE giants
    hands. At the end, they surround the mini GENIUS and crush
    it in nothing.)

    Can your friends do this?
    Do your friends do this?
    Do your friends pull this out of their little hat?
    Can your friends go poof!
    Well look here
    Can your friends go Abracadabra, let them rip
    And then make this bastard disappear?

(The GENIUS tears off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them.
    He throws them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins
    one of the heads on the tip of his finger like a basketball. He throws
     heads return to the GENIE, who tries to shoot
     itself pulled out of a hat at its base. It goes around and around and around
     until he turns into a white rabbit. The rabbit turns into
    a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center).
     The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS,
    who dance around ALADDIN. The moment he begins to appreciate them,
     They disappear.)

    So don't just sit there, slack-jawed, blank-eyed
    I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
    You got me in good faith, certified
    Do you have a genius in charge? business!
    I have a strong desire to help you
    So what you want, I really want to know
    You have a wish that's three miles long, without a doubt
    So all you have to do is rub like this, and oh!


(GENIE imitates what he calls ALADDIN, then transforms into
    certificate that rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN. GENIUS shoots
     a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses
    rubbing your buttocks as if to dry yourself after a shower.)

    Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three
    I'm at work, big mogul
    You never had a friend, you never had a friend
    You never had a friend, you never had a friend
    You've never... had a... friend... like... me!
    You've never had a friend like me!

(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans over to kiss one.
     She transforms into a GENIUS, who zaps four dancing elephants by
    existence. In the other direction, he skips four dancing camels,
     and a big final dance number follows. ABU recovers so much gold
     as he can, but the GENIUS packs everything into a cyclone and
    zaps him until they are all back in the cave. GENIUS has a
    neon “APPLAUSES” sign on his back. ABU turns his hat and
    sees that it is empty.)

GENIE: So what's it going to be, master?
ALADDIN: Are you going to grant me the three wishes I want?
GENIE: (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost. There is a
        some reservations, some considerations
ALADDIN: Like?
GENIE: Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anyone. (He
        cuts off his head with his finger.) So don't do it
        ask. Second rule: I can't make anyone fall in love
        with someone else. (The head turns into a large pair of
        lips kissing ALADDIN.) You little punim, there.
        (Lies flat, then stands up and transforms into
        zombie.) Third rule: I can't bring people back from
        the dead. It's not a pretty picture, (He catches
        ALADDIN and shakes him) I don't like doing that! (He
        poofs returns to normal.) Other than that, you have
        he!
ALADDIN: (looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, reservations? You
        mean limitations? On wishes? (To ABU) Some all
        powerful genius - can't even bring people back from
        the dead. I don't know, Abu - he probably can't even
        get us out of this cave. It looks like we're going
        I have to find a way out of here...

(They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps in front
    them.)

GENIE: Excuse me? Are you watching
        Me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up, did you
        are you bringing me here? And all of a sudden you are
        are you letting me down? (Becomes angrier and angrier) I
        I don't think so, not now. You have your
        wishes, then sit down! (They all get on CARPET.
        GENIE takes the form of a flight attendant, with lots of
        arm indicating the exits.) In case of
        Emergency, the exits are here, here, here,
        here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here,
        here, anywhere! Keep your hands and arms inside
        the carpet. Weeee'rrrrrreee... out of here!

(The CARPET and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and fly away
    far away. Cut to int. from the SULTAN's room. JAFAR is
    there with IAGO, JASMINE and the SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Jafar, this is a scandal. If it wasn't for everything
        your years of good and loyal service... . From now on,
        you must discuss with me the sentencing of prisoners,
        before they were decapitated.
JAFAR: I assure you, Your Highness, this will not happen again.
SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, now let's mess this up
        business behind us. Please?
JAFAR: My most abject and humble apologies
        well, princess. (He takes her hand to kiss it, but
        she tears it off.)
JASMINE: At least there will be some good if I have to
        marry. When I am queen, I will have the
        power to get rid of you.
SULTAN: That's nice. So everything was settled. Now, Jasmine,
        return to this suitor affair, (he
        looks and sees Jasmine coming out) Jasmine?
        Jasmine! (He runs after her.)
JAFAR: If only I had that lamp!
IAGO: (as JASMINE) I will have the power to get rid of
        You! Oh! Thinking - we must continue to kiss each other
        until this idiot, and his idiot daughter for the
        the rest of our lives...
JAFAR: No, Iago. Only until she finds an idiot husband.
        Then she will have us banished... or beheaded!
BOTH: Eeewww!
IAGO: (has an idea) Oh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
        Jafar? What if you were the idiot husband?
JAFAR: (He looks at IAGO insultingly) What?
IAGO: Okay, you marry the princess, okay? So, uh,
        you become sultan!
JAFAR: Oh! Marry the shrew? I become sultan. The idea has
        deserved!
IAGO: Yes, deserve it! Yes! And then we let stepfather down and
        the little woman on the edge of a cliff! (Plunge the bombs into the
        floor) Kersplat!
JAFAR: Iago, I love the way your dirty little mind works!

(Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where CARPET is
    arriving for a landing.)

GENIE: (Still as flight attendant) Thank you for choosing Magic
        Mats for all your travel needs. Don't stand
        until the belt has completely stopped. (As
        ALADDIN and ABU descend the staircase formed by
        CARPET) Thank you. Goodbye goodbye! THANKS!
        Bye! (Back to normal) Well, now. What would you say
        That, sir, do you doubt Mustafa?
ALADDIN: Oh, you showed me that well. Now about my three wishes-
GENIUS: Are my ears deceiving me? Three? You are down
        A boy!
ALADDIN: Ah, no, I never really wanted to leave the
        cave. You did it alone.

(GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops. He transforms into
    sheep.)

GENIE: Well, don't I just feel sheepish? Well done you
        baaaaad my boy, but no more presents.
ALADDIN: Fair deal. So three wishes. I want them to be
        GOOD. (TO GENIE) What do you want?

(GENIE hangs like a hammock between two trees.)

GENIE: Me? No one has ever asked me that before. Well, in
        my case, ah, forget it.
ALADDIN: What? No tell me.
GENIUS: Freedom.
ALADDIN: Are you a prisoner?
GENIUS: It's all an integral part, the whole concert of genius.
        (Becomes gigantic, the voice resonates) Phenomenal cosmic
        powers! (Shrinks, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.)
        A very small living space
ALADDIN: Genius, it's terrible.
GENIE: (Exits the LAMP) But, oh... to be free. Not
        I have to say "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?
        you need? Poof! What do you need?" To be mine
        master, such a thing would be greater than all
        magic and all the treasures from around the world! But
        what am I talking about here? Let's be realistic
        here. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. Genius, wake up and
        you smell like hummus
ALADDIN: Why not?
GENIUS: The only way I can get out of this is if my master
        wish I would go out. So you can guess how often it is
        arrived.
ALADDIN: I will. I will free you.
GENIE: (Head transforms into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Um
        eh, it's true. Shout!
ALADDIN: No, really, I promise. (He tucks his nose in
        and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After doing my
        first two wishes, I will use my third wish to define you
        free. (He holds out his hand)
GENIE: Well, I hope so. (He shakes ALADDIN's hand.)
        OK Let's make magic! (Turns into
        magician.) So what about it. what do you want
        most of them?
ALADDIN: Well, there's this girl...
GENIUS: Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and the GENIUS' chest shows a
        heart with a cross through it.) Wrong! I can't
        make anyone fall in love, remember?
ALADDIN: Oh, but Genie. She's smart and fun and...
GENIUS: Pretty?
ALADDIN: Magnificent. She has these eyes that... and
        that hair, wow...and her smile.
GENIUS: (Sitting in a Parisian café with ABU and CARPET.)
        Am I. It's love.
ALADDIN: But she's the princess. To even have a chance, I
        I have to be a... hey, can you make me a prince?
GENIE: Let's see here. (Has a "Royal Cookbook.") Um,
        Royal chicken? (Out comes a chicken with a
        crown on the head) No. Alaskan king crab?
        (He tears off his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab
        "The Little Mermaid" stuck.) Ouch, I
        I hate it when they do that. Caesar salad? (A
        (a dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) And you,
        Bully? Ah, to make a prince. (He looks slyly
        ALADDIN.) Is this now an official wish? Say it
        words!
ALADDIN: Genie, I wish you would make me a prince!
GENIE: Very good! Woof woof woof woof! (Take the square
        shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. then becomes
        a tailor/fashion designer.) First, this fez and
        The vest combo is way too third century. These
        patches - what are we trying to say - beggar? No!
        Let's work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN's
        measures, snap your fingers and ALADDIN is
        dressed in his prince costume.) I like it, muy
        macho! Now I still need something. What does it do
        Tell me? It's about mode of transportation. Excuse
        me, monkey boy! Aqui, this way! (ABU tries to
        covers himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and
        he flies over.)
ABU: Uh oh!
GENIE: Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are playing
        show setting, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with
        "AL" on it.) And what better way to make your
        grand entrance into the streets of Agrabah, which
        Ride your own brand new camel! Attention,
        it spits! (A door with the GENIUS' head on it
        opens, where ABU transforms into a camel. He
        spits out the side of his mouth on cue. But the
        GENIE isn't sure.) Mmm, not enough. (He slams his
        fingers and ABU transforms into a fancy white horse.)
        It's still not enough. Let's see. What do you need?
        (The GENIUS snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning
        ABU in: a duck, an ostrich, a turtle and a '57
        Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1". (It's this one
        I guess, I don't know cars, but judging by the tail
        fins, said nuff.) Finally, he returned to
        normal.) Yes!! Esalalumbo, Shimin Dumbo! Wow!!
        (And on the key word of the spell, Dumbo, ABU transforms
        as an elephant. CARPET is struggling to get by
        under ABU size 46 feet.) Talk about your trunk
        space, watch this action!

(ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree.
     The tree naturally bends down to the ground, where ABU
     hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.)

ALADDIN: Abu, you look good.
GENIUS: He has the outfit, he has the elephant, but
        we are not finished yet. Hold on to your turban,
        kid, because we're going to make you a star!

(We slowly zoom out with the oasis in the distance, like fireworks
    start to explode outwards. Shot to CU of pile of toys.
    (Look for the BEAST here.) We bow and see the SULTAN
    balance them. He carefully balances the last piece on top,
     then sits and sighs. JAFAR bursts in, however, and the
    the pile collapses.)

JAFAR: Sire, I found a solution to the problem with
        your daughter.
IAGO: Awk! The problem with your daughter!
SULTAN: Oh, really?
JAFAR: (unrolling a scroll) Right here. "If the princess
        did not choose a husband at the appointed time,
        then the sultan will choose for her.
SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all these suitors! (He tries to
        put a cracker in IAGO's mouth. IAGO supports
        far. The SULTAN distractedly pulls the cracker
        back.) How could I choose someone she hates?
        (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a
        a cracker in your mouth.)
JAFAR: Do not worry, my lord. There is more. If, in the
        case where a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess
        then you have to marry... hmm... interesting.
SULTAN: What? WHO?
JAFAR: The royal vizier! Well, that would be... me!
SULTAN: Well, I thought the law said only a prince can
        marry a princess, I'm sure of it.
JAFAR: Desperate times call for desperate measures, my
        lord. (He takes out the stick and hypnotizes him
        SULTAN with that.)
SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...
JAFAR: You will order the princess to marry me.
SULTAN: I... will... order... the princess... to... (the spell
        breaks momentarily)...but you're so old!
JAFAR: (holds the stick closer) The princess is getting married
        Me!
SULTAN: The princess will marry... (the fate is again
        broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of "Prince
        Ali".) What? What is it? This music! Ha ha ha.
        Jafar., you have to come see this!

(We see a parade moving forward, led by what appears to be the GENIUS in
    human form as MAJOR.)

WALKERS: Make way for Prince Ali!
SWORDSMEN: Say hello! It's Prince Ali!
MAJOR: Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar,
    Hey you, let us pass, it's a bright new star,
    Now come on, be the first in your neighborhood to catch his eye!
    Make way, here it is,
    Ring the bells, strike the drums.
    You will love this guy

(The MAJOR mixes with the different members of the crowd.)

    Prince Ali, fabulous him, Ali Ababwa!
    Genuflect, show some respect
    On your knees

(ABU the elephant crosses the city, with ALADDIN (ALI) on its back.)

    Now do your best to stay calm
    Improve your Sunday Salaam
    And come meet his spectacular coterie.

(IAGO dances to the music until JAFAR looks at him. The
    MAJOR "wheelbarrows" place six men on ABU's trunk. They stand
    on each other's shoulders while ALI shakes hands.)

    Prince Ali, mighty be he, Ali Ababwa!
    Strong as ten ordinary men, definitely
    He galloped against the hordes
    A hundred bad guys with swords
    Who sent these morons to their lords, why Prince Ali!

(The pile collapses on ALI, but a flash of GENIE(tm) brand
    zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all in an acrobatic movement
     wheel formation. The GENIUS transforms into an old man, then into a child
    and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.)

MEN'S CHORUS: (Carrying the camels) He has seventy-five golden camels!

(In pops, a typical parade commentator)

HARRY: Aren't they lovely, June?

WOMEN'S CHORUS: (On a float) Purple peacocks, there are fifty-three of them!

(Another commentator arrives.)

JUNE: Fabulous, Harry, I love feathers!

GENIE: (GENIE is off-screen, a giant balloon gorilla comes down
            the parade)
    When it comes to exotic type mammals
    Does he have a zoo, I tell you
    This is a world-class menagerie!

(GENIE appears as a leopard, then a goat, and pronounces the last two
    lines to the two children from earlier. We move to a balcony,
    where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.)

    GENIUS:
        GIRLS: (in counterpoint)
    Prince Ali, he is handsome, Ali Ababwa
        There is no doubt that Ali is attractive
    This physique, how can I speak
        Never ordinary, never boring
    Weak knee
        Everything about this man simply impresses
    Well come out to this place
        He's a marvel, he's a genius, a marvel
    Adjust your sail and get ready
        He's about to break my heart
    Gawk, crawl and stare at Prince Ali!
        And I love the way he dresses!

(JASMINE watches from the palace balcony. She
    he leaves, then leaves.)

CHORUS: He has ninety-five white Persian monkeys!
    (He has the monkeys, let's see the monkeys!)
    And to view them, it doesn't charge any fees!
    (He is generous, so generous)
    He has slaves, he has servants and minions!
    (Proud to work for him)
    They bow to his whims, love to serve him
    They just suck when it comes to loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!

(ALADDIN throws gold coins to the people who rush towards
    Collect them. ABU and the parade ascend the steps of the
    palace and interior. The SULTAN runs back to the door
    towards the throne room, but JAFAR is standing in front of the door.
    Suddenly it opens up, with ABU leading and overwhelming
     JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)

GENIUS: Prince Ali!
    In love with him! Ali Ababwa
    I hear your princess is a lovely sight to behold!
    And that is why, good people,
    He got dressed and went
    With sixty elephants, llamas galore
    With its bears and its lions
    A marching band and more
    With its forty fakirs, its cooks, its bakers
    His birds chirping on the sidelines
    Make way for Prince Ali!

(More and more fanfare builds up until ALADDIN flies away on ABU's back.
    on MAGIC CARPET and flies towards the SULTAN. JAFAR denounces
     closed door.)

SULTAN: (clapping) Splendid, absolutely wonderful.
ALADDIN: (takes a deeper voice.) Ahem. Your majesty, I have
            I have come from far away to seek your daughter's hand.
SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa! Of course. I am pleased to
        meet you. (He rushes and shakes ALI's hand.)
        This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He is delighted
        Also.
JAFAR: (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic. I'm scared, Prince
        Aboubou--
ALADDIN: --Ababwa!
JAFAR: It doesn't matter. You can't just scroll here without being prompted
        and I expect...
SULTAN: ...by Allah, this is a truly remarkable device.
        (He pulls on the pom poms, and they pull on his
        mustache.) I don't think I could...
ALADDIN: Well, certainly, your majesty. Allow me.

(He helps the SULTAN onto the CARPET, and he drops down.
    JAFAR pins the MAT to the ground with the stick.)

JAFAR: Sire, I must advise you against that...
SULTAN: --Oh, button up, Jafar. Learn to have a little fun.

(He kicks the stick and CARPET and SULTAN fly away. IAGO, who
    stood on the head of the stick, falls repeatedly
     hitting the stick with its beak as it descends. SULTAN and
    CARPET flies high into the ceiling, then launches a dive bomb attack,
     flying under ABU, scaring him. The flight continues in the
    in the background, while JAFAR and ALI speak in the foreground.)

JAFAR: Where did you say you were from?
ALADDIN: Oh, much further than you have traveled, I'm sure.
        (He smiles. JAFAR does not.)
JAFAR: Try me. (IAGO lands on the stick.)
SULTAN: Watch out, Polly!

(They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes inches above their heads.)
    heads. CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO into the room.)

IAGO: Hey, look at this. Look at him with that stupid rug!

(The CARPET zooms below IAGO, who sighs, wipes his forehead and
    crashes into a pillar. He crashes to the ground and his head
    is surrounded by miniature SULTANS on CARPETs, saying "Have a cracker,
    have a cracker. The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)

SULTAN: Away, I'm coming to land. Jafar,
        look at that! (It lands.)
JAFAR: Spectacular, Your Highness.
SULTAN: Ooh, lovely. Yes, it seems to me that I have a gift for
        he. (CARPET heads towards ABU feeling dizzy, then
        collapses. ABU catches him.) It's a very
        an impressive youth. And a prince too. (Whispers
        to JAFAR) If we're lucky, you won't have to get married
        Jasmine after all.
JAFAR: I don't trust him, Sire.
SULTAN: This is absurd. One thing I'm proud of, Jafar, I am
        an excellent judge of character.
IAGO: Oh, excellent judge, yeah, of course... no!!!

(JASMINE enters quietly.)

SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one!
ALADDIN: And I'm pretty sure I'll love Princess Jasmine!
JAFAR: Your Highness, no. I must intercede with Jasmine
        in the name of. (JASMINE hears this and gets angry.) This
        the boy is no different from the others. Which makes
        does he think he is worthy of the princess?
ALADDIN: Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He stings
        JAFAR's goatee, which springs from all sides
        directions.) Just let her meet me. I will win
        your daughter!
JASMINE: How dare you! (They all look at her in surprise.)
        Are you all here deciding my future? I
        I am not a prize to be won! (She storms out.)
SULTAN: Oh, my God. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just give
        It's time for Jasmine to freshen up. (They go out.)
JAFAR: I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince
        Aboubou.

(Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night. We bow and find
    ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)

ALADDIN: What am I going to do? Jasmine won't even let me
        talk to him. I should have known I couldn't shoot
        of this stupid prince's wish. (ABU struggles with
        his elephant legs to open a banana. He crushes
        and the banana burst into his eyes. Then he
        throw the banana peel in a pile of
        even.)
GENIE: (on the mat, playing chess) So get moving! (the CARPET makes,
        drop a black piece from the board.) Hey.
        It's a good decision. (As Rodney Dangerfield) I
        I can't believe it, I'm losing to an all-in.
ALADDIN: Genius, I need help.
GENIUS: (as Jack Nicholson) All right, Sparky, here's the
        agreement. You want to woo the little lady, you have to
        Be a fair shooter, are you following me?
ALADDIN: What?
GENIE: (Returning to normal, carrying a mortar. He points
        write his words on a blackboard) Tell him
        the truth!!!
ALADDIN: No way! If Jasmine found out I was really someone
        dirty street rat, she would make fun of me. (He
        puts on his turban, which lights up like the GENIUS.)
GENIUS: A woman appreciates a man who knows how to make her laugh!
        (ALADDIN pulls the chain and turns off the light.
        THE GENIUS comes out with the real turban.) Al, all
        joking aside, you really should be yourself.
ALADDIN: Hey, that's the last thing I want to be. All right,
        I'm going to go see her. I have to be sweet, cool,
        confident. What do I look like?
GENIE: (Unfortunately) Like a prince.

(ALADDIN flies to the balcony on CARPET. JASMINE is on her bed,
    sighs. RAJAH is at his side.)

ALADDIN: (From afar) Princess Jasmine?

(RAJAH looks up and groans.)

JASMINE: Who is there?
ALADDIN: It's me, Prince Ali. Ahem--(Then he jumps towards s his
        deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.
JASMINE: I don't want to see you.
ALADDIN: No, no, please, princess. Give me a chance. (RAJAH
        growls and moves towards him.)
JAFAR: Leave me alone.
ALADDIN: Down with kitty!

(Across the balcony, CARPET looks down with GENIE below.)

GENIE: How is our friend?

(CARPET cuts his neck with her finger.)

ALADDIN: Good kitty, take off. Kitten down. (He leaves
        his turban to repel RAJAH.)
JASMINE: (She looks at him thinking she saw him)
        before.) Wait, wait. I know you?
ALADDIN: (quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no.
JASMINE: You remind me of someone I met in the market.
ALADDIN: The market? (A bee buzzes around his head.)
        I have servants who go to the market for me.
        Why do I even have servants who go to the market
        for my servants, so it couldn't be me you
        encounter.
JASMINE: (Looks disappointed.) No, I guess not.
BEE: (It's the GENIUS) Enough about you, Casanova. Talk
        about her! She's smart, funny, the hair, the eyes.
        Anything: choose a feature!
ALADDIN: Uh, Princess Jasmine? You are very...
BEE: Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!
ALADDIN: Punctual!
JASMINE: Punctual?
BEE: Sorry.
ALADDIN: Magnificent.
BEE: Great recovery.
JASMINE: Hmm. I'm rich too, you know.
ALADDIN: Yeah!
JASMINE: The daughter of a sultan
ALADDIN: I know.
JASMINE: A great price for any prince to marry.
ALADDIN: Um, that's true. RIGHT. A prince like me.
BEE: (buzzing in his ear) Watch out! Warning!
JASMINE: That's right, a prince like you. And all the other plush shirts,
             braggart, peacock I met!
BEE: (Back on fire, wearing glasses and crashing) Mayday!
              Help!
JASMINE: Go jump off the balcony! (She turns around and walks away)
ALADDIN: What?
BEE: Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to poke her?
ALADDIN: (He hits the bee) Get out!
BEE: Okay, great. But remember: be yourself! (BEE buzzes
             his turban)
ALADDIN: Yeah, that's true!
JASMINE: What!?!
ALADDIN: Um, you're right. You're not just a reward for being
        won. (He looks disappointed.) You should be free
        to make your own choice. (JASMINE and RAJAH look
        look at each other in confusion.) I'll go now. (He
        climb onto the ledge and climb down.)
JASMIN: No!
ALADDIN: (raises his head over the edge) What? What?
JASMINE: (Now she's surprised) How--how do you do that?
        (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.)
ALADDIN: It's a flying carpet.
JASMINE: It’s lovely. (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a
        glans.)
ALADDIN: You, uh, you don't want to take a ride, do you?
        We could leave the palace, see the world.
JASMINE: Is it safe?
ALADDIN: Of course. Do you trust me?
JASMINE: (She looks at him while saying all this-
        important line) What?
ALADDIN: (Stretching out his hand as before) Do you trust
        Me?
JASMINE: (she smirks) Yes.

(She takes his hand and climbs onto CARPET. He zooms in on the sky,
    putting them both in a sitting position. The music of "A Whole
     New World" swells. JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking
    looking at her questioningly. She gasps as they fly over the palace
     wall and in the sky.)

ALADDIN: I can show you the world
    Brilliant, shimmering, splendid.
    Tell me princess, now when was the last time you stopped by
    Let your heart decide?

(CARPET zooms through the city, stopping slightly to choose a
    flower. He gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE.
      She smiles.)

    I can open my eyes
    Take wonder by wonder
    Over, side and under
    On a flying carpet


(CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms in on the clouds.)

    An entirely new world!
    A fantastic new point of view
    No one to tell us no
    Or where to go
    Or let's say we're just dreaming

(JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from view. CARPET
    flies in and out of the clouds.)

JASMINE: A whole new world
    A dazzling place I've never known
    But when I'm up there
    It's crystal clear
    That now I'm in a whole new world with you!

ALADDIN: Now I'm in a whole new world with you!

(They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues its flight. He
    then circles a column of clouds, giving it a swirling appearance.)

JASMINE: incredible shows
    Indescribable feeling
    Hovering, tumbling, freewheeling
    Through an endless diamond sky

(They join a flock of birds in the sky. One of them looks terrified.
    and screams. CARPET does somersaults and somersaults, sometimes putting
    ALADDIN and JASMINE in free fall, but catching them. They
    zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits.)

JASMINE: A whole new world!
ALADDIN: Don't you dare close your eyes
JASMINE: A hundred thousand things to see
ALADDIN: Hold your breath, it gets better!
JASMINE: I'm like a shooting star,
    I've come this far
    I can't go back to where I was!

(They fly over a river, apparently the Nile, because beyond the
     the sails of the ship are the Great Pyramids. They greet a worker
     sculpt the complete nose of the Sphinx. He smiles, but
    chisel too much and break the front part of the nose.)

ALADDIN: A whole new world!
JASMINE: Every turn is a surprise
ALADDIN: With new horizons to pursue
JASMINE: Every moment, red letter

(They fly alongside running wild horses. JASMINE caresses one of them.)

BOTH: I'll chase them anywhere
    There is time to waste
    Let me share this whole new world with you

    An entirely new world
    This is where we will be

(They cross Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a
    tree and rolls it on his arm towards JASMINE, who is now safe
    she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.)

ALADDIN: A thrilling chase
JASMINE: A wonderful place
BOTH: For you and me!

(CARPET hovers above a lake, and we see the reflection of
    the moon in the lake. Fireworks explode and we see the couple
    during a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a roof.)

JASMINE: It’s so magical.
ALADDIN: Yeah.
JASMINE: (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble)
        It's a shame Abu had to miss this.
ALADDIN: No. He hates fireworks. (TAPIT raises his head
        realizing what's happening.) He doesn't really
        like flying either. (And now ALADDIN realizes it)
        It's... oh no!
JASMINE: (she takes off her turban) You are the boy from
        walk! I knew it. Why did you lie to me?
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I'm sorry.
JASMINE: Did you think I was stupid?
ALADDIN: No!
JASMINE: That I wouldn’t understand?
ALADDIN: No. I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't. No it is not
        what I wanted to say.
JASMIN: Who are you? Tell me the truth!
ALADDIN: The truth? (He looks at CARPET who beckons to him,
        abandon all hope.) The truth...the truth is...I
        sometimes dressing as a commoner to escape the
        pressures of palace life. (THE CARPET COLLAPSES
        defeat.) But I really am a prince! (The pen on
         his turban falls over his eyes.)
JASMINE: Why didn't you tell me?
ALADDIN: Well, you know, uh... royalty goes to the
        town in disguise, it seems a little strange,
        you do not think ?
JASMINE: Not so strange.

(She lifts the feather and snuggles against him. CARPET puts on a
    pompom under his "chin" and looks mystified. Dissolve outside.
    from the balcony of the palace, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return. CARPET
    forms a staircase and it goes down. ALADDIN then comes down
     just below the balcony.)

JASMINE: Good night, my handsome prince.
ALADDIN: Sleep well, princess.

(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps into him and they
    kiss earlier than expected. She walks away slowly then turns around and
    look at him. Finally, she enters his room through the curtain.)

ALADDIN: Yes! (He falls back onto the CARPET, which descends
        on the ground.) For the first time in my life,
        things are starting to go well.

(He looks up at JASMINE's balcony and four pairs of hands grab him.)

ALADDIN: Hey! What? (A gag is tied around his mouth.
        Muffled words) Abu! Abu! (We see the elephant
        suspended from a net attached to a tree.)
GUARD: Hold him!

(Chains are placed on his feet and hands. Another GUARD ties
    CARPET in a knot around a tree.)

JAFAR: I fear you have worn out your welcome, Prince
        Aboubou. (He walks away.) Make sure he's
        never found.

(A GUARD hits him in the head and he falls unconscious. Cut to a
    cliff, where the GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body falls into the water.
      He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock. The rock
     hits the bottom of the sea, then the turban lands and the lamp falls
    out. He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp. However, he
    loses consciousness and falls to the ground. The lamp, unstable
    by its movement, rolls and rubs against his hands. It trembles,
    and GENIUS emerges with a bath brush, a rubber ducky and a shower cap)

GENIUS: Never fail. Take the bath and it's a friction
        the lamp. (duck squeaks) Hello. (see
        ALADDIN unconscious) Al? Al! Kid, stop!
        You can't cheat on this one! I can not help you
        unless you make a wish. You must say "Genius, I
        I want you to save my life." Understood? Ok. Come on
        Aladdin!! (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and
        shakes him. His head rises, then falls.) I will
        take that as a yes. (The head turns into a mermaid.)
        Wow! Wow! (Transforms into a submarine.)
        scope! (He babbles something that sounds like
        German. On the surface, a giant waterspout
        emerges and lands on top of the cliff. ALADDIN
        wakes up and coughs up water from his lungs.)
        Don't scare me like that!
ALADDIN: Genie, I--uh, I-uh... (He doesn't know how to say
        then they kiss.) Thanks, Genie.
GENIE: Oh, Al. I'm starting to like you, kid. Not
        that I want to choose curtains or something.

(Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing
   her hair. The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors, hypnotized.)

SULTAN: Jasmine!
JASMINE: Oh, father, I just had the most wonderful time.
        I am so happy.
SULTAN: (Still monotonous from hypnosis) You should be,
        Jasmine. I chose a husband for you.
JASMIN: What?
SULTAN: (The other door opens to reveal JAFAR.) You will
        marry Jafar.

(JASMINE gasps at the sight.)

JAFAR: You are speechless, I see. Great quality in a
        marry.
JASMINE: I will never marry you. (She goes to the SULTAN)
        Father, I choose Prince Ali!
JAFAR: Prince Ali is gone!

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in front of the balcony door.)

ALADDIN: You better check your crystal ball again, Jafar!
JASMINE: Prince Ali!

(JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.)

IAGO: How the hell... (back to the parrot)... uh, awk!
ALADDIN: Tell them the truth, Jafar! You tried to get me
        kill.
JAFAR: What? (He goes to the SULTAN) Ridiculous
        This is absurd, Your Highness. He's obviously lying.
        (He brings the stick closer to the SULTAN's face.)
SULTAN: Obviously... lying.

(ALADDIN sees the staff with his glowing eyes.)

JASMINE: Father, what is wrong with you?
ALADDIN: I know!

(ALADDIN grabs the stick and smashes it on the ground. JAFAR jumps.
    and the spell is broken for good.)

SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh my God!
ALADDIN: Your Highness, Jafar controls you with
        This! (He brings the stick forward)
SULTAN: What? Jafar? You, traitor!

(The trio advances on JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Your Majesty, all this can be explained.
SULTAN: Guards! Guards!
IAGO: Well, that's all, we're dead, forget it. Just
        dig a grave for both of us. Were dead.

(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket. He makes a movement, but
    is seized by the guards.)

SULTAN: Arrest Jafar immediately.
JAFAR: It's not done yet, my boy!

(JAFAR takes a vial from his pocket. ALADDIN sees him and rushes
    him, but JAFAR throws the vial on the ground. A big red cloud
    appears. When he's gone, so will JAFAR.)

SULTAN: Find it, search everywhere!
ALADDIN: Jasmine, are you okay?
JASMIN: Yes.

(They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN bursts in between them.)

SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted advisor, is plotting against
        me all this time. Simply horrible. How will I ever-
        (He stops mid-sentence and looks at the two men.)
        Can this be true? My daughter finally chose one
        suitor? (She nods) Ha ha! Praise Allah! You
        awesome boy, I could kiss you! I won't - I will
        leave that to my.... You will be married at the same time!
        Yes yes. And you will be happy and prosperous, and
        then my boy, you will be sultan!
ALADDIN: Sultan?
SULTAN: Yes, a brave honest young man like you, a
        a person of your impeccable moral character is
        exactly what this kingdom needs! (ALADDIN looks
        worried about this.)

(Cut to inside JAFAR's apartments. JAFAR and IAGO enter.)

IAGO: We have to get out of here! We have to get... I have to
        Start packing, Your Highness. Only the essentials.
        (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage.
        JAFAR smiles broadly.) Travel light! Bring him
        guns, weapons, knives (Stops and leaves
        a photo of him and JAFAR) and how about
        this image? I don't know - I think I'm doing one
        weird face in it. (JAFAR starts laughing wildly.)
        Oh, boy, has he gone crazy. It's cracked. (IAGO
        flies towards him and hits his head.) Jafar?
        Jafar? Pull yourself together, Jafar! (JAFAR catches it everywhere
        neck) Good grip!
JAFAR: Prince Ali is nothing more than this kid in rags
        Aladdin. He has the lamp, Iago.
IAGO: Why is it miserable...
JAFAR: But you're going to get rid of it!
Iago: Me?

(Cut to outside the palace. ALADDIN looks at the gardens.)

ALADDIN: Sultan? They want me to be sultan?

(GENIE comes out of the lamp)

GENIE: Huzzah! Hail to the conquering hero! (Turns into
        a one-man band. He sees ALADDIN walking away with his
        head down. He stops, scratches his head, arrives
        with an idea, then zooms in on ALADDIN. He holds
        he raises his hands like a director framing a film and
        we go through them.) Aladdin, you just won
        the heart of the princess. What are you going to do
        following? (ALADDIN looks at him, then walks away
        sadness in bed, where he falls on it and sighs.
        GENIE is confused again, then goes to him and shoots
        a script called "Aladdin". Whispering :)
        Psst, your sentence is "I will release the genie".
        Anytime.
ALADDIN: Genius... I can't.
GENIE: Of course you can. You just say "Genius, I wish you
        free." (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses
        him as a simulated ventriloquist's dummy. ALADDIN walks away.)
ALADDIN: I'm serious. Look, I'm sorry, I really am. But
        they want to make me a sultan - no!, they want to make me
        Prince Ali Sultan. Without you, I'm just Aladdin.
GENIE: Al, you win!
ALADDIN: Because of you! The only reason people think I am
        it's all because of you. And if they find out
        I'm not really a prince? (Calmly) What if
        Jasmine finds out? I'm going to lose it. Genius, I can't
        keep it up for myself. I can't wish you freedom.
GENIE: (Sarcastically) Hey, I understand. After all,
        you lied to everyone. Hey, I was starting
        Feel excluded. Now if you'll excuse me,
        master. (He says the last word with disgust, then
        beanbags returns to the lamp.)

(ABU and CARPET watch from the window.)

ABU: Ohhh.
ALADDIN: Genie, I'm so sorry. (A tongue comes out of
        beak and raspberries him.) Well, very good. (He snaps
        a pillow on the LAMP.) So just stay inside
        there! (He looks at ABU and CARPET.) What are you doing?
        are the guys watching? (They both leave.) Look, I–I'm
        Sorry. Wait, Abu... wait... I'm sorry, I didn't...
        wait, come on. (He sighs.) What am I doing?
        Genie is right: I have to tell Jasmine the truth.
JASMINE: (from a distance) Ali, oh Ali, will you come here?
ALADDIN: (putting on his turban) Well, there you go. (He walks
        in the garden.) Jasmine? Where are you?

(We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO
    in the pond. He imitates JASMINE's voice.)

IAGO: Ahem... In the menagerie, hurry up.
ALADDIN: I'm coming.

(We see ALADDIN passing in haste, without noticing the birds. IAGO laughs,
    then turns around and looks at the face of a FLAMINGO, which is
    panting.)

FLAMINGO: Uh!
IAGO: Do you have a problem, pinky? (He sweeps the bird away
        feet out from under. IAGO runs into the palace
        and finds the lamp under the pillow.) Boy, Jafar's
        I will be happy to see you! (he stretches his face
        like that of JAFAR and imitates it.) Good job, Iago!
        (Normal) Ah, continue. (JAFAR) No, really, on a scale
        from one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah,
        Jafar, you are so kind. I'm embarrassed, I'm
        to blush. (He flies away with the lamp.)

(Cut to the entrance to the palace. The SULTAN stands at the top, making
    an announcement to the people.)

SULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a
        suitor!

(Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is looking. ALADDIN
    appears at the bottom of the stairs.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine?
JASMINE: Ali, where have you been?
ALADDIN: There is something I must tell you.
JASMINE: The entire kingdom turned to the father
        announcement!
ALADDIN: No! But Jasmine, please listen to me!
JASMINE: Good luck! (She pushes him onto the platform
        with the SULTAN, where it overlooks the whole
        crowd.)
SULTAN: ...Ali Ababwa!
ALADDIN: Oh, my boy!

(Far above, IAGO and JAFAR look through a window.)

IAGO: Look at them, they're applauding that little squeaker.
JAFAR: Let them applaud.

 (He lifts the lamp and rubs it. THE GENIUS comes out.)

GENIUS: You know Al, I get it (turns around and sees JAFAR)
        reallyyyyyy--I don't think you're him. (He
        goes down and consults a poster.) This evening, the
        The role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and
        sinister ugly man.
JAFAR: I am your master now. (He throws the GENIUS to
        ground and places his foot on GENIUS' face.)
GENIE: I was afraid of that.
JAFAR: Genie, grant me my first wish. I would like to rule on
        high, as sultan!!!

(Cut to where dark clouds surround the castle. The castle shakes.
    The roof tears off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN shoot each other.)

ALADDIN: Wow!
SULTAN: Bless my soul. What is this? What is going on?

(His turban takes off his head. When he grabs it, his whole body
    flies away, then is stripped of all his clothes except his boxers
     shorts. The clothes reappear on JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Hey hey hey!
SULTAN: Jafar, you vile traitor.
IAGO: For you, it's Sultan Vile Betrayer.
ALADDIN: Oh, yeah? Well, we'll just see that! (Drawn
        takes off his own turban, but finds it empty) The lamp!
JAFAR: Finders-keepers, Abooboo.

(They both look up and see a gigantic GENIUS raising the palace towards
    the clouds... ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies away to greet him.
      They fly near the GENIE's head.)

ALADDIN: Genius! No!
GENIE: Sorry, kid, I have a new master now. (He places the
        palace on top of a mountain.)
SULTAN: Jafar, I order you to stop!
JAFAR: There is a new order now: my order! Finally, you
        will bow me down!

(The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.)

JAFAR: We will never bow to you!
IAGO: Why am I not surprised?
JAFAR: If you don't bow to a sultan, then you will
        cower before a wizard! (TO GENIUS) Genius, my
        second wish - I wish to be the most powerful
        wizard of the world!

(GENIE holds out his finger. ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he can't,
    and another GENIE(tm) brand lightning strikes JAFAR,
     restoring it to its normal appearance.)

IAGO: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Agrabah for
        Wizard Jafar!
JAFAR: Now where were we? Ah yes, an abject humiliation!
        (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his stick, and
        they both bow before him. RAJAH rushes towards him.
        He zaps RAJAH and the tiger turns into a kitten.
        cat.) Down, my boy! Oh, princess... (lifts chin
        with his team) - there is someone I'm dying for
        you present.
ALADDIN: (off camera) Jafar! Don't touch her!

(JAFAR zaps ALADDIN. CARPET flies away.)

JAFAR: Prince Ali
    Yes it's him,
    But not as you know it.
    Read my lips and understand
    With reality

(JAFAR brings them both together in the air.)

    Yes, meet a blast from your past
    Whose lies were too good to last
    Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!

(JAFAR brings ALI back to ALADDIN.)

IAGO: Or should we say Aladdin?
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I tried to tell you.

JAFAR: So Ali turns out to be just Aladdin
    Just a scam, should I continue?
    Take it from me
    His personality flaws
    Give me an adequate reason
    To send him packing on a one-way ticket
    So his prospects take a terminal plunge
    His assets frozen, the location chosen
    It's the end of the earth, whoopee!
    So long,
IAGO: Goodbye, see you soon!
JAFAR: Ex-Prince Ali!

(JAFAR has returned ABU to normal. He sends them both to
    a large pillar, then launch it like a rocket, but not before
    CARPET can enter. F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where
    the pillar crashes and rolls. It eventually stops.
    ALADDIN emerges, visibly very cold.)

ALADDIN: Abu? Abu! (He looks at a shaking pile of
        snow.) Oh, this is all my fault - I should have
        I released the genie when I had the chance. (He digs
        takes out ABU and rocks him in his vest.) Abu!
        Do you agree? I'm sorry, Abu, I made a mess
        everything, one way or another. I have to go back and settle down
        things are good. (He starts walking in the snow,
        and he ends up walking on a frozen CARPET.)
        Carpet! (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by
        the pillar. He shoots to try to free CARPET. He
        can't do it, so he starts shoveling the snow
        base of the pillar.) Abu, start digging! It is
        he! (Finally enough snow has been cleared, and
        the pillar begins to roll. ALADDIN flees,
        looks back, then settles into place. The pillar
        turns on him, and when he is gone, ALADDIN and
        ABU remains seated in the layer of snow created by
        the pillar window.) Yeah! All right! (He
        looks up at his turban, made of scared ABU.
        CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes to collect
        raise them.) Now, let's return to Agrabah! Let's go!

(We return to a long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds.
    Cut to int. and slow zoom of the throne room. IAGO to the SULTAN
    tied like a puppet, and JASMINE is chained next to the
    throne.)

IAGO: The puppet leader wants a cracker? Here's your cracker.
        Shove them all down your throat. Here, have
        a lot !

(JAFAR pulls the chain and JASMINE approaches him holding an apple.)

JAFAR: Leave him alone!

(IAGO stops for a second, then continues.)

JAFAR: It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine.
        (He bites into the apple she is holding.)
        A beautiful desert flower like you should be
        on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.
        (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What are you doing?
        you say, my darling? Why, with you as queen...

(She takes a glass of wine and throws it in his face.)

JASMINE: Never!
JAFAR: I'm going to teach you some respect! (She falls back as he
        raises his hand to slap her. Then he stops.) No.
        Genius, I decided to make my last wish. I
        wish princess jasmine to fall desperately
        love with me.

(We see ALADDIN running back into town.)

GENIE: (again in Buckley form) Ah, master... there are a few
        addenda, considerations
JAFAR: Don't answer me, you stupid blue thug! You
        I will do what I order you to do, slave!

(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, waving at her
    play at the same time.)

JASMINE: (She gets up and puts the crown on her head.)
        Jafar! I never realized how amazing it was
        you are beautiful.

(The GENIUS' jaw drops.)

JAFAR: It's better. (He raises the GENIUS' jaw like a
        shadow.) Now, kitty, tell me more
        about me.
JASMINE: You are tall, well dressed...

(JAFAR approaches her. ALADDIN jumps with ABU and GENIE
    sees them.)

GENIE: Al! Al, little friend!
ALADDIN: Shh!
GENIE: (Literally closes his mouth, then opens it.)
        Al, I can't help you. I work for a psychopath.
        NOW. (His head transforms into JAFAR's, then returns.)
ALADDIN: Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? (He rezippers the GENIE
        mouth.) I'm going to improvise.

(He slides a pile of coins and hides near JAFAR and JASMINE.
    JAFAR turns his back on ALADDIN.)

JAFAR: Continue.
JASMINE: And your beard... is so... crooked! (She has it
        arm around him. She pretends to twist with her
        finger, but she's actually waving at ALADDIN
        Forthcoming. He makes his move. IAGO sees it.)

IAGO: Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.)
JAFAR: And the street rat?
JASMINE: What street rat?

(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl. JAFAR
    turns to look, but JASMINE catches up and kisses him. ALADDIN
     looks disgusted. Both IAGO and ABU look disgusted.)

ABU: Yuck!
JAFAR: It was... (he sees the reflection of ALADDIN in her
        crown.) You!! How many times have I
        to kill you, my boy?

 (He zaps ALADDIN. JASMINE rushes at him, and he throws her to the
    ground. ALADDIN rushes and grabs the stick.)

ALADDIN: Get the lamp!

(JASMINE runs towards him. JAFAR, however, shakes ALADDIN, then
    puts it in an hourglass.)

JAFAR: Ah, ah, ah, princess - Your time is up!

(Sand begins to fall from above on her.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine!
IAGO: Oh, nice move, Jaf... (he is knocked out by ABU.)

(ABU rushes towards the lamp.)

JAFAR: Don't play with me! (He is transformed into a toy monkey.
ALADDIN: Abu!


(TAPIT rushes.)

JAFAR: Things are moving fast now, boy. (THE CARPET is
        zapped and undone. ALADDIN rushes towards the
        lamp.) Do you understand? (His path is blocked by
        large swords stuck in the ground. JAFAR takes over
        the lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a
        the sword from the ground.) I'm just warming up
        up! (He spits a ring of fire around ALADDIN.)
ALADDIN: Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you coward
        snake?
JAFAR: A snake, right? Perhaps you would like to see how
        I can be like a snake! (He smiles broadly, and we
        see a snake's tongue sticking out from behind yours
        teeth. He then transforms into a giant cobra, and
        the ring of fire around ALADDIN is part of the
        snake encircling ALADDIN. The snake that JAFAR makes
        moves to ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN
        swings the sword and hits JAFAR. Cut to GENIUS
        cheerleaders wearing “A” sweaters.)

GENIUS: Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake – thrust that sword into
        this snake!
JAFAR: Stay out of it!

(GENIE waving a small pennant with a “J” on it.)

GENIUS: (weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man - if he can't do it,
        GREAT!

(ALADDIN takes advantage of the distraction to take a break towards the hourglass where
    JASMINE is trapped. However, JAFAR sees him and blocks the path.
     ALADDIN is thrown and he loses his sword.)

JASMINE: Aladdin!

(ALADDIN jumps onto a large gemstone and slides along the ground, grabbing
    the sword in its path. He turns a corner, but the snake that chases him
    can't, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and
    hangs outside the palace. ALADDIN jumps on the snake's back
     and stabs him. JAFAR screams in agony. ALADDIN tries again to
     free the princess.)

ALADDIN: Wait, Jasmine!

(He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR catches him.)

JAFAR: (laughing hideously) You little fool! You thought
        you could defeat the most powerful being on the planet!
IAGO: (with GENIUS coming up behind him) Squeeze him,
        Jafar – Squeeze it like a – awk! (GENIE nudges him
        out of the way)
JAFAR: Without genius, my boy, you are nothing!
ALADDIN: (has an idea) Genius! The genius! The genius
        has more power than you will ever have!
JAFAR: What!!
ALADDIN: He gave you your power, he can take it back from you!
GENIE: Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing me
        in it ?
ALADDIN: Admit it, Jafar: you're still just a stopgap!
JAFAR: You are right! His power exceeds mine! But
        not for a long time!

(JAFAR revolves around the GENIE.)

GENIUS: This boy is crazy. He's a little drunk on punch. A
        too many blows with the snake (his hand
        turns into a snake and hits his head with it.)
JAFAR: Slave, I make my third wish! I wish to be whole
        powerful genius!
GENIE: (reluctantly) Very well, your wish is my command.
        Well done, Al.

(GENIE zaps JAFAR with the latest flash of the GENIE (tm) brand.
    JAFAR's snake form dissipates and he transforms into a genie. We
     see JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand. ALADDIN
    runs and finally breaks the glass. Sand and princess
     dump.)

JAFAR: Yes! Yes! The power! Absolute power!
JASMINE: (to ALADDIN) What did you do?
ALADDIN: Believe me!

(A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base. JAFAR is conjuring.)

JAFAR: The universe is mine, I command it, I control it!
ALADDIN: Not so fast, Jafar! Aren't you forgetting something?
    (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genius, you
    I understood! And everything that goes with it!

(Chains appear on JAFAR's wrists.)

JAFAR: No! No!
IAGO: I'm leaving here! Come on, you are the
        genius, I don't want...

(IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked into JAFAR.)

ALADDIN: Phenomenal cosmic powers! A very small living space.
GENIUS: Al, you little genius, you!

(ABU returns to normal, the CARPET resurfaces, JASMINE, the SULTAN
    and RAJAH are together. RAJAH jumps into the arms of
     the SULTAN, then they are all transformed. The SULTAN is crushed
     because of the weight of the new RAJAH. The palace reappears
     where he was in the city. ALADDIN finds himself holding the
    new lamp.)

JAFAR: (both from inside the lamp.) Get your damn beak.
        out of my face!
IAGO: Oh, shut up, you moron!
JAFAR: Don't tell me to shut up!
GENIE: Allow me. (He takes the lamp and goes to
        balcony. He now wears a baseball cap. He
        ends as if to throw away the lamp, but opens its
        palm flat and throws it into the desert
        with his finger.) Ten thousand years in a cave
        wonders should relax him!

(JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they disappear. JASMINE walks.
    to ALADDIN. They hold hands, but both look sad.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine, I'm sorry for lying to you about being a
        prince.
JASMINE: I know why you did it.
ALADDIN: Well, I guess...this is...goodbye? (GENIE pushes
        his head on the corner is shocked by what he is
        hearing.)
JASMINE: Oh, this stupid law. It's not fair, I love you.
GENIE: (wipes a tear) Al, no problem. You still have
        I have one wish left. Just say the word and you're one
        the prince again.
ALADDIN: But Genie, what about your freedom?
GENIE: Hey, it's just an eternity of servitude. It is
        love. (He leans next to her.) Al, you are
        I won't find another girl like her in a million
        years. Believe me, I know. I watched.
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I love you, but I have to stop
        pretend to be something I'm not.
JASMINE: I understand.

(They look into each other's eyes one last time, then ALADDIN turns around
    to ENGINEERING.)

ALADDIN: Genie, I wish for your freedom.
GENIUS: A true pedigree of a prince to come. What I ?
ALADDIN: (He holds out the lamp towards GENIUS.) Genius, you are
        free!

(A transformation scene follows, in which the chains fall
    The GENIE's wrist and the lamp fall uselessly to the ground.
     GENIE picks it up and looks at it.)

GENIE: (He can't believe it.) Hey, hey! I'm free. I am
        free. (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.) Quickly,
        quickly, wish for something extraordinary. Say "I want
        the Nile. » Wish the Nile. Try this!
ALADDIN: I wish for the Nile.
GENIE: No way!! (Laughing hysterically. He bounces
        the balcony like a pinball machine.) Oh, does it feel
        GOOD! I'm free! I'm finally free! I hit
        the road. I'm off to discover the world! I--

(He packs a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking
    very sad.)

ALADDIN: Genie, I'm going to miss you.
GENIE: Me too, Al. No matter what anyone says, you will do it
        always be a prince to me.

(They kiss. The SULTAN comes forward.)

SULTAN: That's true. You have certainly proven your worth
        as far as I'm concerned. It is this law which is
        issue.
JASMINE: Father?
SULTAN: Well, am I sultan or am I sultan? From this day on
        from now on the princess will marry whoever she judges
        worthy.
JASMINE: (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDIN's arms.)
        Him! I choose... I choose you, Aladdin.
ALADDIN: Ha, ha. Call me Al.

(They are about to kiss when giant blue hands gather everyone together.
    GENIE is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy
     hat.)

GENIE: Oh, all of you. Come here. Big group hug!
        Do you mind if I kiss the monkey? (He kisses ABU.) Ooh,
        hair ball ! Well I can't do any more damage around here
        this ice cream stand. I am leaving! Bye Bye,
        you two crazy lovebirds. Hey, Rugman: ciao! I am
        history! No, I am mythology! No I do not care
        what I am, I am free!

(The GENIUS flies into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparks
    behind him. They cut (a jump to make things worse)
     to fireworks exploding over a nocturnal landscape. We bow and see
     ALADDIN and JASMINE flying on CARPET.)

ALADDIN: A Whole New World
JASMINE: A whole new life
BOTH: (with off-camera chorus) For you and me!
MEN'S CHOIR: A whole new world!

(They fly away in the moonlight, and having disappeared,
    the moon turns and reveals the laughing face of the GENIUS. Suddenly
    the film is grabbed "out of the projector", the GENIUS lifts it
     and looks at the audience.)

GENIUS: I made you watch!

(Returns the film to normal, with the moon normal. Fade to black.
    The end.)

[Fade to black. A tendril of purple mist in front of a wall of red flames.
The mist forms in golden letters: “Aladdin”. The letters sparkle, then fly away.
In a desert, a small peddler rides a camel and sings in the silent night as the opening credits roll.]

Peddler:

♪ Oh, I come from a country, from a far away place ♪

♪ Where the camels of the caravan wander ♪

♪ Where they cut off your ear, if they don't like your face ♪ / ♪ Where it's flat and huge, and the heat is intense ♪

♪ It’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home! ♪

♪ When the wind comes from the east and the sun from the west and the sand in the glass is just right ♪

♪ Get off, stop, jump on a mat and fly away to another Arabian night! ♪

[Above the dunes, we are shown the town of Agrabah. The castle absolutely dominates the view, while the merchant sings as he approaches the town border.]

Peddler:

♪ Arab nights, like Arab days ♪

♪ More often than not, it's hotter than hot ♪

♪ In many ways! ♪

[The camera pans to a city street, where a fire-eater is performing his act. It spits flames, which brings us back to the peddler.]

♪ The thousand and one nights, under the Arab moons ♪

♪ A fool, unprepared, could fall and fall hard ♪

♪ Over there on the dunes ♪

[The tired camel, panting and trembling on its four legs, collapses and its driver slides nimbly on its back.
He shakes his hands while addressing the spectator(s)]

Peddler: Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. (greeting) Please, please come closer.

[The camera zooms in and presses itself against the peddler's face]

Peddler: (uncomfortably) Ugh... Too close. A little too close.

[Luckily, for all concerned, the camera is pulled back a bit]

Peddler: Ah, there. Welcome to Agrabah... (lights a flame) City of mystery... (clutching his camel's head) Of enchantment...

[He opens the pouch on the camel's back, which suddenly transforms into a fully decorated bazaar stall.]

Peddler: And the finest wares this side of the Jordan, on sale today. Get off. Eh eh.

[He takes out a rather visible vase from the top of the stall.]

Peddler: Look at that. Yes. Hookah and coffee maker combination. (by pressing it against a potato) Also allows you to make julienne fries. Will not break.
(slaps him on the table) Won’t be…

[Boing! The upper end comes off.]

Pedlar: (expressionless) It broke. (tossing it aside) Ohh! Look at this. (takes out a box) I've never seen one intact before.
This is the famous Tupperware from the Dead Sea. Listen...

[He opens it and, for effect, blows out a raspberry]

Peddler: Ah, it's always good.

[It’s clear now: that doesn’t interest us. The camera begins to pan away from the peddler, who is hurriedly trying to catch up with us.]

Peddler: (waving his hands) Wait, don't go! (smiling) I see that you are only interested in what is exceptionally rare.
I think you would then be well rewarded for considering... this.

[The peddler takes the now iconic magic lamp from his sleeve and holds it gently in his hands.]

Pedlar: Don't let his plain appearance fool you. As with many things, it's not what's on the outside that matters, but what's on the inside.

[Again, the camera pans away. The peddler does not give up, however, struggling once again to remain in sight of his potential buyer(s)]

Pedlar: (anxious) This is no ordinary lamp! It changed the course of a young man's life.
A young man who loved this lamp was more than he seemed. (looking around, whispering) A diamond in the rough. (smiling)
Maybe you would like to hear the story?

[The peddler pours the shining sand from the lamp into his hand...]

Pedlar: It starts with a dark night...

[...and throws it into the sky, where it forms a starry nightscape.]

Peddler (vo): Where a dark man waits... with a dark goal...

(The camera tilts toward an open patch of desert, where, perched above a mountain of sand atop a horse, Jafar waits.
His companion, a parrot named Iago, still sits on his shoulder, while from the shadows a rather disheveled man walks towards them.
Newcomer Gazeem dismounts and admires the two.]

Jafar: You...are late.

Gazeem: (bowing) Many apologies, O Patient One.

Jafar: You have it, then?

Gazeem: I had to cut a few throats, but I managed.

[He takes out a medallion: half of a golden beetle. Jafar reaches out to get it, but Gazeem pulls it away]

Gazeem: Ah-ah-ahhh. (extending his free hand) The treasure.

[Iago shouts as he passes and grabs the medallion]

Gazeem: Ouch!

Jafar: Trust me, my prickly friend. You will get what comes to you.

Iago: What's wrong with you? Awk!

(Jafar takes out the second half of the medallion. He connects them, forming a golden beetle. It comes to life and flies away.)

Jafar: Quick! Follow the trail!

(On horseback, the trio pursues the medallion through the moonlit desert)

Jafar: Faster!

[The creature splits in two, each half lodging itself in a sand dune. An imposing tiger's head rises from the dune.
The pieces of the beetle form its glowing eyes. The men's horses rear up on their hind legs, toppling their riders.
Jafar smiles as the tiger head opens its cavernous mouth]

[the horse whinnies]

[howling wind]

Jafar: Finally, after all my years of searching... the Cave of Wonders.

Iago: Awk. Cave of Wonders!

Gazeem: (whispering) By Allah...

Jafar: Now remember. Bring me the lamp! The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp... is mine. [laughs]

(Gazeem begins to approach the lion's mouth, which is the entrance to the cave. He laughs as he walks away.)

Iago: Oh, the lamp. Oh, the lamp. (Now that Iago and Jafar are alone, Iago opens up in normal English.) Damn, where did you find that bozo?

(Jafar puts his finger to his lips and shushes him. Gazeem crawls towards the oral entrance of the cave.
He looks inside the mouth as his tongue turns into a staircase.
He tiptoes around one of the tiger's fangs, but is amazed by the roar of the cave's words.)

Cave: [echoing growl] Who is disturbing my sleep?

Gazeem: [the thief gasps] It's me, Gazeem, a humble thief.

Cave: Know this. Only one can enter here. The one whose value lies far away. A diamond in the rough.

(Gazeem turns to Jafar with a questioning look.)

Jafar: What are you waiting for? Keep on going.

[the beast sighs]

(Gazeem hesitates, then steps one foot inside the cave. With great apprehension, he puts his foot down. Nothing happens.
Relieved, he resumes his journey. Then another roar comes. He turns around, but the lion's mouth closes and the dune returns to normal.
All that remains is Jafar, Iago and the two separated halves of the medallion.)

Jafar: NOOOOOO!

Cave: Look for... the rough diamond...

Iago: [coughs] I can't believe it. I just don't believe it! We'll never get our hands on that stupid lamp!
Forget that ! Look at this. Look at this. I'm so tickled I'm molting. (He flies to Jafar's shoulder.)

Jafar: Patience, Iago. Patience. Gazeem obviously wasn't worth it.

Iago: (extremely sarcastic) Oh, there's a big surprise. It's incredible... I think I'm going to have a heart attack and die from this surprise.
What are we going to do? We have a big problem here, a big-

[Jafar pinches his beak]

Jafar: Yes. Only one can enter. I have to find this one, this... diamond in the rough.

(Cut to a roof, where Aladdin rushes to the edge, carrying a loaf of bread. He almost drops it over the edge.)

Razoul: Stop! Thief! I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat!

Aladdin: (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.) All this for a loaf of bread? Whoooaa!

(He jumps and lands on two ropes strung between buildings, with clothes drying on them.
He looks through them, picking up pieces of clothing on himself as he goes.
Finally, he approaches the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches out and slams the shutters.
Aladdin slams against the shutters and falls onto the street, his fall broken by numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him.
He takes off the first layer of clothes and is about to eat his bread when...)

Guard 1: There he is!

Guard 2: You won't get away with this easily!

Aladdin: Do you think it was easy?

(He looks at three women and makes fun of him.)

Razoul: You two, this way, and you, follow me. We will find him.

(Aladdin puts a sheet over himself and wraps himself up to disguise himself. He rushes towards the women.)

Aladdin: Hello, ladies.

Woman 1: We're in trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin?

Aladdin: A problem? Certainly not. You'll only get in trouble if you get caught.

(A hand grabs Aladdin's shoulder and pulls him back. It's Razoul. Aladdin's disguise falls off.)

Razoul: I got you!

Aladdin: I'm in trouble.

Razoul: And this time... (A howling cry from Abu, then the guard's turban is lowered over his eyes. Abu points to the guard's head, laughing.)

Aladdin: Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

Abu: Hello.

Aladdin: Come on. Let's get out of here. I have to keep...

(A guard swings at Aladdin, but destroys a barrel of fish. Abu raspberries the guard, then dodges an attack. Then Aladdin pulls down the guard's pants)

♪ One jump ahead of the finish line ♪

♪ One step ahead of the sword ♪

♪ I only steal what I can't afford ♪ That's all.

(Aladdin runs away, the guard passes a fish over his lower body like pants.)

♪ A step ahead of the law ♪

♪ That's it and it's not a joke ♪

♪ These guys don't like that I'm broke! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu run over a pile of barrels, then hit one on the guards.)

Guards: (One at a time) ♪ Riffraff! ♪

♪ Street rat! ♪

♪ Scoundrel! ♪

(throws fruit at Aladdin) ♪ Take that! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Just a little snack, guys. ♪

Guards: ♪ Tear it up, take it back, guys! ♪

(Aladdin runs to the top of a platform. The guards shake the platform back and forth to try to make him fall.)

Aladdin: ♪ I can understand ♪

♪ I have to face the facts ♪

(Aladdin jumps from the platform to certain death, only to grab Abu's hands like an acrobat. The couple swings in a harem.)

♪ You are my only friend, Abu! ♪

Harem girls: who?

♪ Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom ♪

(Abou finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth like a chipmunk.)

♪ He became a single man to increase crime ♪

Woman 2: ♪ I would blame the parents, but he doesn't have them. ♪

Aladdin: ♪ I must eat to live, ♪

♪ I have to steal to eat ♪

♪ I'll tell you all about it when I have time! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu come out and bounce on an awning. Cut to a muscular man leaning into the crowd. The guards rush in.
Cut to Aladdin and Abu behind the muscular man, matching his movements, until they make a mistake and are discovered. )

♪ A jump ahead of slowpokes. ♪

♪ One step before my loss. ♪

♪ Next time I'll use a pen name. ♪

Razoul: There he is!

(A chase sequence, in which Aladdin and Abu, pursued by guards, run through a flock of sheep and hit an artist sleeping on a bed of nails.
[of course, an extremely large guard lands on him])

Aladdin: ♪ A leap ahead of the hitmen ♪

♪ One step ahead of the herd ♪

♪ I think I'll take a walk around the neighborhood ♪

(Abou disguises himself with jewelry until a shopkeeper discovers him.)

Man 1: ♪ Stop, thief! ♪

Shopkeeper 1: ♪ Vandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Abu! ♪

Woman 3: ♪ Scandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Let's not be in too much of a hurry ♪

(Aladdin is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens and a tall, ugly lady comes out)

Lady: ♪ However, I find it rather tasty! ♪

(Aladdin tumbles, then puts his arm around a guard, acting like they're all friends.)

Aladdin: ♪ I must eat to live, ♪

♪ I have to steal to eat ♪

♪ Otherwise, we would get along well! ♪

Guards: WRONG!

(The guards jump at Aladdin, but get tangled. Their targets sneak into pots)

Main Guard: Get him!

(Aladdin jumps onto an artist walking harmlessly across hot coals. The guards rush through the coals, jumping in pain as they burn their feet.
Aladdin and Abu come across a sword swallower, then Abu returns to remove the sword from the swallower's mouth. Abu walks towards the guards, who stop in fear.)

Guard: He has a sword!

Razoul: You idiots. We all have swords!

(The guards draw their swords. Abu puts down his sword and runs away. Aladdin and Abu are surrounded again, with guards coming from left and right.
He jumps and climbs a dress trick in progress on the street, as the guards all crash into each other.)

Aladdin: ♪ One jump ahead of the beating of hooves ♪

Guards: Vandal!

Aladdin: ♪ One jump ahead of the hump ♪

Guards: Street rat!

Aladdin: ♪ One turn before disaster ♪

Guards: Scoundrel!

Aladdin: ♪ They are fast, but I am much faster ♪

Guards: Take that!

(The guards chase Aladdin up a staircase into a room. He grabs a rug...)

Aladdin: ♪ There you go, ♪

♪ You better get your hands on it ♪

♪ Wish me a safe landing, ♪

♪ All I have to do is jump! ♪

(..and jumps out the window like the carpet was magic.
The guards follow him out the window, but they fall straight into the street,
and land in a fertilizer cart with the "Crazy Hakim's Discount Fertilizer" sign. )

Guards: Yuck! Hey!

(Aladdin uses the carpet as a parachute to land safely and out of danger. Aladdin and Abu greet each other)

Aladdin: And now, esteemed effendi, we feast. All right.

(Aladdin breaks the bread in two and gives half to Abu who begins to eat.
But Aladdin looks and sees two young children rummaging through the trash looking for food.
The girl sees him, then drops her find and tries to hide. Aladdin looks at them solemnly, then at the bread, then Abou.)

Abu: Yum, yum! Uh-oh.

(Abou takes a big bite of his food, but Aladdin gets up and walks towards the children. The girl pulls her brother back.)

Aladdin: [sighs] Here. Keep on going. Take it.

(The children laugh with joy. Abu tries to swallow his mouthful, then looks guilty. He walks towards the children and offers them his bread.
Delighted, they stroke him on the head.)

Abu: Ah, don't do it. Eh?

(ABU sees ALADDIN enter the daylight, where a parade is taking place. ALADDIN looks over people's shoulders.
He sees PRINCE ACHMED riding a horse.)

PASSENGER 1: On the way to the palace, I suppose.

BYSTANDER 2: Another suitor for the princess.

(ALADDIN is surprised as the two children run out of the alley. The BOY runs in front of ACHMED's horse, startling him.)

ACHMED: Get out of my way, you brat!

(ACHMED raises his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN jumps in front of them and grabs the whip.)

ALADDIN: Hey, if I was as rich as you, I could afford some good manners!

ACHMED: Oh, I'll teach you some manners!

(ACHMED throws ALADDIN into a mud puddle. The crowd laughs at him.)

ALADDIN: Look at that, Abu. It's not every day that you see a horse with two hindquarters!

(ACHMED stops and turns towards ALADDIN.)

AHMED: Oh! You are a worthless street rat! You were born a street rat, you will die a street rat and only your fleas will cry for you.

(ALADDIN rushes at ACHMED, but the castle doors close in his face.)

ALADDIN: I am not useless. And I don't have fleas. Come on, Abu. Let's go home.

(ALADDIN rides home with the view, then returns to ABU for the night.)

ALADDIN: Riffraff, street rat. I don't buy that. If only they looked closer Would they see a poor boy? No father. They would find out, there is so much more to me.

(He pulls back a curtain to reveal the magnificent palace.) One day, Abu, things will change.
We will be rich, live in a palace and never have any problems.

(Dissolve to the same shot during the day. Cut to inside the SULTAN'S bedroom. The door swings open and PRINCE ACHMED rushes in, missing the back of his pants.)

ACHMED: I have never been so insulted.

SULTAN: Oh, Prince Ahmed. You're not leaving that early, are you?

ACHMED: Good luck marrying her.

SULTAN: Oh, Jasmine. Jasmine! Jasmine! (The SULTAN goes into the garden in search of his daughter.
He finds her, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE's pet tiger, who blocks him. RAJAH has a piece of PRINCE ACHMED's underwear in his mouth.
The SULTAN grabs the cloth and pulls it from RAJAH's mouth.) Confused, Rajah! This is why Prince Ahmed stormed off!

JASMINE: Oh, father. Rajah was just playing with him, wasn't he Rajah. (RAJAH walks over and allows JASMINE to pet him and hug him.)
You were just playing with that overdressed, self-centered Prince Ahmed, weren't you?
(She snuggles up to RAJAH, enjoying the moment, until she looks up at her angry father.) Ahem.

SULTAN: Dearest, you must stop rejecting all the suitors who come calling. The law tells you...

BOTH: …must be married to a prince.

(They head towards a dove cage.)

SULTAN: Until your next birthday.

JASMINE: The law is false.

SULTAN: You only have three days left!

JASMINE: Father, I hate having to do this. (She takes a dove out of the cage and caresses it.) If I get married, I want it to be for love.

SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not just this law. (She hands him the dove and he puts it back in the cage.)
I won't be here forever and I just want to make sure you are taken care of and provided for.

JASMINE: Please try to understand. I've never done anything on my own. (She swirls her finger in the pond water, stroking the fish.)
I never had real friends. (RAJAH looks at her and growls.) Except you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he goes back to sleep.)
I never even left the palace walls.

SULTAN: But Jasmine, you are a princess.

JASMINE: So maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore. (She splashes the water.)

SULTAN: Oooohhh! Allah forbids you from having daughters!

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second. JASMINE walks towards the doves' cage and yanks the door open. The birds fly away to freedom. She watches them leave.
Cut to int. of the SULTAN apartments.)

SULTAN: I don't know where she got that from. His mother wasn't that picky. (A shadow falls over him. He looks up in surprise and sees JAFAR.)
Uh, oh. Ah, Jafar, my most trusted advisor. I desperately need your wisdom.

JAFAR: My life is only to serve you, my lord. (He bows.)

SULTAN: It's this suitor thing. Jasmine refuses to choose a husband. I'm at the end of my tether.

IAGO: (in parrot voice) Awk! End of the roller.

SULTAN: Oh, ha, ha. Have fun, pretty Polly! (He takes a cookie out of his pocket. IAGO looks terrified. Then the SULTAN puts it in Iago's mouth.
IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it. JAFAR and the SULTAN both laugh.)

JAFAR: Your Majesty certainly has trouble with stupid animals. (IAGO looks at him.) Now perhaps I can guess a solution to this thorny problem.

SULTAN: If anyone can help, it's you.

JAFAR: Ah, but that would require the use of the Mystic Blue Diamond.

SULTAN: Uh, my ring? But it's been in the family for years.

JAFAR: We must find a suitor for the princess. (JAFAR pronounces the word "princess" with the accent on the second syllable, "cess".
He turns his cobra-headed staff towards the SULTAN. The staff's eyes begin to shine. The room darkens, JAFAR's voice slows and deepens.
SULTAN'S eyes become hypnotized.) Don't worry. Everything will be alright.

SULTAN: Everything… will… be… fine.

JAFAR: The diamond.

SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Everything you need will be fine.

(The SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns to normal as JAFAR removes the staff.)

JAFAR: You are very kind, my liege. Now run around and play with your little toys.

SULTAN: (Still hypnotized) Yes... it will be... pretty good.

(JAFAR and IAGO come out. We follow them. When they leave the room, the parrot spits out the cracker.)

IAGO: I can't take it anymore! If I have to choke on another one of those disgusting moldy crackers… bam! Beat!

(JAFAR pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.)

JAFAR: Calm down, Iago.

IAGO: Then I grabbed him by the head. Beat! Beat!

JAFAR: (speaking about IAGO.) Soon I will be sultan, not this confused idiot.

IAGO: And then I shove the crackers down his throat! Haha!

(The couple goes through a door and slams it. Diss. into the gardens outside at night. A dark figure walks through. We see it's JASMINE in disguise.
She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it. She is pulled from behind by RAJAH.)

JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here and live my life for me. I'll miss you.
(She starts climbing again and is helped by RAJAH, who starts to whine and moan.) Goodbye!

(She disappears over the wall. Cut to daylight in the street. ALADDIN and ABU start their antics again. They are on top of the awning of a fruit stand.)

ALADDIN: Okay, Abu. Go!

(ABU dives overboard and looks at the OWNER.)

OWNER: (To the passing crowd) Try this, your taste buds will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and holds on to it, distracting his attention.)
Hey, get your paws off that.

ABU: Blah blah blah!

OWNER: Well, you. Get away from here, you dirty monkey.

(He grabs the melon from ABU's hands. But in the foreground, ALADDIN bends down and snatches another melon from the stand.)

ABU: Goodbye.

(He gets up. The OWNER brings the melon to the front, where he places it on top of a pile. He looks confused, as if he had just done this.)

ALADDIN: Well done, Abu. Breakfast is served.

(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof open the melon and eat. We see JASMINE walking down the street.)

MERCHANT 1: Pretty lady, buy a pot. There is no finer pot in brass or silver.

MERCHANT 2: Sweet dates, sweet dates and figs! Sweet dates and pistachios!

MERCHANT 3: Would the lady like a necklace? A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

(She is charmed by the action, but is surprised by a fish being thrown at her face.)

MERCHANT 4: Fresh fish! We catch them, you buy them!

JASMINE: I don't think so. (She backs away, but runs into a fire eater, who is surprised to swallow her fire.) Oh, excuse me.
(He swallows, then spits fire from his mouth. JASMINE is disgusted. He is happy and pats his stomach. ALADDIN sees her, and a strange look appears on his face.) I'm really, really sorry.

ALADDIN: (He is obviously deeply in love with her.) Wow.

(She pulls the hood of her cape over her head. ABU sees this and jumps on her shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN's face.)

ABU: Uh oh. Good morning? Good morning?

(JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child looking for fruit. She picks one up and gives it to him.)

JASMINE: Oh, you must be hungry. Here is. (The boy runs away.)

OWNER: You better be able to pay for it.

JASMINE: (Mystified) Pay?

OWNER: No one is stealing my cart.

JASMINE: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I have no money.

OWNER: Thief.

JASMINE: Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the Sultan.

OWNER: Do you know what the penalty is in the event of theft?

(He takes her hand and fixes it on the table, intending to cut it.)

JASMINE: No, no, please.

(The sword falls, but his hand is stopped by that of ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Thank you, kind sir. I'm so glad you found it. I looked for you everywhere.

JASMINE: (whispering) What are you doing?

ALADDIN: (whispering back) Play along.

OWNER: Do you know this girl?

ALADDIN: Unfortunately, yes. She is my sister. She's a little crazy. (He puts his finger around her ear. She is shocked. The OWNER grabs her by the vest.)

OWNER: She said she knew the sultan.

ALADDIN: She thinks the monkey is the sultan.

(ABU picks his pockets. He hears this, then stands up. JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.)

JASMINE: Oh, wise Sultan. How can I serve you?

ABU: Well, blah blah blah blah.

ALADDIN: Tragic, isn't it? (He leans forward, picking up another apple from the cart with his foot.)
But no harm is done. (He walks towards Jasmine.) Now come, sister. It's time to see the doctor.

JASMINE: (to a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor. How are you doing?

ALADDIN: No, no, no. Not this one. (To ABU, whose pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan.

(ABU bows to the crowd and everything he stole from the cart falls out.)

OWNER: Huh? What is this? (ABU picks up what he can carry and the trio flees.) Come back here, you little thieves!

(Cut to inside the JAFAR laboratory. IAGO is spinning on a gear in a strange contraption. At the top of the contraption a storm is brewing.)

[blast]

IAGO: (huffing and puffing) With all due respect, Your Rot, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?

JAFAR: Hold your breath, Iago. Faster. (He places the SULTAN's ring in the machine.)

IAGO: Yes, O mighty Evil One. [panting]

(IAGO runs faster. A bolt of lightning passes through the ring, passing into an hourglass below. The sands begin to swirl.)

JAFAR: Gone, sands of time. Reveal to me who can enter the cave.
(The sand at the top forms the Cave of Wonders.
It falls into a storm, but it shows ALADDIN climbing a ladder, followed by JASMINE who is covered in her cape.)
Yes yes! Here it is. My diamond in the rough.

IAGO: Is that him? Is this the clown we were waiting for? (IAGO loses his footing and is sucked into the gears.)

JAFAR: Let's let the guards offer him an invitation to the palace, okay?

(IAGO walks past and hits the wall upside down.)

IAGO: Great. [cough]

(JAFAR laughs horribly, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with ALADDIN in it.
Finally, we dissolve into the real ALADDIN climbing to the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.)

[sinister laugh]

ALADDIN: I'm almost there.

(JASMINE climbs over, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms. She gets up.)

JASMINE: I want to thank you for arresting this man.

ALADDIN: Uh, forget it. (He grabs a pole.) So, uh, this is your first time at the market, huh?

(ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE: Is it so obvious?

ALADDIN: Well, you stand out rather well. (He looks at her, still in love. She returns his gaze.
But he realizes what he's doing and returns to normal.) I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be.
(He places a plank between the buildings so she can walk on it, but as he bends down, she jumps over his head. He turns around in surprise.
She throws the stick at him. ALADDIN and ABU's eyes are bulging.)

JASMINE: I learn quickly.

ALADDIN: It's true. Come on, this way. (They enter the roof of a building, avoiding boards and beams as they go.) Whoa. Watch your head there. Be careful.

JASMINE: Is this where you live?

ALADDIN: Yes. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.

JASMINE: Fabulous.

ALADDIN: Well, it's not much (he pulls back the curtain and exposes the palace) but it's a wonderful view. Palace looks really amazing, huh?

JASMINE: Oh, that's wonderful.

ALADDIN: I wonder what it would be like to live there, to have servants and servants...

JASMINE: Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.

ALADDIN: It's better than here. You always have to scratch to find food and dodge guards.

JASMINE: You are not free to make your own choices.

ALADDIN: Sometimes you feel so...

JASMINE: You're just...

BOTH: (in unison) – trapped.

(They look at each other, realizing that they are perfect for each other. But then ALADDIN realizes where he is and breaks the gaze.
He takes the apple from ABU's hand and rolls it down his arm into JASMINE's hand.)

ALADDIN: So, uh, where are you from?

JASMINE: What does it matter? I ran away and I won't come back.

ALADDIN: Really? How come? (He takes a bite of the apple in his hand, then hands it to ABU, who looks disgusted.)

ABU: Why are you...!

(ALADDIN approaches and sits next to JASMINE.)

JASMINE: My father is forcing me to get married.

ALADDIN: It's--it's horrible. (ABU appears behind the princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!

(ABU runs to a higher point, chattering and swearing as he goes.)

JASMIN: What?

ALADDIN: Abu says... uh... it's not fair.

ABU: What?

JASMINE: Oh, right?

ALADDIN: Yeah, sure.

JASMINE: And does Abu have anything else to say?

ALADDIN: Well, uh, he wishes he could do something to help her.

ABU: Oh, boy!

JASMINE: Hmm... tell him that's very... nice.

(ALADDIN and JASMINE get closer and closer, until ALADDIN leans in to kiss her. He is interrupted, however, by the GUARDS, who found them.)

GUARD: There you are!

ALADDIN and JASMINE: They are after me! (to each other) Are they after you?

JASMINE: My father must have sent them...

ALADDIN: Do you trust me?

JASMIN: What?

ALADDIN: Do you trust me? (He holds out his hand)

JASMIN: Yes. (She takes it.)

ALADDIN: Then jump!

(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt. They try to escape, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)

GUARD: We keep bumping into each other, don't we, street rat?

(Again, the guard's turban is shot down by ABU, but other guards are there and blocking the exit.
The first GUARD rips ABU off his head and throws him into a vase. Three more GUARDS catch ALADDIN.)
-
GUARD: This is the dungeon for you, boy.

ALADDIN: Hey, let me go!

JASMINE: Let him go.

GUARD: (not realizing she's the princess) Look what we have here, men: a street mouse. (He throws her to the ground.)

JASMINE: (getting up and removing the hood of her coat) Let him go, by order of the princess!

(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.)

GUARD: Princess Jasmine.

ALADDIN: The princess?

ABU: (looking from the vase) The princess?

GUARD: What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat?

JASMINE: It's not your problem. Do as I command. Free him!

GUARD: Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from Jafar. You will need to discuss this with him.

(The GUARDS drag ALADDIN outside, bowing.)

JASMINE: (having a very tired look) Believe me, I will.

(Cut to inside the palace, JAFAR coming out of his secret apartments.
He closes the door carefully, but the princess rushes in before he finishes. He closes it, trapping IAGO inside the door frame.)

JASMINE: Jafar?

JAFAR: Oh, uh, princess.

IAGO: Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck!

JAFAR: How can I be of help to you? (He spreads his cloak, hiding the door.)

JASMINE: The guards just took a boy to the market, on your orders.

JAFAR: Your father charged me with keeping the peace in Agrabah. The boy was a criminal.

JASMINE: What was the crime?

IAGO: I can't breathe, Jafar.

JAFAR: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.

IAGO: If you could just... (JAFAR pushes him back inside the door and it closes) - wow, that hurts!

JASMINE: He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!

JAFAR: (walking away as if shocked) Oh, my God! Oh, how terribly upsetting. If I had known.

JASMINE: What do you mean?

JAFAR: Unfortunately, the boy's sentence has already been served.

JASMINE: What sentence?

JAFAR: (in a sinister tone) Death. (JASMINE gasps.) By decapitating.

JASMIN: No! (She collapses to the ground.)

JAFAR: I am extremely sorry, princess.

JASMINE: How could you? (She runs out of the room crying.)

(IAGO finally manages to get through the door. He flies away and lands on JAFAR's shoulder, coughing.)

IAGO: So how did it go?

JAFAR: I think she took it... pretty well. (They both have a sinister smile on their faces.)

(Speech to JASMINE at night, who is crying by the fountain. RAJAH comes to comfort her. She caresses him.)

JASMINE: It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't even know his name.

(Cut to inside the dungeon. Rats scurry and we go down until we see ALADDIN chained to the wall.)

ALADDIN: (to himself) She was the princess. I can not believe it. I must have seemed so stupid to him!

ABU: (from a distance) Yoo-hoo! Aladdin? Good morning!

(ABU appears at the window at the top of the dungeon.)

ALADDIN: Abu! Here! Hey, come on, help me out of this.

(ABU stops, then starts chattering wildly, falling to the ground. He wraps a cloth around his head and makes big eyes to imitate the princess.)

ALADDIN: Hey, she was in trouble. Ah, she was worth it.

(ABU jumps onto ALADDIN's shoulders and takes a small set of tools from his pocket, then releases ALADDIN.)

ABU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

ALADDIN: Don't worry, Abou. I will never see her again. I'm a street rat, remember, and there's a law. She must marry a prince. She deserves a prince.

(ABU finally releases ALADDIN's hands.)

ABU: Ta-da!

ALADDIN: (rubbing his wrists) I'm a... I'm an imbecile.

OLD MAN: You're just a fool if you give up, boy.

(We see an old man sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU have seen before.)

ALADDIN: Who are you?

THE OLD MAN: A humble prisoner like you. But together, maybe we can be more.

ALADDIN: I'm listening.

OLD MAN: There is a cave, my boy... a cave of wonders, filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams. Enough treasure to impress even your princess, I'd wager.

(Listeners will notice that the OLD MAN pronounced the word "princess" as "prin-CESS" rather than the standard pronunciation of "PRIN-cess."
The OLD MAN turns his back on him and IAGO pokes his head out of JAFAR's "old man" disguise.)

IAGO: Jafar, can you hurry up? I die here. [calling out]

ALADDIN: But the law says that only a prince can...

THE OLD MAN: You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you? Whoever owns the gold makes the rules. (He smiles, showing a horribly bad mouth.) [wheezing laughter]

ALADDIN: Then why would you share all this wonderful treasure with me?

OLD MAN: I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to chase him.

ALADDIN: Uh, a problem. It is over there. We are here.

(The OLD MAN walks towards a wall and pushes a hidden exit.)

OLD MAN: Mm-mm-mm. Things are not always what they seem. So… do we have a deal?

(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs his shoulders.)

ABU: Oh, I don't know.

(Cut to a desert scene. We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the OLD MAN and ABU on it. Diss. at the Cave of Wonders.)

[thunder crashes]

CAVE: Who disturbs my sleep?

ALADDIN: Uh, it's me, Aladdin.

CAVE: Continue. Do not touch anything except the lamp.

(The cave opens with a roar and a staircase appears in front of ALADDIN.)

THE OLD MAN: Remember, my boy, go and get me the lamp first, and then you will have your reward.

ALADDIN: Come on, Abu. (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of his jacket.)

[squeaking]

(ALADDIN begins to descend the stairs. He reaches the bottom and enters a golden chamber filled with treasures.)

ALADDIN: Would you like to watch that?

ABU: [moaning] Uh oh.

ALADDIN: Just a handful of these things would make me richer than the Sultan.

(ABU takes a look, sees the treasure, then rushes towards it.)

ALADDIN: Abu.

[moans]

(ABU stops mid-run, hovering over a mat on the floor.)

ALADDIN: Don’t touch anything. We need to find this lamp.

(They begin to make their way across the room when the CARPET rises from the floor and begins to follow them. ABU has the feeling that they are being followed.)

ABU: Huh?

(He turns around and the CARPET lies flat on the ground. He continues and the CARPET starts to follow again.
Again, ABU turns around, but the CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasures. ABU runs towards ALADDIN and pulls his pant leg.)

ABU: Aladdin, Aladdin.

ALADDIN: Abu, will you stop him?

(Again, the MAT follows, but this time, when ABU turns around, the rug jumps to the other side.
He comes down with a pompom and pulls ABU's tail. When ABU jumps, CARPET jumps to the other side again.
This time ABU lands in a karate stance. CARPET bends down and snatches ABU's hat, then puts it on himself.
ABU thought for a second, until CARPET waved an acorn in his face. ABU and CARPET both jump in fright and run away.
ABU tackles ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)

[screams]

ALADDIN: Abu, what are you, madman?

(The CARPET appears behind a pile of treasures.)

ALADDIN: A magic carpet. Come on. To go out. I'm not going to hurt you.

(The CARP comes out slowly, timidly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts it. He flies towards ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to him.
ABU screams and jumps on ALADDIN's shoulder.)

[screams]

ALADDIN: Hey, take it easy, Abu. He's not going to bite. THANKS.

(CARPET picks up ABU's hat again and hands it to him. ABU clenches his fist and shouts at it. CARPET begins to walk away, "sadly.")

[squeaking]

ALADDIN: Hey. Wait a minute. Do not go. Maybe you can help us. (CARPET looks back, excited. It then flies over and wraps itself around the couple.)
Hey, whoa. You see, we are trying to find this lamp. (CARPET motions for them to follow him.) I think he knows where he is.

ABU: [squeals excitedly] [echoes]

(They pass through a long cave, until they emerge into a giant underground cavern. In the center of the room is a large pillar, with a staircase leading up to it.
It is surrounded by water with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge. At the top of the pillar is a beam of light. ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)

ALADDIN: [whispers] Wait here.

ABU: [moaning] Oh. Eh? Oh!

(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey. The outstretched paws hold a giant ruby. ABU is drawn to it hypnotically. ALADDIN quickly runs up the stairs.
CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail, trying in vain to hold him back. ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN: Is that it? This is why we came here... (He looks down and sees ABU freeing himself from CARPET's grip and rushing towards the jewel.)
Abu! NOW!

(ABU grabs the jewel. There is a rumble and the room begins to shake.)

VOICES FROM THE CAVES: Infidels!

ABU: Uh oh.

VOICE FROM THE CAVE: You have touched the forbidden treasure! (ABU puts the jewel back in the paw, but the jewel and shrine melt into lava.)
From now on, you will never see the light of day again!

ALADDIN: Wow!

(ALADDIN runs down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he goes down until he flies into the air. The water has turned into lava.
He falls towards her, when suddenly CARPET appears and catches him. ABU is standing on one of the rocks on the bridge.
He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava. Then CARPET rushes and ALADDIN catches him, just as the last rock explodes.)

ABU: Help, help, help!

ALADDIN: I got you! Whoa, Carpet, let's move!

(Together they run through the caves avoiding walls and falling debris. ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.)

ALADDIN: Abu! Abu, now is not the time to panic! (He pulls ABU out of his head and sees that they are flying into a wall.) Start panicking!

[Abu panting] [thunder cracks] [roaring]

(CARPET dives, then passes through another cave. Eventually, they emerge through the inner entrance. Outside, the cave begins to groan and close.
CARPET and company are almost at the top when a rock falls onto the mat, with a clip of THX Optimizer, sending him to the floor.
ALADDIN grabs onto the rock wall and hangs on. He sees the OLD MAN at the top, within his reach.)

ALADDIN: Help me!

OLD MAN: Throw me the lamp!

ALADDIN: I can't hold on. Give me your hand!

OLD MAN: Give me the lamp first!

(ALADDIN reaches out and takes out the MAGIC LAMP. He holds it out and the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)

OLD MAN: [laughing] Yes! Finally! [puts on the lamp]

[Aladdin struggles]

(ALADDIN gets out with ABU's help. But the OLD MAN pushes ABU away and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.)

ALADDIN: What are you doing?

OLD MAN: I'll give you your reward! (JAFAR resumes his normal voice.) Your eternal reward. [yelling]

(He takes out a twisted dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when ABU bites him on the wrist. He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN, who falls into the cave.
THE OLD MAN also throws ABU into the cave. The clip ends from THX Optimizer, falling. CARPET sees him, but is stuck under a rock.
He struggles to free himself, then he does. He rushes and catches up with ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several times and is unconscious.
On the surface, the cave roars one last time, then sinks again into the sand. JAFAR takes off his disguise.) [screaming]

[roar]

JAFAR: It's mine! It's all mine! I-- (He can't find it in his pocket) Where is it? No! No...!

(The kiss disappears in JASMINE's room. She is sitting on her bed, next to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN enters.)

SULTAN: Jasmine? Oh my dear. What's wrong?

JASMINE: Jafar… did… something… terrible. (She looks like she's crying.)

SULTAN: There, there, there, my child, we will make things right. Now tell me everything.

(Cut to inside the cave. ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET. ABU tries to wake him up.)

ABU: Oh, oh. Aladdin? Wake up. Aladdin.

(TAPIT gets up, lifting ALADDIN. He wakes up slowly.)

ALADDIN: Oh, my head. (He looks at the sealed entrance.) We're stuck. (Angry, clenching his fists at the entrance) That two-faced son of a jackal!
(Calmer) Whoever he is, he's long gone with that lamp.

ABU: Aha!

(ABU takes out the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN: Hey! Well, you little hairy thief! It looks like dilapidated, worthless scrap metal.
Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to understand.

(He rubs the LAMP. Suddenly, smoke comes out of the hole, the LAMP begins to shake and shine, but ALADDIN clings to the LAMP, and our wonderful friend,
the GENIUS comes out.)

GENIE: Aaaaahhhhh! Oi! Ten thousand years will be such a pain in your neck! (He hangs ALADDIN on a nearby rock.
Then he tears off his head and spins it around, screaming. CARPET knocks down an ALADDIN.)
Wow! Does it feel good to be outside! (GENIE uses the end of his lamp as a microphone.)
Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hi, where are you from? (He puts the microphone in front of ALADDIN's face.) What is your name?

ALADDIN: Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.

GENIE: (Pronounces his name as if he had discovered something important) Aladdin! (A neon sign lights up with ALADDIN's name on it, surrounded by chase lights.
The sign changes to reflect the GENIE's next line.) Hello, Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Can we call you “Al?” » Or maybe just “Din?” »
Or how about “Laddi?” » (GENIE disappears, then a dog wrapped in a blanket enters.) They would say “Here, my boy! Come on, Laddi!

ALADDIN: (shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder than I thought.

GENIE: (Still a dog) Do you smoke? Do you mind if I do? (The dog poops in the smoke, then returns to the GENIE. ABU howls wildly.)
Oh, sorry Cheetah, I hope I didn't burn the fur! Yo, Rugman! I haven't seen you in a few millennia! Give me a pompom!
Yo! Yeah! (THE CARPET flies over and greets the GENIUS. THE GENIUS looks at ALADDIN.) Say, you are much smaller than my last master.
(He lifts his beer belly.) Either that or I get fat. Look at me from the side: do I seem different to you?

ALADDIN: Wait a minute! I am... your master?

GENIE: (Puts a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a mortar on his head.) It's true! We can teach him!!
What would you like from me, (like Arnold Schwarzenegger) the always impressive, (inside a cube) the long content, (like a ventriloquist with a dummy)
often imitated, (throws the mannequin aside) but never duplicated-- (He multiplies into several GENIES that surround him.) DUP.

GENIES: Duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated.

GENIUS: (He says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.) Genie of the lamp! (He enters Ed Sullivan) Right here, straight from the lamp,
right here for your enjoyment and fulfillment of your wishes. THANKS!

ALADDIN: Wow! Wish fulfillment?

GENIUS: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-no about wishing for more wishes. (Transforms into a slot machine, the arm lowers and three Genies appear in the windows.)
That's it: three. (Three GENIE caballeros come out of the slot.) Uno, dos, tres. (Changes to b/w Groucho Marx.) No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.
(The duck falls with the secret word “Refunds”.

ALADDIN: (TO ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming.

Genie: Master, I don't think you really realize what you have here! So why not just ruminate while I illuminate the possibilities.
[Genius]
Well, Ali Baba had forty thieves
Scheherazadie had a thousand stories
But control yourself with luck because you have your work cut out for you
You have a brand of magic that never fails!
(GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords. GENIUS appears in his vest, then extends his arms and subdues the thieves.)

[Genius]
You have power in your corner now
Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got punch, spice, Yahoo and how
See, all you have to do is rub this lamp
And I will say
(The boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, massaged by the GENIUS. Then the GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and explodes and shoots one of our heroes.
Then GENIUS appears inside the lamp and grabs ALADDIN's hand and rubs the lamp with it.)

[Genius]
Mister Aladdin sir
What will be your pleasure?
Let me take your order, write it down
You never had a friend like me
No no no!
(GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes things down on a notepad, like a waiter.)

[Genius]
Life is your restaurant And I am your master!
Come on, whisper what you want
You've never had a friend like me.
(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal, but widens his ear to listen to ALADDIN. Eventually he explodes into four duplicate GENIES.)

[Genius]
Yes sir, we pride ourselves on our service
You are the boss, the king, the shah!
Say what you want, it's yours!
Real Dish How about a little more Baklava?
(The Genies give him a shave, a haircut and a manicure, then ALADDIN appears in a comfortable armchair (eh?) surrounded by the treasure and fanned by women.
The GENIUS appears and fills the screen with baklava.)

[Genius]
Try a bit of column “A”
Try the whole column “B”
I'm in the mood to help you man
You never had a friend like me
(ALADDIN climbs onto a column of food with a giant A at the top, then jumps onto another column with a B at the top.
He falls and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE. He opens his mouth and his tongue turns into a staircase.
A miniature GENIUS dressed like a magician comes out. The mini GENIE does a little dance with the two giant Genie hands.
In the end, they surround the mini GENIE and crush him.)

[Genius]
Can your friends do this?
Do your friends do this?
Do your friends pull this out of their little hat?
Can your friends go poof!
Well look here
Can your friends go Abracadabra, let them rip
And then make this bastard disappear?
(The GENIUS tears off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them.
He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins one of the heads on the tip of his finger like a basketball.
He throws the heads at the GENIUS, who tries to pull himself out of a hat at his base.
He goes around in circles until he turns into a white rabbit. The rabbit transforms into a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center).
The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS, who dance around ALADDIN. The moment he starts enjoying them, they disappear.)

[Genius]
So don't just sit there, slack-jawed, blank-eyed
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me in good faith, certified
Do you have a genius in charge? business!
I have a strong desire to help you
So what you want, I really want to know
You have a wish that's three miles long, without a doubt
So all you have to do is rub like this, and oh!
(GENIE imitates what he calls ALADDIN, then transforms into a certificate that rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.
THE GENIUS takes a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses to rub his buttocks as if to dry himself after a shower.)

[Genius]
Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three
I'm at work, big mogul
You never had a friend, you never had a friend
You never had a friend, you never had a friend
You've never... had a friend... like... me!
You've never had a friend like me!
(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans over to kiss one. She transforms into GENIUS, who brings four dancing elephants into existence.
In the other direction, he zaps four dancing camels, and a big final dance number ensues, along with our heroes dancing as well.
ABU collects as much gold as he can, but the GENIE envelops it all in a cyclone and erases it until they are all back in the cave.
GENIE has a neon “APPLAUSE” sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and sees that it is empty.)

GENIE: So what's it going to be, master?

ALADDIN: Are you going to grant me the three wishes I want?

GENIE: (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost. There are some reservations, some considerations

ALADDIN: Like?

GENIE: Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anyone. (He cuts off her head with his finger.) So don't ask.
Second rule: I can't make someone fall in love with someone else. (The head turns into a big pair of lips kissing ALADDIN.)
You little punishment there. (Lies flat, then gets up and turns into a zombie.) Third rule: I can't raise people from the dead.
It's not a pretty picture, (He grabs ALADDIN and shakes him) I don't like doing that! (He returns to normal.) Other than that, you have it!

ALADDIN: (looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, reservations? Do you mean the limits? On wishes?
(To ABU) Some all-powerful geniuses can't even bring people back to life. I don't know, Abu. He probably won't even be able to get us out of this cave.
Looks like we're going to have to find a way out of here...

(They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps in front of them.)

GENIE: Excuse me? Are you looking at me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up, bring me here? And all of a sudden you let me down?
(Becomes angrier and angrier) I don't think so, not at the moment. You get your wishes, so sit back!
(They all get on CARPET. GENIE takes the form of a flight attendant, with many arms pointing to the exits.)
In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, anywhere!
Keep your hands and arms inside the mat. Weeee’rrrrreee… out of here..

(The CARPET and passengers fly out of the desert sand and into the distance. Cut to inside the Sultan's room.
JAFAR is there with IAGO, JASMINE and the SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Jafar, this is a scandal. If it weren't for all your years of good and loyal service...
From now on, you must discuss with me the sentencing of the prisoners, before they are beheaded.

JAFAR: I assure you, Your Highness, this will not happen again.

SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, now let's leave this whole complicated matter behind us. Please?

JAFAR: My most abject and humble apologies, princess. (He takes her hand to kiss it, but she pulls it away.)

JASMINE: At least there will be some good if I am forced to marry. When I'm queen, I'll have the power to get rid of you.

SULTAN: That's nice. So everything was settled. Now, Jasmine, back to this suitor thing, (he looks and sees Jasmine coming out)
Jasmine? Jasmine! (He runs after her.)

JAFAR: If only I had that lamp!

IAGO: (as JASMINE) I will have the power to get rid of you! Oh!
To think we have to keep kissing this idiot and his idiot daughter for the rest of our lives...

JAFAR: No, Iago. Only until she finds an idiot husband. Then she will have us banished... or beheaded!

BOTH: Eeewww!

IAGO: (has an idea) Oh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Jafar? What if you were the idiot husband?

JAFAR: (He looks at IAGO insultingly) What?

IAGO: Okay, you marry the princess, okay? So, uh, you become sultan!

JAFAR: Ah! Marry the shrew? I become sultan. The idea has merit!

IAGO: Yes, deserve it! Yes! And then we drop the step-dad and the little wife off a cliff! (Plunge the bombs into the ground) Kersplat!

JAFAR: Iago, I love the way your dirty little mind works!

(Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where CARPET arrives to land.)

GENIE: (Still as flight attendant) Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet for all your travel needs. Do not stand until the treadmill has completely stopped.
(As ALADDIN and ABU descend the staircase formed by CARPET) Thank you. Goodbye goodbye ! THANKS! Bye! (Back to normal)
Good now. And that, Mr. Mustafa who doubts?

ALADDIN: Oh, you showed me that well. Now about my three wishes-

GENIUS: Are my ears deceiving me? Three? You're down ONE, boy!

ALADDIN: Ah, no, I never really wanted to leave the cave. You did it alone.

(GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops. He turns into a sheep.)

GENIE: Well, don't I just feel sheepish? Fine, you baaaaad boy, but no more presents.

ALADDIN: Fair deal. So three wishes. I want them to be good. (TO GENIE) What do you want?

(GENIE hangs like a hammock between two trees.)

GENIE: Me? No one has ever asked me that before. Well, in my case, ah, forget it.

ALADDIN: What? No tell me.

GENIUS: Freedom.

ALADDIN: Are you a prisoner?

GENIUS: It's all an integral part, the whole concert of genius. (Becomes gigantic, voice resonates) Phenomenal cosmic powers!
(Shrinks, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.) Tiny living space

ALADDIN: Genius, it's terrible.

GENIE: (Exits the LAMP) But, oh... to be free. No need to say "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?"
To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and treasures in the world! But what am I talking about here?
Let's be real here. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. Genius, wake up and smell the hummus.

ALADDIN: Why not?

GENIE: The only way I can get out of this is if my master wants me to leave. So you can guess how often this happened.

ALADDIN: I will. I will free you.

GENIE: (Head transforms into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Um, that's right. Shout!

ALADDIN: No, really, I promise. (He pushes the nose back and Genie's head returns to normal.)
After I make my first two wishes, I will use my third wish to free you. (He holds out his hand)

GENIE: Well, I hope so. (He shakes ALADDIN's hand.) Very good. Let's make magic. (He transforms into a magician.) So, what about it? What do you want most?

ALADDIN: Well, there's this girl.

GENIUS: Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and Genie's chest shows a heart with a cross through it.) False. I can't make someone fall in love, remember?

ALADDIN: Oh, but, Genie, she's smart and funny and...

GENIUS: Pretty?

ALADDIN: Magnificent. She has these eyes that… and this hair. Wow. And his smile… [sigh]

GENIUS: (Sitting in a Parisian café with ABU and CARPET.) Friend. It's love.

ALADDIN: But she's the princess. To have a chance, I would have to be... Hey, can you make me a prince?

GENIE: Let's see here. (Has a “Royal Cookbook.”) Chicken a la king? (He takes out a chicken with a crown on its head) No. Alaskan king crab.
(He removes his finger and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from "The Little Mermaid" squeezed.) Ouch. I hate it when they do that. Caesar salad? Ah!
(A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et Tu, Brute? No. Aha. “Make a prince.” (He looks at ALADDIN with a sly look.) Is this an official wish? Say the words.

ALADDIN: Genie, I wish you would make me a prince!

GENIE: Very good! Woof woof woof woof! (Gains square shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes a tailor/fashion designer.)
Firstly, this fez and waistcoat combination is way too third century. These patches – what are we trying to say – begging? No! Let's work with me here.
(He takes Aladdin's measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN puts on his prince costume.) I like that, muy macho! Now I still need something.
What does that tell me? It's about mode of transportation. Excuse me, monkey boy! Aqui, this way!

(ABU tries to cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and he flies over.)

ABU: Uh oh!

GENIE: Here he comes (ALADDIN and GENIE are on the set of a game show, where ALADDIN is standing behind a podium with "AL" on it.)
And what better way to make your grand entrance onto the streets of Agrabah than by riding your very own brand new camel!
Be careful, it spits! (A door bearing the Genie's head opens, where ABU transforms into a camel. He spits out the side of his mouth on cue.
But Genie isn't sure.) Mmm, not enough. (He snaps his fingers and ABU transforms into a fancy white horse.) It's still not enough. Let's see. What do you need?
(The GENIUS snaps his fingers repeatedly, transforming ABU into: a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57 Cadillac, with the license plate "ABU 1."
(It's a guess, I don't know the cars, but judging by the tail fins, didn't say. Eventually it came back to normal.)
Yes!! Esalalumbo, Shimin Dumbo! Wow!! (And on the key word of the spell, Dumbo, ABU transforms into an elephant.
CARPET struggles to get out of ABU's size (46 feet.) Talk about trunk space, look at this action!

(ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree.
The tree naturally leans down to the ground, where ABU clings and looks upside down at ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Abu, you look good.

GENIUS: He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant, but we're not done yet. Hold on to your turban, kid, because we're going to make you a star!

(We slowly zoom out to the oasis in the distance, as fireworks begin to explode outward. Cut to a pile of toys. (Look for the BEAST here.)
We bow and see the SULTAN balancing them. He carefully balances the last piece on top, then sits back and sighs.
However, JAFAR bursts in and the stack collapses.)

JAFAR: Sire, I have found a solution to your daughter's problem.

IAGO: Awk! The problem with your daughter!

SULTAN: Oh, really?

JAFAR: (unrolling a scroll) Right here. “If the princess has not chosen a husband at the appointed time, then the sultan will choose for her.”

SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all these suitors! (He tries to put a biscuit in Iago's mouth. IAGO steps back. The SULTAN absently removes the biscuit.)
How could I choose someone she hates? (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly puts a cracker in his mouth.)

JAFAR: Do not worry, my lord. There is more. If, in the event that a suitable prince cannot be found, then a princess must be married to… hmm… interesting.

SULTAN: What? WHO?

JAFAR: The royal vizier! Well, that would be… me!

SULTAN: Well, I thought the law said only a prince can marry a princess, I'm quite sure of that.

JAFAR: Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord. (He takes out the stick and hypnotizes the SULTAN with it.)

SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...

JAFAR: You will order the princess to marry me.

SULTAN: I... will order... the princess... to... (the spell breaks momentarily)... but you are so old!

JAFAR: (holds the stick closer) The princess is going to marry me!

SULTAN: The princess will marry... (the spell is broken again, this time by the fanfare of "Prince Ali's" trumpets.)
What? What is this? This music! Hahaha. Jafar, you have to come see this!

(We see a parade moving forward, led by what appears to be the GENIUS in human form as MAJOR.)

WALKERS: Make way for Prince Ali!

SWORDSMEN: Say hello! It's Prince Ali!

MAJOR: Hey, lead the way in the old bazaar, Hey you, let us pass, it's a bright new star, Oh, come, be the first in your neighborhood to catch his eye!
Make way, here it is, Ring the bells, strike the drums. You will love this guy

(The MAJOR mixes with the different members of the crowd.) Prince Ali, fabulous him, Ali Ababwa! Genuflect, show some respect On your knees

(ABU the elephant crosses the city, with ALADDIN (ALI) on its back.)
Now do your best to stay calm. Brush up on your Sunday Salaam and come meet its spectacular coterie.

(IAGO dances to the music until JAFAR looks at him. MAJOR "wheelbarrows" six men onto ABU's trunk.
They stand on each other's shoulders while ALI shakes hands.) Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa! Strong as ten ordinary men, definitely
He faced the galloping hordes A hundred villains with swords Who sent these fools to their lords, why Prince Ali!

(The stack collapses on ALI, but a GENIE(TM) lightning bolt zaps the stack and he ends up keeping them all in acrobatic cartwheel formation.
The GENIUS transforms into an old man, then a child and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.)

MEN'S CHORUS: (carrying the camels) He has 75 golden camels!

(In pops, a typical parade commentator)

HARRY: Aren't they lovely, June?

WOMEN'S CHOIR: (On a float) Purple peacocks, there are 53 of them!

(Another commentator arrives.)

JUNE: (Mary Hart voice) Fabulous, Harry. I love feathers.

GENIE: (GENIE is off-screen, a giant balloon monkey walks down the parade)
When it comes to exotic type mammals, does he have a zoo, I tell you, it's a world class menagerie!

(GENIE appears in the form of a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two lines to the two children from earlier.
We move to a balcony, where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.)

GENIUS: (with the voice of ETHEL MERMAN)

GIRLS: (in counterpoint, hearts beating)

Prince Ali, he is handsome Ali Ababwa There is no doubt that this Ali is attractive
This physique, how can I speak Never ordinary, never boring Weak in the knee
Everything about this man simply impresses. Well, get out there. He's a marvel, he's a genius, a marvel. Adjust your sail and get ready.
He's about to break my heart To gape and crawl and watch Prince Ali! And I love the way he dresses!

(JASMINE looks from the palace balcony. She sighs.)

CHORUS: He has 95 white Persian monkeys!

(He has the monkeys, let's see the monkeys!)

And to view them, it doesn't charge any fees!

(He is generous, so generous)

He has slaves, he has servants and minions!

(Proud to work for him)

They bow to his whims, love to serve him

They just suck when it comes to loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!

(ALADDIN throws gold coins at the people, who rush to collect them. ABU, ALADDIN and the procession go up the steps of the palace and inside.
The SULTAN runs back to the throne room door, but JAFAR stands in front of the door.
Suddenly, it opens, with ABU and ALADDIN leading, and crushing JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)

CHORUS and GENIUS: Prince Ali, In love with him! Ali Ababwa!

GENIE: I hear your princess is a lovely sight to behold!

And that is why, good people,

He got dressed and went

CHORUS: With 60 elephants, llamas galore

With its bears and its lions

A marching band and more

With its 40 fakirs, its cooks, its bakers

His birds chirping on the sidelines

Make way for Prince Ali!

(More and more fanfare builds until ALADDIN flies off on ABU's back on MAGIC CARPET and flies towards the SULTAN. JAFAR slams the door.)

SULTAN: (clapping) Splendid, absolutely wonderful.

ALADDIN: (takes a deeper voice.) Ahem. Your Majesty, I have come from far away to seek your daughter's hand.

SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa! Of course. Nice to meet you. (He rushes over and shakes ALI's hand.) This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He is delighted too.

JAFAR: (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic. I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...

ALADDIN: --Ababwa!

JAFAR: It doesn't matter. RIGHT. You can't just scroll here uninvited and expect...

SULTAN: ...by Allah, this is a truly remarkable device. (He pulls on the pom poms, and they pull on his mustache.) I don't think I could...

ALADDIN: Well, certainly, your majesty. Allow me.

(He helps SULTAN onto the CARPET, and he drops down. JAFAR pins the CARPET to the ground with the stick.)

JAFAR: Sire, I must advise you against that...

SULTAN: --Oh, button up, Jafar. Learn to have a little fun.

(He kicks the stick and CARPET and SULTAN fly away. IAGO, who was standing on the head of the stick, falls,
repeatedly hitting the stick with its beak as it descends.
SULTAN and CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then launch a dive bomb attack, flying under ABU, scaring him.
The flight continues in the background, while JAFAR and ALI chat in the foreground.)

JAFAR: Where did you say you were from?

ALADDIN: Oh, much further than you have traveled, I'm sure. (He smiles. JAFAR does not.)

JAFAR: Try me. (Iago lands on the stick.)

SULTAN: Watch out, Polly!

(They all duck in time as the CARPET whistles a few inches above their heads. THE CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.)

IAGO: Hey, look at this. Look at him with that stupid rug!

(The CARPET zooms below IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow and crashes against a pillar.
He crashes to the ground and his head is surrounded by miniature SULTANS on CARPETs, saying "Have a cracker, have a cracker".
The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)

SULTAN: Away, I'm coming to land. Jafar, look at this! (It lands.)

JAFAR: Spectacular, Your Highness.

SULTAN: Ooh, lovely. Yes, I seem to have a gift for that. (CARPET walks towards ABU dizzy, then collapses. ABU catches him.)
This is a very impressive youth. And a prince too. (Whispers to JAFAR) If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all.

JAFAR: I don't trust him, Sire.

SULTAN: This is absurd. One thing I'm proud of, Jafar, is that I'm an excellent judge of character.

IAGO: Oh, excellent judge, yeah, of course… no!!!

(JASMINE enters quietly.)

SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one!

ALADDIN: And I'm pretty sure I'll love Princess Jasmine!

JAFAR: Your Highness, no. I must intercede on behalf of Jasmine. (JASMINE hears this and gets angry.) This boy is no different from the others.
What makes him think he is worthy of the princess?

ALADDIN: Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pricks JAFAR's goatee which shoots out in all directions.)
Just let her meet me. I will win your daughter!

JASMINE: How dare you! (They all look at her in surprise.) All of you, here, deciding my future? I am not a prize to be won! (She storms out.)

SULTAN: Oh, my God. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just give Jasmine time to calm down. (They go out.)

JAFAR: I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince Abooboo.

(Speech to JASMINE on her balcony at night. We bow and find ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)

ALADDIN: What am I going to do? Jasmine won't even let me talk to her. I should have known I couldn't make this stupid prince wish come true.
(ABU struggles with his bellbottoms to open a banana. He crushes it and the banana flies into his eyes.
He then throws the banana peel into a pile of the same.)

GENIE: (on the mat, playing chess) So get moving! (CARPET does so, knocking a black piece off the board.) Hey. It's a good decision. (As Rodney Dangerfield)
I can't believe it, I'm losing to an all-in.

ALADDIN: Genius, I need help.

GENIE: (as Jack Nicholson) All right, Sparky, here's the deal. You want to woo the little lady, you have to be a fair shooter, are you following me?

ALADDIN: What?

GENIE: (Returning to normal, carrying a mortar. He shows his words on a blackboard) Tell him the... TRUTH!!!

ALADDIN: No way! If Jasmine found out I was really a dirty street rat, she would make fun of me. (He puts on his turban which lights up like the GENIUS.)

GENIUS: A woman appreciates a man who knows how to make her laugh! (ALADDIN pulls the chain and turns off the light. THE GENIUS comes out holding the real turban.)
Al, joking aside, you really should be yourself.

ALADDIN: Hey, that's the last thing I want to be. Okay, I'll go see her. I have to be gentle, cool, confident. What do I look like?

GENIE: (Unfortunately) Like a prince.

(ALADDIN flies to the balcony on TAPIS. JASMINE is on her bed, sighing. RAJAH is by her side.)

ALADDIN: (From afar) Princess Jasmine?

(RAJAH looks up and groans.)

JASMINE: Who is there?

ALADDIN: It's me, Prince Ali. Ahem--(Then he jumps into his deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.

JASMINE: I don't want to see you.

ALADDIN: No, no, please, princess. Give me a chance.

(RAJAH growls and walks towards him.)

JASMINE: Leave me alone.

ALADDIN: Down with kitty!

(Across the balcony, CARPET looks down with GENIE below.)

GENIE: So, how's our little friend?

(CARPET cuts his neck with her finger.)

ALADDIN: Come on, good kitty, take off and go. Kitten down. (He removes his turban to push RAJAH away.)

JASMINE: (She looks at him, thinking how she's seen him before.) Wait, wait. I know you?

ALADDIN: (quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no.

JASMINE: You remind me of someone I met in the market.

ALADDIN: The market? (A bee buzzes around his head.) I have servants who go to the market for me.
Why I even have servants who go to the market for my servants, so it can't be me you met.

JASMINE: (looks disappointed) No, I guess not.

BEE: (It's the GENIUS) Enough about you, Casanova. Talk about her! She's smart, funny, the hair, the eyes. Anything: choose a feature!

ALADDIN: Uh, Princess Jasmine? You are very…

BEE: Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!

ALADDIN: Punctual!

JASMINE: Punctual?

BEE: Sorry.

ALADDIN: Magnificent.

BEE: Great recovery.

JASMINE: Hmm. I'm rich too, you know.

ALADDIN: Yeah!

JASMINE: Daughter of a sultan.

ALADDIN: I know.

JASMINE: A great price for any prince to marry.

ALADDIN: Um, that's true. RIGHT. A prince like me.

BEE: (buzzing in his ear) Watch out! Warning!

JASMINE: That's right, a prince like you. And every other fluffy, swaggering, peacock shirt I've come across!

BEE: (Back on fire, wearing glasses and crashing) Mayday! Help!

JASMINE: Go jump off the balcony! (She turns around and walks away)

ALADDIN: What?

BEE: Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to poke her?

ALADDIN: (He hits the bee) Get out!

BEE: Okay, great. But remember: be yourself! (BEE buzzes in his turban)

ALADDIN: Yeah, that's true!

JASMIN: What!?

ALADDIN: Um, you're right. You're not just a prize to be won (He looks disappointed.)
You should be free to make your own choice. JASMINE and RAJAH look at each other in confusion.) I'm going to go now. (He climbs onto the ledge and goes down.)

JASMIN: No!

ALADDIN: (raises his head over the edge) What? What?

JASMINE: (Now she's surprised) How--how do you do that? (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.)

ALADDIN: It's a flying carpet.

JASMINE: It’s lovely. (CARPET takes Jasmine's hand with a pompom.)

ALADDIN: You, uh, you don't want to take a ride, do you? We could leave the palace, see the world.

JASMINE: Is it safe?

ALADDIN: Of course. Do you trust me?

JASMINE: (She looks at him upon hearing this very important sentence) What?

ALADDIN: (Stretching out his hand as before) Do you trust me?

JASMINE: (leaves a smirk on her face) Yes.

(She takes his hand and climbs onto CARPET. He zooms up to the sky, making them both sit down.
The music of “A Whole New World” swells. JASMINE turns around and sees RAJAH looking at her questioningly.
She gasps as they fly over the palace wall and rise into the sky.)

ALADDIN: I can show you the world Brilliant, shimmering, splendid. Tell me princess, when was the last time you let your heart decide?

(CARPET zooms through town, stopping slightly to pick a flower. He gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE. She smiles.)
I can open your eyes Make you marvel with wonder Over, side and under On a flying carpet

(CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms in on the clouds.) A whole new world!
A fantastic new point of view No one to tell us no Or where to go Or say we're just dreaming

(JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from view. CARPET flies in and out of the clouds.)

JASMINE: A whole new world A dazzling place I've never known But when I'm up there It's crystal clear That now I'm in a whole new world with you!

ALADDIN: Now I'm in a whole new world with you!

(They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues its flight. It then circles a pillar of clouds, giving it a swirling appearance.)

JASMINE: Incredible views An indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, rolling free Through an endless sky of diamonds

(They join a flock of birds in the sky. One of them looks terrified and squeals.
CARPET does somersaults and flips, sometimes sending ALADDIN and JASMINE into free fall, but catching them.
They then zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.)

JASMINE: A whole new world!

ALADDIN: Don't you dare close your eyes

JASMINE: A hundred thousand things to see

ALADDIN: Hold your breath, it gets better!

JASMINE: I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far that I can't go back to where I was!

(They are flying over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the ship's sails are the Great Pyramids.
They greet a worker who is sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx. He smiles, but scissors too much and breaks the front of the nose.)

ALADDIN: A whole new world!

JASMINE: Every turn is a surprise

ALADDIN: With new horizons to pursue

JASMINE: Every moment, red letter

(They fly alongside running wild horses. JASMINE caresses one of them.)

BOTH: I'll chase them anywhere There's free time Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world That's where we'll be

(They cross Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a tree and rolls it on his arm towards JASMINE,
who is now sure that she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.)

ALADDIN: A thrilling chase

JASMINE: A wonderful place

BOTH: For you and me!

(CARPET hovers over a lake and we see the reflection of the moon in the lake.
Fireworks go off and we see the couple at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.)

JASMINE: It’s so magical.

ALADDIN: Yeah.

JASMINE: (looks at him) It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

ALADDIN: No. He hates fireworks. (CARPET looks up realizing what's happening.) He doesn't like to fly either.
(And now ALADDIN realizes it) It's… oh no!

JASMINE: (she takes off her turban) You're the boy from the market! I knew it. Why did you lie to me?

ALADDIN: Jasmine, I'm sorry.

JASMINE: Did you think I was stupid?

ALADDIN: No!

JASMINE: That I wouldn’t understand?

ALADDIN: No. I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't. No, that's not what I meant.

JASMIN: Who are you? Tell me the truth!

ALADDIN: The truth? (He looks at CARPET who signals him to continue, losing hope.)
The truth, uh... the–the truth is, I sometimes dress like a commoner to escape the pressures of palace life. (CARPET collapses in defeat.)
But I really am a prince! (The feather of his turban falls on his eyes.)

JASMINE: Why didn't you tell me?

ALADDIN: Well, you know, uh... royalty going out on the town in disguise, that seems a little strange, don't you think?

JASMINE: Not so strange.

(She lifts the feather and snuggles against him. CARPET puts a pompom under his "chin" and looks mystified.
Dissolve outside. from the balcony of the palace, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return. CARPET forms a staircase and it goes down.
ALADDIN then descends just below the balcony.)

JASMINE: Good night, my handsome prince.

ALADDIN: Sleep well, princess.

(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps into him and they kiss sooner than expected.
She walks away slowly then turns and looks at him. Finally, she enters his room through the curtain.)

ALADDIN: Yes! (He lands on the CARPET, which goes down to the floor.) For the first time in my life, things are starting to go well.

(He looks up at Jasmine's balcony and four pairs of hands grab him.)

ALADDIN: Hey! What? (A gag is tied around his mouth. Muffled words) Abu! Abu! (We see the elephant hanging from a net attached to a tree.)

ABU: Yes?

GUARD: Hold him!

(Chains are placed on his feet and hands. Another GUARD ties the MAT in a knot around a tree.)

JAFAR: I fear you have worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo. (He walks away.) Make sure he's never found.

(A GUARD hits him in the head and he falls unconscious. Cut to a cliff, where the GUARDS are laughing as Aladdin's body falls into the water.
He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock. The rock hits the bottom of the sea, then the turban lands and the lamp falls.
He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp. However, he loses consciousness and falls to the ground.
The lamp, disturbed by his movement, rolls and rubs against his hands. He shakes and the GENIUS emerges with a bath brush, a rubber duck and a shower cap.)

GENIUS: Never fail. Get into the bath and scrub the lamp. (duck squeaks) Hello. (sees ALADDIN unconscious)
Al? Al! Kid, stop! You can't cheat on this one! I can't help you unless you make a wish.
You have to say "Genius, I want you to save my life." Got it? All right. Go Aladdin!! (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and shakes him.
His head rises, then falls.) I take that as a yes. (The head turns into a mermaid.) Wooga! Wow! (Transforms into a submarine.)
Up to the range! (He babbles something that sounds like German. On the surface, a giant jet of water emerges and lands on top of the cliff.
ALADDIN wakes up and spits water from his lungs.) Don't scare me like that!

ALADDIN: Genie, I--uh, I-uh... (He doesn't know how to say it, so they just kiss.) Thank you, Genie.

GENIE: Oh, Al. I'm starting to like you, kid. Not that I want to pick out curtains or anything.

(Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing her hair. The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors, hypnotized.)

SULTAN: Jasmine!

JASMINE: Oh, father, I just had the most wonderful time. I am so happy.

SULTAN: (Still monotone from hypnosis) You should be, Jasmine. I chose a husband for you.

JASMIN: What?

SULTAN: (The other door opens to reveal JAFAR.) You will marry Jafar.

(JASMINE gasps at the sight.)

JAFAR: You are speechless, I see. A great quality in a wife.

JASMINE: I will never marry you. (She goes to the SULTAN) Father, I choose Prince Ali!

JAFAR: Prince Ali is gone!

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in front of the balcony door.)

ALADDIN: You better check your crystal ball again, Jafar!

JASMINE: Prince Ali!

(JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.)

IAGO: How the hell... (back to the parrot)... uh, awk!

ALADDIN: Tell them the truth, Jafar. You tried to get me killed!

JAFAR: What? (He goes towards the SULTAN) This is ridiculous, Your Highness. He's obviously lying. (He brings the stick closer to the SULTAN's face.)

SULTAN: Obviously... lying.

(ALADDIN sees the staff with his glowing eyes.)

JASMINE: Father, what is wrong with you?

ALADDIN: I know what's wrong!

(ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the ground. JAFAR jumps and the spell is broken for good.)

SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh my God!

ALADDIN: Your Highness, Jafar is controlling you with this! (He brings the stick forward)

SULTAN: What? Jafar?! You, traitor!

(The trio advances on JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Your Majesty, all this can be explained.

SULTAN: Guards! Guards!

IAGO: Well, that's all, we're dead, forget it. Just dig a grave for both of us. Were dead.

(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket. He makes a move, but is caught by the guards.)

SULTAN: Arrest Jafar immediately.

JAFAR: It's not done yet, my boy!

(JAFAR takes a vial from his pocket. ALADDIN sees him and rushes at him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the ground.
A big red cloud appears. When he's gone, so will JAFAR.)

SULTAN: Find him! Search everywhere!

ALADDIN: Jasmine, are you okay?

JASMIN: Yes.

(They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN bursts in between them.)

SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted advisor, has been plotting against me all this time. Simply horrible. How will I ever-
(He stops mid-sentence and looks at the two men.) Could this be true? My daughter has finally chosen a suitor?
(She nods) Ha ha! Praise Allah! You brilliant boy, I could kiss you! I won't... I'll leave that to my... You will be married at the same time!
Yes yes. And you will be happy and prosperous, and then my boy, you will be sultan!

ALADDIN: Sultan?

SULTAN: Yes, an honest young man like you, a person of your impeccable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs!
(ALADDIN looks worried.)

(Cut to inside JAFAR's apartments. JAFAR and IAGO enter.)

IAGO: We have to get out of here! We need to... I need to start packing, Your Highness. Only the essentials (IAGO starts throwing objects out of his cage.
JAFAR smiles broadly.) Travel light! Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes a photo of him and JAFAR) and how about this photo?
I don't know, I think I'm making a weird face. (JAFAR starts laughing wildly.) Oh, boy, he's cracked. He became crazy.
(IAGO flies towards him and hits his head.) Jafar! Jafar! Have a grip! (JAFAR grabs him by the neck) Good catch!

JAFAR: Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged kid, Aladdin! He has the lamp, Iago.

IAGO: Why is it miserable...

JAFAR: But you're going to get rid of it!

Iago: Me?

(Cut to outside the palace. ALADDIN looks at the gardens.)

ALADDIN: Sultan? They want me to be sultan?

(GENIE comes out of the lamp)

GENIE: Huzzah! Hail the conquering hero! (Turns into a one-man band. He sees ALADDIN walking away with his head down.
He stops, scratches his head, has an idea, then walks over to ALADDIN.
He raises his hands like a director framing a film and we watch them.)
Aladdin! You have just won the princess's heart. What are you going to do next?
(ALADDIN looks at him, then walks sadly towards the bed, where he falls on it and sighs. GENIUS is confused again,
then goes to him and takes out a script called "Aladdin". Whispering :) Psst. Your sentence is: "I will release the genie." Anytime.

ALADDIN: Genius... I can't.

GENIE: Of course you can. You just say, “Geeeenie, I want you to be free. » (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses it as a ventriloquist's dummy.
ALADDIN walks away.)
ALADDIN: I'm serious! Look, I'm sorry, I really am. But they want to make me a sultan... no! They want to make Prince Ali the Sultan. Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

GENIE: Al, you win!

ALADDIN: Because of you! The only reason people think I'm worth anything is because of you! What if they find out I'm not really a prince?
(Calmly) What if Jasmine finds out? I would lose it. Genius, I can't do this alone! I...I can't wish you freedom.

GENIE: (sarcastically) Fine, I understand. After all, you lied to everyone.
Hey, I was starting to feel left out. Now, if you will excuse me, master... (He says the last word with disgust, then returns to the lamp.)

(ABU and CARPET watch from the window.)

ABU: Ohhh...

ALADDIN: Genie, I'm so sorry. (A tongue sticks out of the beak and raspberries it.) Good, very good!
(He covers the LAMP with a pillow.) So... stay in there! (He looks at ABU and CARPET.) What are you looking at?
(They both leave.) Listen, I... I'm sorry... A-Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't... wait. Come on! (He sighs.) What am I doing? The genius is right.
I...I have to tell Jasmine the truth.

JASMINE: (from a distance) Ali, oh Ali, will you come here?

ALADDIN: (Sighing while putting on his turban) Well, there you go. (He enters the garden.) Jasmine? Where are you?

(We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO in the pond. He imitates JASMINE's voice.)

IAGO: Ahem... In the menagerie, hurry up.

ALADDIN: I'm coming.

(We see ALADDIN hurrying past, not noticing the birds. IAGO laughs wickedly, then turns and looks into the face of a panting FLAMINGO.)

FLAMINGO: Uh!

IAGO: Do you have a problem, pinky?! (He sweeps the bird's legs from underneath.
IAGO laughs happily as he runs through the palace and finds the lamp under the pillow.)
Boy, Jafar is going to be happy to see you! (He stretches his face like JAFAR's and imitates him.)
Great job, Iago! (Normal) Ah, continue. (JAFAR) No, really – on a scale of one to ten, you… are an eleven!
(Normal) Oh, Jafar, you are so nice. I'm embarrassed, I'm blushing. (He flies away with the lamp.)

(Cut to the entrance to the palace. The SULTAN stands at the top and makes an announcement to the people.)

SULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a suitor!

(Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is looking. ALADDIN appears at the bottom of the stairs.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine?

JASMINE: Ali, where have you been?

ALADDIN: Jasmine, there is something I need to tell you.

JASMINE: The whole kingdom gathered for the father's announcement!

ALADDIN: No! But Jasmine, please listen to me!

JASMINE: Good luck! (She pushes him onto the stage with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire crowd.)

SULTAN: …Ali Ababwa!

ALADDIN: Oh my God.

(Far above, IAGO and JAFAR look through a window.)

IAGO: Look at them, they're applauding that little squeaker.

JAFAR: Let them applaud. (He lifts the lamp and rubs it. THE GENIUS comes out.)

GENIE: You know Al, I'm getting (turns around and sees JAFAR) reallyyyyyy - I don't think you're him. (He goes down and consults a poster.)
Tonight, the role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister man.

JAFAR: I am your master now! (He throws GENIE to the ground and puts his foot on GENIE's face.)

GENIE: I was afraid of that.

JAFAR: Genie, grant me my first wish. I wish to reign on high, as SULTAN!

(Cut to where dark clouds surround the castle. The castle shakes. The roof is torn off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN shoot each other.)

ALADDIN: Wow!

SULTAN: Bless my soul. What is this? What is going on? Oh my God, what is happening?!

JASMINE: Father!

(His turban comes off his head. When he catches it, his whole body flies away, then is stripped of all his clothes except his boxers.
The clothes reappear on JAFAR.)

JAFAR: Hey hey hey!

SULTAN: Jafar, you... vile traitor.

IAGO: For you, it's Sultan Vile Betrayer.

ALADDIN: Oh yeah? Well, we'll just see that! (removes his own turban, but finds it empty) The lamp!

JAFAR: Finders-keepers, Abooboo.

(They both look up and see a gigantic GENIUS lifting the palace into the clouds. ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies off to greet him.
They fly near the GENIE's head.)

ALADDIN: Genius! No!

GENIE: Sorry, kid, I have a new master now. (He places the palace on top of a mountain.)

SULTAN: Jafar, I order you to stop!

JAFAR: Ah, but there is a new order now... MY order! Finally, you will bow to me!

(The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.)

JAFAR: We will NEVER bow to you!

IAGO: Why am I not surprised?

JAFAR: If you don't bow to a Sultan, then you will cower to a WIZARD!
(To GENIE) Genie, my second wish: I wish to be the most powerful wizard in the world!

ALADDIN: Genius, STOP!

(GENIE extends his finger. ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he can't, and another GENIE(tm)-branded lightning bolt hits JAFAR, returning him to his normal appearance.)

IAGO: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Agrabah the wizard Jafar!

JAFAR: Now where were we? Ah yes, an abject humiliation! (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and they both bow to him.
JAFAR snickers as RAJAH rushes towards him. He zaps RAJAH and the tiger turns into a kitty.)
Down, boy! Oh, princess... (lifts her chin with her staff)... there's someone I'm dying to introduce to you.

ALADDIN: (off camera) Jafar! Don't touch her!

(JAFAR zaps ALADDIN. CARPET flies away.)

JAFAR: Prince Ali Yes, that's him, but not as you know him. Read my lips and face reality

(JAFAR brings them together in the air.) Yes, encounter a blast from your past whose lies were too good to last. Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!

(JAFAR brings ALI back to ALADDIN.)

IAGO: Or should we say Aladdin?

JASMINE: Ali.

ALADDIN: Jasmine...

JASMIN: What?

Aladdin: I tried to tell you, I'm just...

JAFAR: So Ali turns out to be just Aladdin. Just a scam, should I continue? Believe me His personality flaws Give me an adequate reason
To send him packing on a one-way ticket For his prospects to take a terminal plunge His frozen assets, the chosen location It's the end of the world, whoopeeeeeeee!
So looooooooooooong,

IAGO: Goodbye, see you soon!

JAFAR: Ex-Priiiiiiiince Aaaaaaaallllllliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!

(JAFAR has ABU returned to normal. He sends them both into a large pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before CARPET can enter.
F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where the pillar crashes and rolls. It eventually stops. ALADDIN emerges, visibly very cold.)

ALADDIN: Abu? Abuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!

(He looks at a pile of shaking snow.) Oh, this is all my fault – I should have freed the genie when I had the chance.
(He digs up ABU and puts him in his vest.) Abu! Do you agree? I'm sorry, Abu. I messed it up...
either way. I have to go back and make things right. (He starts walking in the snow, and ends up walking on a frozen CARPET.)
Carpet! (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by the pillar. He pulls to try to free CARPET.
He can't do it, so he starts clearing the snow from the base of the pillar.) Abu, start digging! That's it!
(Finally, enough snow has been removed and the pillar begins to roll. ALADDIN runs away, looks back, then gets into place.
The pillar rolls over him, and when it disappears, ALADDIN and ABU find themselves sitting in the snow patch formed by the pillar's window.)
Yeah! All right! (He looks up at his turban, made from frightened ABU. CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes to collect them.)
Now, back to Agrabah! Let's go!

(We return to a long external shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds. Cut to a slow, interior zoom of the throne room.
IAGO has the SULTAN tied up like a puppet, and JASMINE is chained next to the throne.)

IAGO: The puppet leader wants a cracker? Here's your cracker. Shove them all down your throat. Here, have plenty!

(JAFAR pulls the chain and JASMINE approaches him holding an apple.)

JASMINE: Stop it! Jafar, leave him alone!

(IAGO stops for a second, then continues.)

JAFAR: It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. (He bites into the apple she is holding.) A beautiful desert flower like you should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do you say, my dear? Why, with you as queen...

(She takes a glass of wine and throws it in his face.)

JASMINE: Never!

JAFAR: I'm going to teach you some respect! (She falls back as he raises his hand to slap her. Then he stops.) No. Genius... I decided to make my last wish. I wish Princess Jasmine would fall hopelessly in love with me.

(JASMINE gasps. We see ALADDIN running back into town.)

GENIE: (again as Buckley) Ah, master... there are some addenda, quid pro quo.

JAFAR: Don't answer me, you big thug! YOU will do what I order you to do... slave!

(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning for her to play the game.)

JASMINE: (She gets up and puts the crown on her head.) Jafar! Hm, I never realized how... incredibly beautiful you are.

(The GENIUS' jaw drops.)

JAFAR: Mm, that's better. (He lifts the GENIUS' jaw like a shadow.) Now... kitty, tell me more about... myself.

JASMINE: You are... tall... and dark...

JAFAR: Yes?

JASMINE: Well dressed...

(JAFAR approaches her. ALADDIN jumps with ABU and GENIE sees them.)

GENIE: Al! Al, little friend!

ALADDIN: Shh!

GENIE: (Literally closes his mouth, then opens it.) Al, I can't help you, I work for a master psycho now. (His head transforms into JAFAR's, then returns.)

ALADDIN: Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? (He closes GENIE's mouth.) I'm improvising.

(He slides a pile of coins and hides near JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR turns his back on ALADDIN.)

JAFAR: Continue.

JASMINE: And your beard... is so... crooked! You stole my heart... (She wraps her arms around him.
She pretends to twist with her finger, but she is actually beckoning ALADDIN to come. He makes his move. IAGO sees it.)

IAGO: Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.)

JAFAR: And the street rat?

JASMINE: What street rat?

(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl. JAFAR turns to look, but JASMINE catches him and kisses him.
ALADDIN looks disgusted. Both IAGO and ABU look disgusted.)

ABU AND IAGO: Yuck!

JAFAR: It was... (he sees ALADDIN's reflection in his crown.) YOU! How many times do I have to kill you, boy?!

(He zaps ALADDIN. JASMINE rushes at him, and he throws her to the ground. ALADDIN rushes and grabs the stick.)

ALADDIN: Get the lamp!

(JASMINE runs towards him. JAFAR, however, shakes ALADDIN, then sends him into an hourglass.)

JAFAR: No! Ah-ah-ah, princess... Your time is up!

ALADDIN: Jasmine!

(Sand begins to fall from above on her.)

IAGO: Ooh, nice move, Jaf-- (he is knocked out by ABU.)

(ABU rushes towards the lamp.)

JAFAR: Don't play with me! (He is transformed into a toy monkey.)

ALADDIN: Abu!

(TAPIT rushes.)

JAFAR: Things are moving fast now, boy! (JAFAR laughs as CARPET is zapped and unravels.
ALADDIN rushes towards the lamp again.) Do you understand? (His path is blocked by large swords stuck in the ground.
JAFAR grabs the lamp and laughs horribly. ALADDIN draws a sword from the ground.) I'm just warming up! (He spits a ring of fire around ALADDIN.)

ALADDIN: Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?!

JAFAR: A snake, right? Maybe you would like to see how much like a snake I can look! (He smiles widely and we see a snake's tongue sticking out from behind his teeth.
He then transforms into a giant cobra and the ring of fire around ALADDIN is part of the snake that surrounds ALADDIN.
The snake JAFAR moves at ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN swings the sword and hits JAFAR. Cut to GENIE cheerleaders wearing 'A' sweaters.)

GENIES: Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake – stick that sword into that snake!

JAFAR: Stay out of it!

(GENIE waving a small pennant with a “J” on it.)

GENIE: (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man. If he can't do it, GREAT!

(ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where JASMINE is trapped. However, JAFAR sees him and blocks the path.
ALADDIN is thrown and he loses his sword.)

JASMINE: Aladdin!

(ALADDIN jumps onto a large gem and slides across the ground, catching the sword on his way.
He turns a corner, but the snake chasing him can't, and JAFAR's front half crashes through a wall and crashes outside the palace.
ALADDIN jumps on the snake's back and stabs it. JAFAR screams in agony. ALADDIN tries to free the princess again.)

ALADDIN: Jasmine, wait!

(He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR catches him.)

JAFAR: (laughing hideously) You little fool! You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth?!

IAGO: (with GENIE coming up behind him) Squeeze him, Jafar. Squeeze it like a...awk! (GENIE nudges him)

JAFAR: Without genius, my boy, you are nothing!

ALADDIN: (has an idea) The genius. The genius! Genie has more power than you will ever have!

JAFAR: What?!

ALADDIN: He gave you your power! He can take it off!

GENIE: Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing me into this?

ALADDIN: Admit it, Jafar! You're still only... second best!

JAFAR: You are right! His power exceeds mine. But not for long...

(JAFAR revolves around the GENIE.)

GENIUS: This boy is crazy. He's a little drunk on punch. One shot too many with the snake. (His hand turns into a snake and he hits his head with it.)

JAFAR: Slave! I'm making my third wish! I wish to be... an ALMIGHTY GENIUS!

GENIE: (reluctantly) Very good. Your wishes are orders. Well done, Al.

(GENIE zaps JAFAR with the final GENIE(tm) brand lightning bolt). JAFAR's snake form dissipates and he transforms into a genie.
We see JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand. ALADDIN runs up and ends up breaking the glass. Sand and Princess Jasmine are pouring out.)

JAFAR: Yes... Yes! Power... Absolute power!

JASMINE: (to ALADDIN) What did you do?

ALADDIN: Believe me!

(A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base. JAFAR is conjuring.)

JAFAR: The universe belongs to me! Control!

ALADDIN: Not so fast, Jafar! Aren't you forgetting something?

JAFAR: (looks down questioningly) Huh?

ALADDIN: Do you want to be a genius? You got it!

(Chains appear on JAFAR's wrists.)

JAFAR: WHAT?!

ALADDIN: And everything that goes with it!

JAFAR: No! NOOOO!

IAGO: I'm leaving here!

ALADDIN: Phenomenal cosmic powers!

(IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked into JAFAR.)

IAGO: Come on, you're the genius! I don't want to, I don't want to--!

ALADDIN: A very small living space.

GENIUS: Al, you little genius, you!

(ABU returns to normal, the CARPET parades again, JASMINE, the SULTAN and RAJAH stand together.
RAJAH jumps into the SULTAN's arms, then they are all transformed. The SULTAN is crushed because of the weight of the new RAJAH.
The palace reappears where it was in the city. ALADDIN holds the new lamp.)

JAFAR: (both from inside the lamp.) Get your damn beak out of my face!

IAGO: Oh, shut up, you moron!

JAFAR: Don't tell ME to shut up!

GENIE: Allow me. (He takes the lamp and goes to the balcony. He is now wearing a baseball cap.
He ends up wanting to throw the lamp, but opens his palm flat and throws it into the desert with his finger.)
Ten thousand years spent in a cave of wonders should calm him down!

(Jafar and Iago continue to argue as they disappear. Jasmine walks towards Aladdin. They hold hands, but both look sad.)

Aladdin: Jasmine, I'm sorry for lying to you about being a prince.

Jasmine: I know why you did it.

Aladdin: Well, I guess...this...is this goodbye? (GENIE pokes his head around the corner, shocked by what he hears.)

Jasmine: Oh, this stupid law. It is not fair ! I love you.

Genie: (wipes a tear) Al, no problem. You still have one wish left. Just say the word and you will become a prince again.

Aladdin: But Genie, what about your freedom?

Genie: Hey, it's just an eternity of servitude. It's love. (He leans next to her.)
Al, you won't find another girl like her in a million years. Believe me, I know. I watched.

Aladdin: Jasmine, I love you, but... I have to stop pretending to be something I'm not.

Jasmine: I understand.

(They look into each other's eyes one last time, then ALADDIN turns to the GENIUS.)

Aladdin: Genie, I wish for your freedom.

Genius: A true pedigree of a prince to come. What I ?

Aladdin: (He holds the lamp towards GENIE.) Genie, you are free!

(A transformation scene ensues, in which the chains fall from GENIE's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground. GENIE picks it up and looks at it.)

Genie: (He can't believe it.) Hey, hey! I'm free. I'm free. (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.) Quick, quick, wish for something extraordinary.
Say "I want the Nile". Nile Wish. Try this!

Aladdin: I wish for the Nile.

Genie: No way! (Laughing hysterically. He bounces on the balcony like a pinball.) Oh, does that feel good! I'm free! I'm finally free!
I'm hitting the road. I'm off to discover the world! I--

(He packs a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking very sad.)

Aladdin: Genie, I'm going to miss you.

Genie: Me too, Al. (sniffles) No matter what anyone says... you'll always be a prince to me.

(They kiss. The sultan comes forward.)

Sultan: That's true. You have certainly proven your worth as far as I am concerned. It is this law that poses a problem.

Jasmine: Father?

Sultan: Well, am I sultan or am I sultan? From this day on, the princess will marry whoever she deems worthy.

Jasmine: (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDIN's arms.) Him! I choose... I choose you, Aladdin.

Aladdin: Hey. Call me Al.

(They are about to kiss when giant blue hands gather everyone together. Genie is wearing a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat.)

Genie: Oh, all of you. Come here. Big group hug! Group hug, Ooh! Do you mind if I kiss the monkey? (He kisses Abu.)
Ooh, furball! Well, I can't make any more messes around this ice cream stand. I am leaving! Goodbye, you two crazy lovebirds!
Hey, Rugman: ciao! I am history! No, I am mythology! No, I don't care what I am, I'm free!

(The Genie flies into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparks behind him.
They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse as fireworks explode over a nightscape. We tilt and see Aladdin and Jasmine flying on a carpet.)

[Aladdin]
An entirely new world
[Jasmine]
A whole new life
Both:
(with off-camera chorus) For you and me!
[Men's choir]
An entirely new world!
(They fly away in the moonlight, and after their disappearance, the moon turns around and reveals the laughing face of the GENIUS.
Suddenly the film is torn "from the projector", the GENIUS lifts it and looks at the audience.)

Genie: I made you watch.

(Returns the film to normal, with the moon normal. Fade to black)


Aladdin

(Fade to black. A tendril of purple mist in front of a wall of red flames.
-The mist forms in golden letters: “Aladdin”. The letters sparkle then fly away. In a desert, a little peddler rides a camel)

Pedlar: ♪ Oh, I come from a country, ♪

♪ from a distant place ♪

♪ Where the camels of the caravan wander ♪

♪ Where it is flat and immense, ♪

♪ And the heat is intense ♪

♪ It’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home! ♪

♪ When the wind comes from the east, ♪

♪ And the sun comes from the west, ♪

♪ And the sand in the glass is right ♪

♪ Come down, come see us ♪

♪ Jump on a mat and fly ♪

♪ Towards another Arab night! ♪

♪ The Thousand and One Nights ♪

♪ Like Arab days ♪

♪ Most often ♪

♪ Are hotter than hot ♪

♪ In many ways ♪

♪ The Thousand and One Nights ♪

♪ 'under the Arab moons ♪

♪ An unprepared fool ♪

♪ could fall and fall hard ♪

♪ over there on the dunes. ♪

(In a night street, the peddler gets off his camel and addresses us)

[camel panting]

Peddler: Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. Please, please come closer.
(Camera zooms in and hits the peddler in the face) Too close. A little too close.
(He moves his face a little further from the camera) There you go. Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, enchantment,
(Opens the pouch of his camel which transforms into a bazaar stall) and the most beautiful goods on this side of the Jordan, on sale today.
Get off. Eh eh. Look at this. Yes. Hookah and coffee maker combination. Also makes julienne fries. Will not break. (he taps it on the table) won't...
(collapses) It broke. Ohh! Look at this. (takes out a Tupperware) I've never seen one intact before. This is the famous Tupperware from the Dead Sea.
Listen. (He opens it, makes a raspberry noise..) Ah, it's always good. (The camera starts to pan to the right. The peddler rushes to catch him.) Wait, don't go there! (Stop the pan.)
I see you are only interested in what is exceptionally rare. I think you would then be very rewarded for thinking about it.
(The peddler takes out the iconic magic lamp from his sleeve.) Don't let its mundane appearance fool you.
As with many things, it's not what's on the outside that matters, but what's on the inside. (Another pan, this one slower to the left.
Once again, the peddler rushes to catch up.) This is no ordinary lamp! It changed the course of a young man's life.
A young man who loved this lamp was more than he seemed. A diamond in the rough. Maybe you would like to hear the story?
(The peddler pours the shining sand from the lamp into his hand.)
It begins on a dark night… (The peddler throws sand into the sky, where it forms a starry nightscape.) where a dark man waits with a dark goal.

(The camera tilts to find Jafar sitting on his horse and Iago on his shoulder. Gazeem walks up to the two.)

[horse nickels]

Jafar: You're late.

Gazeem: Many apologies, O Patient One.

Jafar: Do you have it then?

Gazeem: I had to cut a few throats, but I managed. (He takes out half of the locket. Jafar grabs it, but Gazeem pulls it out.) Ah-ah-ahhh. The treasure. (Iago Iago squeals as he passes and grabs the locket.) Ouch!

Jafar: Trust me, my prickly friend. You will get what comes to you.

Iago: What's wrong with you? Awk!

(Jafar takes out the second half of the medallion. He connects them, forming a golden beetle. It comes to life and flies away.)

Jafar: Quick! Follow the trail!

(On horseback, the trio pursues the medallion through the moonlit desert)

Faster!

(The creature splits in two, each half lodged in a sand dune. A massive tiger's head rises from the dune. The beetle's pieces form its glowing eyes.
The men's horses rear up on their hind legs, toppling their riders. Jafar smiles as the tiger head opens its cavernous mouth.)

[the horse whinnies]

[howling wind]

Jafar: Finally, after all my years of searching, the Cave of Wonders.

Iago: Awk. Cave of Wonders!

Gazeem: (whispering) By Allah...

Jafar: Now remember. Bring me the lamp! The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine. [laughs]

(Gazeem begins to approach the lion's mouth, which is the entrance to the cave. He laughs as he walks away.)

Iago: Oh, the lamp. Oh, the lamp. (Now that Iago and Jafar are alone, Iago opens up in normal English.) Damn, where did you find that bozo?

(Jafar puts his finger to his lips and shushes him. Gazeem crawls towards the oral entrance of the cave.
He looks inside the mouth as his tongue turns into a staircase.
He tiptoes around one of the tiger's fangs, but is amazed by the roar of the cave's words.)

Cave: [echoing growl] Who is disturbing my sleep?

Gazeem: [the thief gasps] It's me, Gazeem, a humble thief.

Cave: Mo that. Only one can enter here, the one whose value lies far away. A diamond in the rough.

(Gazeem turns to Jafar with a questioning look.)

Jafar: What are you waiting for? Keep on going.

[the beast sighs]

(Gazeem hesitates, then advances a foot inside the cave. With great apprehension, he puts his foot down. Nothing happens. Relieved, he begins his walk again. Then another roar comes. He turns around, but the The lion's mouth closes and the dune collapses and returns to normal. All that remains is Jafar, Iago and the 2 separated halves of the medallion.)

Jafar: Now!

Cavern: Look for the diamond in the rough.

Iago: [coughs] I can't believe it. I just don't believe it! We'll never get our hands on that stupid lamp! Forget that ! Look at this. Look at this.
I'm so tickled I'm molting. (He flies to Jafar's shoulder.)

Jafar: Patience, Iago. Patience. Gazeem obviously wasn't worth it.

Iago: (extremely sarcastic) Oh, there's a big surprise. It's incredible... I think I'm going to have a heart attack and die from this surprise.
What are we going to do? We have a big problem here, a big- (Jafar pinches his beak.)

Jafar: Yes. Only one can enter. I have to find this one, this... diamond in the rough.

(Cut to a roof, where Aladdin rushes to the edge, carrying a loaf of bread. He almost drops it over the edge.)

Razoul: Stop! Thief! I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat!

Aladdin: (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.) All this for a loaf of bread? Whoooaa!

(He jumps and lands on two ropes strung between buildings, with clothes drying on them. He descends them into the sky, picking up pieces of clothing on himself as he goes. Eventually, he approaches the end of the rope , near a window, when a woman reaches out and slams the shutters. Aladdin slams against the shutters and falls into the street, his fall broken by numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him. He removes the top layer of clothing and is about to cum. his bread when…)

Guard 1: There he is!

Guard 2: You won't get away with this easily!

Aladdin: Do you think it was easy?

(He looks at three women and makes fun of him.)

Razoul: You two, this way, and you, follow me. We will find him.

(Aladdin puts a sheet over himself and wraps himself up to disguise himself. He rushes towards the women.)

Aladdin: Hello, ladies.

Woman 1: We're in trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin?

Aladdin: A problem? Now it's gone. You'll only get in trouble if you get caught.

(A hand grabs Aladdin's shoulder and pulls him back. It's Razoul. Aladdin's disguise falls off.)

Razoul: I got you!

Aladdin: I'm in trouble.

Razoul: And this time... (A howling cry from Abu, then the guard's turban is lowered over his eyes. Abu points to the guard's head, laughing.)

Aladdin: Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

Abu: Abu.

Aladdin: Come on. Let's get out of here. I have to keep...

(A guard swings at Aladdin, but destroys a barrel of fish. Abu raspberries the guard, then dodges an attack. Then Aladdin pulls down the guard's pants)

♪ One jump ahead of the finish line ♪

♪ One step ahead of the sword ♪

♪ I only steal what I can't afford ♪ That's all.

(Aladdin runs away, the guard passes a fish over his lower body like pants.)

♪ A step ahead of the law ♪

♪ That's it and now it's a joke ♪

♪ These guys don't like that I'm broke! ♪

(Aladdin and Aby climb onto a stack of barrels, then knock one off the guards.)

Guards: (One at a time) ♪ Riffraff! ♪

♪ Street rat! ♪

♪ Scoundrel! ♪

(throws fruit at Aladdin) ♪ Take that! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Just a little snack, guys. ♪

Guards: ♪ Tear it up, take it back, guys! ♪

(Aladdin runs to the top of a platform. The guards shake the platform back and forth to try to make him fall.)

Aladdin: ♪ I can understand ♪

♪ I have to face the facts ♪

(Aladdin jumps from the platform to certain death, only to grab Abu's hands like an acrobat. The couple swings in a harem.)

♪ You are my only friend, Abu! ♪

Harem girls: who?

♪ Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom ♪

(Abou finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth like a chipmunk.)

♪ He became a single man to increase crime ♪

Woman 2: ♪ I would blame the parents, except he didn't leave them. ♪

Aladdin: ♪ I must eat to live,

♪ I have to steal to eat ♪

♪ I'll tell you all about it when I have time! ♪

(Aladdin and Abu come out and bounce on an awning. Cut to a muscular man bending over in front of a crowd.
The guards rush. Cut to Aladdin and Abu behind the muscular man, matching his movements, until they make a mistake and are discovered. )

♪ A jump ahead of slowpokes. ♪

♪ One step before my loss. ♪

♪ Next time I'll use a pen name. ♪

Razoul: There he is!

(A chase sequence, in which Aladdin and Abu, pursued by the guards, run through a flock of sheep and hit an artist sleeping on a bed of nails [of course, an extremely large guard lands on him])

Aladdin: ♪ A leap ahead of the hitmen ♪

♪ One step ahead of the herd ♪

♪ I think I'll take a walk around the neighborhood ♪

(Abou disguises himself with jewelry until a shopkeeper discovers him.)

Man 1: ♪ Stop, thief! ♪

Shopkeeper 1: ♪ Vandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Abu! ♪

Woman 3: ♪ Scandal! ♪

Aladdin: ♪ Let's not be in too much of a hurry ♪

(Aladdin is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens and a tall, ugly lady comes out)

Lady: ♪ However, I find it rather tasty! ♪

(Aladdin tumbles, then puts his arm around a guard, acting like they're all friends.)

Aladdin: ♪ I must eat to live, ♪

♪ I have to steal to eat ♪

♪ Otherwise, we would get along well! ♪

Guards: WRONG!!!

(The guards jump at Aladdin, but get tangled. Their targets sneak into pots)

Main Guard: Get him!

(Aladdin jumps onto an artist walking harmlessly across hot coals. The guards rush through the coals, jumping in pain as they burn their feet.
Aladdin and Abu come across a sword swallower, then Abu returns to remove the sword from the swallower's mouth. Abu walks towards the guards, who stop in fear.)

Guard: He has a sword!

Razoul: You idiots. We all have swords!

(The guards draw their swords. Abu puts down his sword and runs away. Aladdin and Abu are surrounded again, with guards coming from left and right.
He jumps and climbs a dress trick in progress on the street, as the guards all crash into each other.)

Aladdin: ♪ One jump ahead of the beating of hooves ♪

Guards: Vandal!

Aladdin: ♪ One jump ahead of the hump ♪

Guards: Street rat!

Aladdin: ♪ One turn before disaster ♪

Guards: Scoundrel!

Aladdin: ♪ They are fast, but I am much faster ♪

Guards: Take that!

(The guards chase Aladdin up a staircase into a room. He grabs a rug...)

Aladdin: ♪ There you go, ♪

♪ You better get your hands on it ♪

♪ Wish me a safe landing, ♪

♪ All I have to do is jump! ♪

(..and jumps out the window like the carpet is magic. The guards follow him out the window, but they fall straight into the street and land in a fertilizer cart with the sign "Crazy Hakim's Discount Fertilizer.")

Guards: Yuck! Hey!

(Aladdin uses the carpet as a parachute to land safely and out of danger. Aladdin and Abu greet each other)

Aladdin: And now, esteemed effendi, we feast. All right.

(Aladdin breaks the bread in two and gives half to ABU who begins to eat.
But Aladdin looks and sees two young children rummaging through the trash looking for food.
The girl sees him, then drops her find and tries to hide. Aladdin looks at them solemnly, then at the bread, then Abou.)

Abu: Yum, yum! Uh-oh.

(Abou takes a big bite of his food, but Aladdin gets up and walks towards the children. The girl pulls her brother back.)

Aladdin: [sighs] Here. Keep on going. Take it.

[giggles]

[groans]

Abu: Ah, don't do it. Eh?

Man: On the way to the palace, I suppose. Another suitor for the princess.

[giggles]

[woman screams]

[whinnying]

Prince Ahmed: Get out of my way, you brats.

Aladdin: Hey! If I were as rich as you, I could afford some good manners.

Prince Ahmed: Oh. I'll teach you some manners!

[the men laugh]

[grimace]

Aladdin: Look at that, Abu. It's not every day you see a horse with two hindquarters.

Crowd: Ooh!

Prince Ahmed: Ha! You are a worthless street rat. You were born a street rat, you will die a street rat and only your fleas will cry for you.

Aladdin: I'm worthless. And I don't have fleas. [sighs] Come on, Abu. Let's go home.
♪ Riffraff, street rat. I don't buy that. If only they looked closer. Would they see a poor boy? No father. They would discover that I have so much more to offer. ♪
One day, Abu, things will change. We will be rich, live in a palace and never have any problems.

[roosters crow]

Prince Ahmed: I have never been so insulted.

Sultan: Oh, Prince Ahmed. You're not leaving that early, are you?

Prince Ahmed: Good luck marrying her.

Sultan: Ah! Jasmine. Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine!

[snarling]

Sultan: Confound that, Rajah. That's why Prince Ahmed stormed off.

Jasmine: Oh, father. Rajah was just playing with him.
Isn't that right, Rajah? You were just playing with that overdressed, self-centered Prince Ahmed, weren't you?

[both laugh]

[clears throat]

Sultan: Dearest, you need to stop rejecting all the suitors who come calling. The law says...

Both: you must be married to a prince...

Sultan: Until your next birthday.

Jasmine: The law is bad.

Sultan: You only have three days left.

Jasmine: Father, I hate having to do this. If I get married, I want it to be for love.

Sultan: Jasmine...it's not just this law. I'm not going to be here forever, well, I... I just want to make sure you're taken care of. Foreseen.

Jasmine: Please try to understand. I've never done anything on my own. I never had real friends.

[groans]

Jasmine: Except you, Rajah. I never even left the palace walls.

Sultan: But, Jasmine, you are a princess.

Jasmine: So maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore.

Sultan: Oooh! I...I...Allah forbids you from having daughters.

Rajah: Hmm?

Sultan: I don't know where she got that from. His mother wasn't that difficult. Oh! Ah, Jafar. My most trusted advisor. I desperately need your wisdom.

Jafar: My life is only to serve you, my lord.

Sultan: It's the suitors' business. Jasmine refuses to choose a husband. I'm at the end of my tether.

Iago: Awk! End of the rope!

Sultan: [laughing] Oh! Have a biscuit, pretty Polly.

Jafar: [Jafar laughs] Your Majesty certainly has a way with stupid animals.

[Iago growls]

Jafar: Now I can perhaps guess a solution to this thorny problem.

Sultan: If anyone can help, it's you.

Jafar: But that would require the use of the Mystic Blue Diamond.

Sultan: Oh. Uh, my ring? But it's been in the family for years.

Jafar: We must find a suitor for the princess. Don't worry. Everything will be alright.

Sultan: Everything will be fine.

Jafar: The diamond.

Sultan: Here, Jafar. Everything you need will be fine.

Jafar: You are very kind, my liege. Now run around and play with your little toys, hmm?

Sultan: Yes. It will be pretty good.

Iago: [spits, coughs] I can't take it anymore! If I have to choke on one more of those disgusting moldy crackers... Bam! Beat!

Jafar: Calm down, Iago.

Iago: Then I grabbed him by the head. Beat!

Jafar: Soon I will be sultan, not this bothered idiot.

Iago: And then I shove the crackers down his throat. Ha, ha!

[groans]

Jasmine: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here and live my life for me. I'll miss you.

[groans]

Jasmine: Goodbye.

[salespeople call]

Aladdin: Okay, Abu. Go.

Melon Merchant: Try this. Your taste buds will dance and sing.

[squeaking]

Melon Merchant: Get your hands off that.

[cocktail]

Melon Merchant: Well, you... Get away from here, you damned, dirty monkey!

Abu: Goodbye.

Aladdin: Well done, Abu.

[cooing]

Aladdin: Breakfast is served.

Pot seller: Pretty lady, buy a pot. There is no finer pot in brass or silver.

Nut seller: Sweet dates. Sweet dates and figs. Sweet dates and pistachios.

Necklace seller: Would the lady like a necklace? A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

Fish seller: Fresh fish! We catch them, you buy them!

Jasmine: Oh, now. I do not think so. Oh!

[swallowing]

Jasmine: Excuse me.

[takes a sip]

[belches]

Jasmine: I'm really, really sorry.

Aladdin: Wow.

Abu: Uh-oh. Good morning? Good morning?

Jasmine: Oh, you must be hungry. Here is.

Apple Merchant: You better be able to pay for it.

Jasmine: Pay?

Apple Merchant: Now we're stealing from my cart.

Jasmine: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I have no money.

Apple seller: Thief!

Jasmine: Please... If you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the Sultan.

Apple merchant: Do you know what the penalty is for theft?

Jasmine: Now! Now please!

Aladdin: Thank you, kind sir. I'm so glad you found it. I looked for you everywhere.

Jasmine: What are you doing?

Aladdin: Play the game.

Apple seller: And you, uh, now this girl?

Aladdin: Unfortunately, yes. She is my sister. She's a little crazy.

Apple seller: She said she knew the sultan.

Aladdin: She thinks the monkey is the sultan.

Jasmine: O wise Sultan, how can I serve you?

[gibberish]

Aladdin: Tragic, isn't it? But no harm is done. Now come, sister. It's time to go see the doctor.

Jasmine: Oh, hello, doctor. How are you doing?

Aladdin: Now, now, now. Not this one. Come on, Sultan.

[gibbering, panting]

Apple seller: Huh? What? Come back here, you little thieves!

[blast]

Iago: With all due respect, Your Rot, couldn't we just wait out a real storm?

Jafar: Hold your breath, Iago. Faster.

Iago: Yes, O mighty Evil One. [panting]

Jafar: Gone, sands of time. Reveal to me who can enter the cave. Yes! Yes! Here it is. My diamond in the rough.

Iago: Is that him? Is this the clown we were waiting for?

Jafar: Let's let the guards offer him an invitation to the palace, okay?

Iago: Great. [cough]

[sinister laugh]

Aladdin: I'm almost there.

Jasmine: I want to thank you for stopping this man.

Aladdin: Uh, forget it. So, this is your first time on the market, huh?

Jasmine: Is it so obvious?

Aladdin: Well, you kind of stand out. I mean, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be.

Jasmine: Hmm. I learn fast.

Abu: Wow.

Aladdin: [laughing] Hey. Come on. This way. Wow. Watch your head there. Be careful.

Jasmine: Is this where you live?

Aladdin: Yes. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.

Jasmine: It looks fabulous.

Aladdin: Well, it's not much, but the view is great. Wow. The palace looks really amazing, huh?

Jasmine: Oh, that's wonderful.

Aladdin: I wonder what it would be like to live here, with servants and servants.

Jasmine: Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.

Aladdin: It's better than here. You're always looking for food and dodging guards.

Jasmine: You are not free to make your own choices.

Aladdin: Sometimes you feel so...

Jasmine: You're just...

Both: ...trapped.

Aladdin: [clears throat] So where are you from?

Jasmine: What does it matter? I ran away and I won't come back.

Aladdin: Really? How come?

Abu: Well, you...

Jasmine: My father is forcing me to get married.

Aladdin: It's... it's horrible. Abu!

[grinding angrily]

Jasmine: What?

Aladdin: Abu says, uh... that's not fair.

Abu: What?

Jasmine: Oh, isn't it?

Aladdin: Yes, of course.

Jasmine: And does Abu have anything else to say?

Aladdin: Well, uh, he wishes he could do something to help her.

Abu: Oh, boy.

Jasmine: Hmm. Tell him it's very nice.

Razoul: There you go.

Both: They're after me! You?

Jasmine: My father must have sent them...

Aladdin: Do you trust me?

Jasmine: What?

Aladdin: Do you trust me?

Jasmine: Yes...

Aladdin: Then jump!

Razoul: We keep running towards each other, don't we, street rat?

Aladdin: Run! Go! Get out of here!

Razoul: Take that thing off me! This is the dungeon for you, boy.

Aladdin: Let me go.

Jasmine: Let him go.

Razoul: Look here, men. A street mouse!

[the guards laugh]

Jasmine: Let him go, on the princess's orders.

Razoul: Princess Jasmine.

Aladdin: The princess?

Abu: Princess?

Razoul: What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat.

Jasmine: It's not your problem. Do as I command. Free him.

Razoul: I would, Princess, except my orders come from Jafar. You will need to discuss this with him.

Jasmine: Believe me, I will. Jafar?

Jafar: Oh, princess.

Iago: Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

Jafar: How can I be of service to you?

Jasmine: The guards just took a boy to the market, on your orders.

Jafar: Your father charged me with keeping the peace in Agrabah. The boy was a criminal.

Jasmine: What was his crime?

Iago: I can't breathe, Jafar.

Jafar: Why, kidnap the princess, of course.

Iago: If you could just... Aah! It hurts!

Jasmine: He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

Jafar: Oh, honey. Oh, how terribly upsetting. I had it but I knew...

Jasmine: What do you mean?

Jafar: Unfortunately, the boy's sentence has already been carried out.

Jasmine: What sentence?

Jafar: Death.

[Jasmin gasps]

Jafar: By beheading.

Jasmine: Now.

Jafar: I am extremely sorry, princess.

Jasmine: How could you? [tears]

Iago: [coughs] [coughs, panting] So, how did it go?

Jafar: I think she took it pretty well.

Jasmine: [Jasmine cries] It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't even know his name.

[Rajah whispers]

Aladdin: She was the princess. I can not believe it. I must have seemed stupid to him.

Abu: Yoo-hoo! Aladdin! Good morning!

Aladdin: Abu. Here.

[squeaking]

Aladdin: Come on, help me out of this.

[reprimand]

Aladdin: Hey, she was in trouble. Ah, she was worth it.

Abu: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Aladdin: Don't worry. I will never see her again. I'm a street rat, remember? And there is a law. She must marry a prince. She deserves a prince.

Abu: Ta-da!

Aladdin: I'm a fool.

Old Man Jafar: You're just a fool if you give up, boy.

Aladdin: Who are you?

Old Man Jafar: A humble prisoner, like you. But together, maybe we can be more.

Aladdin: I'm listening.

Old Man Jafar: There is a cave, my boy, a cave of wonders, filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams...

Abu: Oh!

Old Man Jafar: Enough treasure to impress even your princess, I'll bet.

Iago: Jafar, can you hurry up? I die here. [screaming as Jafar hits him]

Aladdin: But the law says that only a prince can...

Old Man Jafar: You've heard of the Golden Rule, haven't you? Whoever owns the gold makes the rules. [wheezing laughter]

Aladdin: So. Why would you share all this wonderful treasure with me?

Old Man Jafar: I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go.

Aladdin: Uh, a problem. It is over there. We are here.

Old Man Jafar: Uh-uh. Things are not always what they seem. So, do we have a deal?

Abu: Oh, I don't know.

[thunder crashes]

Cave: And. Who is disturbing my sleep?

Aladdin: Uh, it's me, Aladdin.

Cave: Continue. Do not touch anything except the lamp.

Old Man Jafar: Remember, my boy, go get me the lamp first, and then you will have your reward.

Aladdin: Come on, Abu.

[squeaking]

Aladdin: Would you like to look at that!

[groans]

Aladdin: Just a handful of these things would make me richer than the Sultan. Abu!

[moans]

Aladdin: Don't... touch... anything. We need to find this lamp.

Abu: [growls] Huh? Aladdin!

Aladdin: Abu, will you stop him?

[screams]

Aladdin: Abu, what are you, madman? A magic carpet. Come on. To go out. We're not going to hurt you.

[screams]

Aladdin: Hey, take it easy, Abu. He's not going to bite. THANKS.

[squeaking]

Aladdin: Hey. Wait a minute. Do not go. Maybe you can help us. Hey! Wow! You see, we are trying to find this lamp. I think he knows where it is.

[squeals enthusiastically]

[echoes]

Aladdin: [whispers] Wait here.

Abu: [moaning] Oh!

Aladdin: That's it. This is why we came here... Abu! NOW!

Cave: Infidels!

Abu: Uh-oh.

Cave: You have touched the forbidden treasure! From now on, you will never see the light of day again!

Aladdin: Wow!

Abou: Help! Help! Help!

Aladdin: I got you! Wow. Carpet, let's move. Abu! Abu, it's time to panic. Start panicking.

Both: Wow!

[Abou panting]

[cracks of thunder]

[roar]

Aladdin: Help me.

Old Man Jafar: Throw me the lamp.

Aladdin: I can't hold on. Give me your hand.

Old Man Jafar: Give me the lamp first. [maniacal laughter] Yes! Finally! [mean laugh]

Aladdin: [Aladdin struggles] What are you doing?

Old Man Jafar: I give you your reward. [Old Man Jafar's voice returns to normal Jafar's voice] Your eternal reward. [Abu then bites his hand, then screams]

[screams]

[roaring as the cave collapses]

Jafar: [laughing] It's mine. [removes his disguise] It's all mine. I... Where is he? Now... NOOOOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!!!!

Sultan: Jasmine? Oh my dear. What's wrong?

Jasmine: [sniffling] Jafar...did something terrible.

Sultan: There, there, my dear. We will make things right. Now tell me everything.

Abu: Oh. Aladdin. Wake up. Aladdin.

Aladdin: Ah! My head. Were trapped. This two-faced son of a jackal! [snarling] Whoever it was, he's long gone with that lamp.

Abu: Aha!

Aladdin: [laughing] Well, you little hairy thief. It looks like dilapidated, worthless scrap metal.
Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to understand.

Genie: Wow! Hey! 10,000 years will give you such a stiff neck. Wait a second. Wow! WOW!!! Does it feel good to be outside?
I tell you, glad to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hi. Where do you come from? What is your name?

Aladdin: Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

Genie: Aladdin. Hello Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Can we call you "Al"? Or maybe just “Din”. And “Laddie”?
They'd say, "Here, boy. Come on, Laddie."
Aladdin: I must have hit my head harder than I thought.

Genie: Do you smoke? Do you mind if I do? [laughing] Oh, sorry, Cheetah. I hope I didn't burn the fur. Yo, Rugman. I haven't seen you in a few millennia.
Give me some pompom. Yeah. Eh eh. Say, you are much smaller than my former master. Either that or I get fat. Look aside.
Do I seem different to you?

Aladdin: Wait a minute. I am your master ?

Genie: That's right. He can be educated. What would you wish for me? The always impressive, the long content, often imitated, but never duplicated... [echoing]
Duplicated, duplicated... Genius... of the Lamp! Right here, straight from the lamp, right here for your dearest wishes to come true. THANKS.

Aladdin: Wow. Wish fulfillment?

Genie: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-no about wishing for more wishes. That's it. Three. Uno, dos, tres. Now substitutions, exchanges or refunds.

Aladdin: Now I know I'm dreaming.

Genie: Master, I don't think you really realize what you have here! So why not just ruminate while I illuminate the possibilities. ♪

Abu: [chattering] Huh? [groans]

Genie: So what will happen, Master?

Aladdin: You're going to grant me the three wishes I want, aren't you?

Genie: Ah, almost. There are some reservations, some considerations.

Aladdin: Like?

Genie: Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anyone. So don't ask. Rule number two! I can't make someone fall in love with someone else. Mwah!
You're a little punisher there. Rule number three! I can't bring people back to life. It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing that!! Other than that, you have it.

Aladdin: Hmm.

Abu: Oh!

Aladdin: Any reservations? Do you mean the limits? On wishes? An all-powerful genius. I can't even bring people back to life.
I don't know, Abu. He probably won't even be able to get us out of this cave. Looks like we're going to have to find a way out.

Genie: Excuse me? Are you looking at me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up? Did you bring me here? And all of a sudden you let me down?
I don't think so, not at the moment. You get your wishes, so sit down!!!

[Abou shouts]

Genius: In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, anywhere. Keep your hands and arms inside the mat. We're... out of here!

Sultan: Jafar, it's a scandal. If it weren't for all your years of loyal service...
From now on, you must discuss with me the sentencing of the prisoners, before they are beheaded.

Jafar: I assure you, Your Highness, this will not happen again.

Sultan: Jasmine...Jafar. Now, let's leave all this complicated matter behind us. Please.

Jafar: My most abject and humble apologies, princess.

Jasmine: At least there will be some good if I'm forced to marry. When I'm queen, I'll have the power to get rid of you.

[Jafar laughs nervously]

Sultan: It's nice. So everything was settled. Now, Jasmine, back to this suitor thing...Jasmine? Jasmine!

Jafar: [groans] If only I had that lamp!

Iago: [imitates Jasmine] "I will have the power to get rid of you." [groaning, returns to normal voice]
To think we have to keep kissing this idiot and his idiot daughter for the rest of our lives...

Jafar: Now, Iago. Only until she finds an idiot husband. Then she'll get us banned. Or beheaded.

Both: Eeek..

Iago: Oh. Wait a minute! Jafar! What if you were the idiot husband?

Jafar: What?
-
Iago: Okay, you marry the princess, okay? And then, you become the sultan!

Jafar: Oh... Marry the shrew... I become the sultan... The idea has merit.

Iago: Yes, deserve it! Yes! And then we drop the step-daddy and the little wife off a cliff. Yeah! Kersplat!

Jafar: [evil laughs] I like the way your dirty little mind works.

Genius: Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet for all your travel needs. Do not stand until the treadmill has completely stopped.
THANKS. Goodbye now. Good yes. THANKS. Bye. Well, what do you think, doubting Mr. Mustafa?

Aladdin: Oh, you showed me that well. Now, about my three wishes.

Genie: Are my ears deceiving me? Three? You're down ONE, boy!

Aladdin: Ah, now. I never really wanted to leave the cave. You did it alone.

Genie: [jaw drops] Well, I'm feeling sheepish. Fine, you baaad boy, but now no more presents.

Aladdin: Fair deal. So three wishes. I want them to be good. What would you like?

Genie: Me? I've been asked that before. Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

Aladdin: What?

Genie: Now I can't. I...

Aladdin: Come in. Tell me.

Genius: Freedom.

Aladdin: Are you a prisoner?

Genie: This is all part and parcel of the whole genie gig. Phenomenal cosmic powers... A very small living space.

Aladdin: Genius, it's terrible.

Genie: But, oh, to be free. No need to say, “Phew. What do you need ? Poof. What do you need ? Poof. What do you need ?
To be my own master. Such a thing would be greater than all the magic and treasures in the world! But what am I talking about?
Let's be real here. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. Genius, wake up and smell the hummus.

Aladdin: Why not?

Genie: The only way I can get out of this is if my master wants me to leave. So you can guess how often this happened.

Aladdin: I will. I will free you.

Genie: Uh-huh, yeah, that's right.

Aladdin: Now, truly, I promise. After I make my first two wishes, I will use my third wish to free you.

Genie: Well, I hope so. All right. Let's make magic! So what is it? What do you want most?

Aladdin: Well, there's this girl.

Genius: False. I can't make someone fall in love, remember?

Aladdin: Oh, but Genie, she's smart and funny and...

Genie: Pretty?

Aladdin: Magnificent. She has these fair eyes and hair. Wow. And his smile... [sighs]

Genie: Friend... It's love.

Aladdin: But she's the princess. To have a chance, I would have to be... Hey, can you make me a prince?

Genie: Let's see here. Royal chicken? No. Alaskan king crab. Ouch! I hate it when they do that. Cesar salad. Ah! And you, Brute? NOW!
Ah! “Make a prince.” Is this an official wish? Say the magic words.

Aladdin: Genie, I wish you would make me a prince.

Genie: Very good! Eh eh ! Frame! Frame! Firstly, this fez and waistcoat combination is way too third century. These fixes. What are we trying to say, beggar?
NOW. Let's work with me here. Ooh. I like this. Very macho. Now he needs something else. What does that tell me? It's about mode of transportation.
Excuse me, little monkey. Whose. This way.

Iago: Awk. The problem with your daughter.

Sultan: Oh, really?

Jafar: Right here. “If the princess has not chosen a husband at the appointed time, then the sultan will choose for her.”

Sultan: But Jasmine hated all these suitors. How could I choose someone she hates?

Jafar: Do not worry, my liege. There is more. "If ever a suitable prince can be found",

Sultan: Jerk.

Jafar: "Then you have to marry a princess with..." Hmm... Interesting...

Sultan: What? WHO?

Jafar: The royal vizier. Well, that would be... me.

Sultan: But I thought the law said only a prince can marry a princess. I'm pretty sure...

Jafar: In desperate times, desperate measures call, my lord.

Sultan: Yes. Desperate measures.

Jafar: You will order the princess to marry me.

Sultan: I will order... the princess... to... But you are so old.

Jafar: The princess is going to marry me!!

Sultan: [clapping] Magnificent. Absolutely wonderful.

Aladdin: [clears throat] Your Majesty, I have come from afar to seek your daughter's hand.

Sultan: Prince Ali Ababwa. Of course. Nice to meet you. This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He too is delighted.

Jafar: Ecstatic. I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...

Aladdin: Ababwa.

Jafar: It doesn't matter. You can't just scroll here uninvited and expect...

Sultan: By Allah, this is a truly remarkable device. Ooh. I don't think I could...

Aladdin: Well, certainly, Your Majesty. Allow me.

Jafar: Sire, I must advise you against this.

Sultan: Oh, button up, Jafar. Learn to have a little fun.

Iago: Ouch, ouch, ouch.

Sultan: Ahh! Wow! Attention! I'm coming!

Jafar: Where did you say you were from?

Aladdin: Oh, much further than you have traveled, I'm sure.

Jafar: Try me.

Sultan: Watch out, Polly.

Iago: Hey, look at this. Look at him with that stupid rug. Ah! Phew!

Sultan: Walk away. I'm coming to land. Jafar, look at this.

Jafar: Spectacular, Your Highness.

Sultan: It was lovely. Yes, I see I have a talent for that. This is a very impressive youth. And a prince at that.
[whispers] If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all.

Jafar: I don't trust him, Sire.

Sultan: This is absurd. One thing I'm proud of, Jafar, I'm an excellent judge of character.

Iago: Oh, excellent judge. Yes of course. Not!

Sultan: Jasmine will like this one.

Aladdin: And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine.

Jafar: Your Highness, now. I must intercede on behalf of Jasmine. This boy is no different from the others. What makes him think he is worthy of the princess?

Aladdin: Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa. Just let her meet me. I will win your daughter.

Jasmine: How dare you. You all. Stay to decide my future? I am not a prize to be won.

Sultan: Oh, my dear. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just give Jasmine time to calm down.

Jafar: I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince Abooboo.

Aladdin: [Aladdin sighs] What am I going to do? Jasmine won't even let me talk to her. I should have known I couldn't make this stupid prince wish come true.

[snarl]

Genie: Then move. Hey. It's a good decision. I can not believe it. I lose to an all-in.

Aladdin: Genie, I need help.

Genie: All right, Sparky, here's the deal. If you want to woo the little lady, you have to be a maverick. Did you get it?

Aladdin: What?

Genie: Tell him the truth!

Aladdin: No way. If Jasmine found out I was really a dirty street rat, she would make fun of me.

Genius: A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh. Al, joking aside, you really should be yourself.

Aladdin: Hey, that's the last thing I want to be. Okay, I'll go see her. I just... I have to be smooth, cool, confident. What do I look like?

Genie: Like a prince.

[sighs]

Aladdin: Princess Jasmine?

[snarl]

Jasmine: Who's there?

Aladdin: It's me, Prince Ali. Hmm. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

Jasmine: I don't want to see you.

Aladdin: No, no, please, princess. Give me a chance.

Rajah: (Grunt)

Jasmine: Leave me alone.

Aladdin: Down, kitty.

Genie: So, how's your boyfriend?

Aladdin: Good kitty, take off.

[Rajah growls]

Aladdin: Down, kitty.

Jasmine: Wait. Wait. I know you?

Aladdin: Uh, now. NOW.

Jasmine: You remind me of someone I met in the market.

Aladdin: The market? I have servants who go to the market for me. Well, I even have servants who go to the market for my servants.
SO. I couldn't have been me that you met.

Jasmine: No, I guess not.

Genie: Enough about you, Casanova. Talk about her. She's smart, funny, the hair, the eyes. Nothing. Choose a feature.

Aladdin: Hmm. Uh, Princess Jasmine? You are very...

Genius: Wonderful, magnificent, punctual.

Aladdin: ...punctual.

Jasmine: Punctual?

Genie: Sorry.

Aladdin: Uh, beautiful.

Genius: Great recovery.

Jasmine: Hmm. I'm rich too, you know.

Aladdin: Yeah.

Jasmine: The daughter of a sultan.

Aladdin: I know.

Jasmine: A great reward for any prince to marry.

Aladdin: Um, that's true. RIGHT. A prince like me.

Genie: Watch out! Warning!

Jasmine: That’s true. A prince like you. And every other stuffed shirt, swaggering peacock I've ever met.

Genie: Mayday! Help!

Jasmine: Go jump off the balcony!

Aladdin: What?

Genie: Stop her. Stop her! Do you want me to poke her?

Aladdin: Get out.

Genie: Okay, great. But remember, “bee” yourself.

Aladdin: Yeah, that's true.

Jasmine: What?

Aladdin: Uh... Uh, you're right. [sighs] You're not just a prize to be won. You should be free to make your own choices. I will leave now.

Jasmine: Now!

Aladdin: What? What?

Jasmine: How... How do you do that?

Aladdin: It's a flying carpet.

Jasmine: That’s lovely.

[The carpet “kisses” his hand]

Aladdin: You, uh... You don't want to go for a ride, do you? We could leave the palace, see the world.

Jasmine: Is it safe?

Aladdin: Of course. Do you trust me?

Aladdin: Jasmine, I'm sorry.

Jasmine: Did you think I was stupid?

Aladdin: Now.

Jasmine: Wouldn't that be enough?

Aladdin: Now. I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't. Now, that's not what I meant.

Jasmine: Who are you? Tell me the truth.

Aladdin: The truth. The truth. Um... The truth is... I sometimes dress like a commoner, uh... to escape the pressures of palace life. But I really am a prince.

Jasmine: Why didn't you tell me?

Aladdin: Well, you know... royalty going out on the town in disguise seems a bit strange, don't you think?

Jasmine: Hmm. Not so strange. Good night, my handsome prince.

Aladdin: Sleep well, princess. [sigh] Yes! [sighs] For the first time in my life, things are starting to go well.

[screaming, struggling]

Aladdin: Hey! [muffled] Abu. Abu.

Guard: Hold him.

Jafar: I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo.

Aladdin: [muffled] Why, you...

Jafar: Make sure he's never found.

[laughing]

Genius: Never fail. Get into the bath and scrub the lamp. Good morning? Al? [gasping] Al! Kid, stop.
You can't cheat on this one. I can't help you unless you make a wish. You have to say, “Genius, I want you to save my life. " Got it?
All right! Come on, Aladdin! I take that as a yes. [simulating an alarm] Raise the range. [babbling in German]

[to cough]

Genie: Don't scare me like that.

Aladdin: Genie, I, uh... I... Thank you, Genie.

Genie: Oh, Al. I'm starting to like you, kid. Not that I want to pick out curtains or anything.

[buzzing]

Sultan: Jasmine.

Jasmine: Oh, Father, I just had the most wonderful time. I am so happy.

Sultan: You should be, Jasmine. I chose a husband for you.

Jasmine: What?

Sultan: You will marry Jafar.

[panting]

Jafar: You are speechless, I see. A great quality in a wife.

Jasmine: I will never marry you. Father, I choose Prince Ali.

Jafar: Prince Ali is gone.

Aladdin: You better check your crystal ball again, Jafar.

Jasmine: Prince Ali!

[panting]

Iago: What do you mean... uh. Awk!

Aladdin: Tell him the truth, Jafar. You tried to have me killed.

Jafar: What? Ridiculous, absurd, Your Highness. He's obviously lying.

Sultan: Obviously liar.

Jasmine: Father, what's wrong with you?

Aladdin: I know what's wrong.

(Aladdin breaks Jafar's serpent staff)

Sultan: Oh, my God!

Aladdin: Your Highness. Jafar controls you with this.

Sultan: [stammering] What? Jafar? You, traitor!

Jafar: Your Majesty, this can all be explained.

Sultan: Guards! Guards!

Iago: Well, that's all. Were dead. Forget that. Just dig a grave for both of us. Were dead.

Sultan: Arrest Jafar immediately.

[in trouble]

Jafar: It's not done yet, boy. [laughing]

[to cough]

Sultan: Find him! Search everywhere!

Aladdin: Jasmine, are you okay?

Jasmine: Yes.

Sultan: Jafar, my most trusted advisor, has been plotting against me all this time. It's horrible, just horrible. How am I going to... Huh?
Could this be true? My daughter has finally chosen a suitor? Ha, ha! Praise Allah! You brilliant boy, I could kiss you. I will not do it. I leave that to my...
But you will be married at the same time. Yes yes. And you will be happy and prosperous, and then you, my boy, will become sultan.

Aladdin: Sultan?

Sultan: Yes. An honest young man like you, a person of impeccable moral character, that's exactly what this kingdom means.

Iago: We have to get out of here. We have to get out. I need to start packing up Your Highness. Only the essentials.
We have to travel light and bring guns, weapons, knives, and what do you think of this photo? I don't know, I think I'm making a weird face with that.

[maniacal laughter]

Iago: Oh, boy. It's cracked. He became crazy. Jafar! Jafar! Have a grip! Good adhesion.

Jafar: Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged kid, Aladdin. He has the lamp, Iago.

Iago: Well, this wretch...

Jafar: But you will relieve him.

Iago: Me?

Aladdin: Sultan? They want me to be Sultan?

Genie: Huzzah! ♪ Hail the conquering hero! ♪ [♪ Stars and Stripes Forever plays] Aladdin, you have just won the princess's heart. What are you going to do next?

[sighs deeply]

Genie: [whispering] Psst. Your sentence is: "I will release the genie." Anytime.

Aladdin: Genius, I can't.

Genie: Of course you can. You simply say: “Genius, I wish you freedom. »

Aladdin: I'm serious! Listen, I'm sorry. I am really! But they want to make me a sultan. No, they want to make Prince Ali a sultan. Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

Genie: Al, you win.

Aladdin: Because of you! The only reason people think I'm worth anything is because of you! What if they find out I'm not really a prince?
What if Jasmine found out? I would lose it. Genius, I can't do this alone. I can't wish you freedom.

Genie: Very good. I understand. After all. You lied to everyone. Hey, I was starting to feel left out. Now, if you will excuse me, Master.

[sighs]

Aladdin: Genie, I'm so sorry.

[raspberry]

Aladdin: Well, very good! So... stay in there! What are you guys looking at?

[moaning, sniffling]

Aladdin: Look, I...I'm sorry. Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't... Wait. Come on. [sigh] What do I do? [sigh] Genie is right. I have to tell Jasmine the truth.

Jasmine: Ali. Oh, Ali. Will you come here?

Aladdin: [sighs] Well, there you go. Jasmine? Where are you?

Iago: [imitates Jasmine] In the menagerie. Hurry up.

Aladdin: I'm coming.

Iago: Do ​​you have a problem, Pinky? Jerk. [happy snicker] Boy, Jafar is going to be happy to see you. [imitates Jafar] Excellent work, Iago. Oh, keep going.
[imitating Jafar] No, really. On a scale of one to ten, you're an eleven. Oh, Jafar, you are so kind. I am embarrassed. I'm blushing.

Sultan: People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a suitor.

[crowd cheers]

Aladdin: Jasmine.

Jasmine: Ali, where have you been?

Aladdin: Jasmine, there is something I need to tell you.

Jasmine: The whole kingdom was present for Father's announcement.

Aladdin: No. But, Jasmine, please listen to me. You do not understand...

Jasmine: Good luck.

Sultan: Ali Ababwa!

Iago: Now look at them, they're cheering for that little idiot!

Jafar: Let them applaud...

Genie: You know, Al, I'm really getting...! I don't think you're him. Tonight, the role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister man.

Jafar: I am your master now!

Genie: I was afraid of that.

Jafar: Genie, grant me my first wish. I wish to reign on high as sultan!

Aladdin: Wow!

Sultan: Bless my soul. What is this? What? What is this? What is going on? Oh, my God, what's happening?

Jasmine: Father!

Aladdin: Genius, now!

Genie: Sorry, kid. I have a new master now.

Sultan: Jafar, I order you to stop.

Jafar: Ah, but there is a new order now. My command. Finally, you will bow to me!

Jasmine: We will never bow to you!

Iago: Why am I not surprised?!

Jafar: If you don't bow to a sultan, then you will cower to a sorcerer!! Genie, my second wish... I wish to be the most powerful wizard in the world!

Ah, Salaam and good evening
to you, worthy friend.
Please, please come closer.
Too close. A little too close.
There.
Welcome to Agrabah,
mysterious city,
of enchantment,
and the best merchandise on this side
of the Jordan, on sale today.
Look at this. Yes.
Hookah and coffee maker combination.
Also makes julienne fries.
Will not break. Will not...
It broke.
Ohh! Look at this.
I've never seen
one of them was previously intact.
This is the famous
Tupperware from the Dead Sea.
Listen. Ah, still good.
Wait. Do not go.
I can see you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.
I think then you would be
most rewarded for considering this.
Don't be fooled
by its banal appearance.
Like so many things,
it's not what's outside,
but what matters inside.
This is no ordinary lamp.
Once it changed the course
of the life of a young man.

was more than it seemed.

but I got it.
Ah-ah-ahhh.
The treasure.
Ouch!
Trust me, my spicy friend.
- You will get what you expect.
- What's wrong. Awk!
Quickly! Follow the trail.
Faster.
Finally, after all
my years of research...
the Cave of Wonders.
Ok. Cave of Wonders.
By Allah.
Now remember.
Bring me the lamp.
The rest of the treasure
is yours, but the lamp is mine.
Oh, the lamp. Oh, the lamp.
Damn, where did you dig
this bozo standing?
Shh.
Who disturbs my sleep?
It's me, Gazeem,
a humble thief.
Know this.
Only one can enter here,
the one whose value lies far away.
A diamond in the rough.
What are you waiting for#Continue.
No!
Looking for you
the rough diamond.
I can not believe it.
I just don't believe it.
We will never get
a take on that stupid lamp.
Forget that.
Look at this.
I'm so angry I'm molting.
Patience, Lake. Patience.
Gazeem obviously wasn't worth it.
Oh, there's a big surprise.
I think I'm having a heart attack
and die from this surprise.
What are we going to do?
We have a big problem here, a big...
Yes.
Only one can enter.
I have to find this one, this one...
rough diamond.
Stop! Thief!
Stop! Thief!
I will have your hands

All that for a loaf of bread?
Wow!

Do you think it was easy?
You two, over there,

Getting into trouble a little early
today, isn't it, Aladdin?
Worry. Certainly not. You are only

#I only steal what I can't afford#
That's all.
#A step ahead of the lawmen#
#That's it and it's not a joke#
#These guys don't like that I'm broke#
- The scum.
- Street rat.
- Scoundrel.
- Take that.
#Just a little snack, guys#
#Tear It Up
Take it back, guys#
#I can understand a clue
I have to face the facts#
- #You are my only friend, Abu#
- WHO?
#Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom#
#He became a single man to increase crime#
#I would blame the parents
Except he doesn't have them#
#I have to eat to live
I have to steal to eat#
#I tell you everything
When I had time#
#A jump ahead of slowpokes
One step ahead of my loss#
#Next time I will use a pen name#
Here it is.
#A leap ahead of the hitmen
One step ahead of the herd#
#I think I'm going for a walk
Around the block#
- Stop, thief.
- Vandal.
- Abu!
- Scandal.
#Let's not be in too much of a hurry#
#But I think it's pretty tasty#
#I have to eat to live
I have to steal to eat#
#Otherwise we would get along well#
Fake.
Grab it!
He has a sword!
You are idiots.
We all have swords.
- #A jump ahead of the beating of hooves#
- Vandal!
- #A jump before the bump#
- Street rat!
- #One thing before the disaster#
- Scoundrel!
#They are fast, but I am much faster#
#There you go, I better throw my hand in#
# Wish me a safe landing
All I have to do is jump#
Yuck! Hey!
And now, esteemed effendi, we enjoy ourselves.
All right.
Yum yum!
Uh-oh.
Here. Keep on going. Take it.
Oh no. Eh?
On the way to the palace, I suppose.
Another suitor for the princess.
- Get out of my way, you brats.
Hey!
If I were as rich as you,
I could indulge in certain manners.
Oh. I'm going to teach you some manners.
Look at that, Abu.
It's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.
Ooh!
You are a worthless street rat.
You were born a street rat,
you will die like a street rat,
and only your fleas will cry for you.
I'm not worth anything.
And I don't have fleas.
Come on, Abu.
Let's go home.
#Riffraff, street rat#
#I don't buy this#
#If only they looked closer#
#Would they see a poor boy#
#No, Sire#
#They would find out#
#There is so much more#
#Tome#
One day, Abu,
things will change.
We will be rich, live in a palace,
and I never had any problems at all.
I have never been so insulted.
Oh, Prince Ahmed.
You're not leaving that early, are you?
Good luck marrying her.
Oh! Jasmine.
Jasmine!
Jasmine!
- Jasmine!
It's fucked up, Rajah.
This is why Prince Ahmed
slammed.
Oh, Father.
Rajah was just playing with him.
Isn't that right, Rajah?
you were just playing
with that too dressed,
The egocentric Prince Ahmed,
is not it ?
Dearest, you need to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes calling.
The law says
you must be married to a prince...
before your next birthday.
The law is false.
You only have three days left.
Father, I hate being forced to do this.
If I get married,
I want it to be out of love.
Jasmine...
it's not just this law.
I'm not going to be here forever,
well, I...
I just want to be sure
you are taken care of.
Foreseen.
Please try to understand.
I've never done anything on my own.
I never had real friends.
Except you, Rajah.
I've never even been there
outside the palace walls.
But, Jasmine, you are a princess.
So maybe I don't want
be more of a princess.
Oooh! I...I...
Allah forbids you from doing so
have daughters.
Hmm?
I don't know where she got that from.
His mother wasn't that picky.
Oh! Ah, Jafar.
My most trusted advisor.
I desperately need your wisdom.
My life is only to serve you, my lord.
It's this business of suitors.
Jasmine refuses
choose a husband.
- I'm at the end of my nerves.
- Ah OK ! End of the rope!
Oh!
Have a biscuit, pretty Polly.
Your Majesty certainly
makes sense with stupid animals.
NOW,
maybe I can guess a solution
to this thorny problem.
If anyone can help, it's you.
But this would require the use
of the mystical blue diamond.
Oh. Uh, my ring?
But it's been in the family for years.
We need to find
the princess a suitor.
Don't worry.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
The diamond.
Here, Jafar.
Everything you need will be fine.
You are very kind, my lord.
Now run and play
with your little toys, eh?
Yes. It will be pretty good.
I can not stand it anymore !
If I have to choke on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...
Boom! Beat!
Calm down, Lago.
Then I grabbed him by the head.
Beat!
Soon I will be sultan,
not this stupid idiot.
And then I stuff the crackers
in his throat.
Ha, ha!
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.
But I can't stay here
and let my life be lived for me.
I'll miss you.
Bye.
Okay, Abu. Go.
Try that. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.
Get your paws off that.
Why you...
Get out of here,
you damned, dirty monkey!
Bye.
Well done, Abu.
Breakfast is served.
Pretty lady, buy a pot.
There is no finer pot in brass or silver.
Sugar dates.
Sweet dates and figs.
Sweet dates and pistachios.
Would the lady like a necklace?
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.
Fresh fish!
We catch them, you buy them!
Oh no. I do not think so.
Oh!
Excuse me.
I'm really, really sorry.
Wow.
Uh-oh.
Good morning. Good morning?
Oh, you must be hungry.
Here is.
You better be able to pay for that.
Pay?
No one steals my basket.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I have no money.
- Thief!
- Please...
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the Sultan.
You know what
the penalty is for theft?
No! No, please!
Thank you sir.
I'm so glad you found it.
I looked for you everywhere.
- What are you doing?
- Play the game.
You know this girl ?
Unfortunately yes. She is my sister.
She's a little crazy.
She said she knew the Sultan.
She thinks the monkey is the sultan.
O wise Sultan, how can I serve you?
Tragic, isn't it?
But no harm is done.
Now come, sister.
It's time to go see the doctor.
Oh, hello, doctor.
How are you doing?
- No no no. Not this one.
- Come on, Sultan.
Eh. What?
Come back here, you little thieves!
With all my respect,
Your rottenness,
couldn't we just wait
for a real storm?
Save your breath, Lago. Faster.
Yes, oh mighty Evil One.
Gone, sands of time.
Reveal me the one
who can enter the cave.
Yes! Yes!
Here it is.
My diamond in the rough.
It's him. It's the clown
We were waiting?
Let the guards extend it
an invitation to the palace, okay?
Swell.
Almost there.
I want to thank you
for arresting this man.
Uh, forget it.
So it's your first time
on the market, huh?
Is it so obvious?
Well, you kind of stand out.
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.
Hmm. I learn fast.
Wow.
Hey.
Come on. This way.
Wow. Watch your head there.
Be careful.
Is this where you live?
Yeah. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.
This looks fabulous.
Well, it's not much,
but there is a superb view.
Wow. The palace looks
Quite surprising, huh?
Oh, it's wonderful.
I wonder what it would be like
it's as if I lived there,
and they have servants and servants.
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.
It's better than here.
You're always looking for food
and dodge the guards.
You are not free to do
your own choices.
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...
...trap.
So where are you from?
What does it matter?
I ran away
and I won't go back.
Really. How come?
Why you...
My father forces me
to marry.
It's... it's horrible.
Abu!
What?
Abu says, uh...
it is not fair.
What?
- Oh that's right ?
- Yes, of course.
And Abu
do you have anything else to say?
Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.
Oh man.
Hmm.
Tell him it's very nice.
There you are.
- They're after me! You?
- It was my father who must have sent them...
- Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
- Yes...
So jump!
We continue to cross paths,
Isn't that right, street rat?
Run! Go! Get out of here!
Take this thing away from me!
- This is the dungeon for you, boy.
- Let me go.
Let him go.
- Look here, men. A street mouse.
Let it go,
by order of the princess.
Princess Jasmine.
- Princess?
- Princess?
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.
It's not your problem.
Do as I command. Free him.
I will, princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.
- You will have to discuss it with him.
- Believe me, I will.
Jafar?
Oh, princess.
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.
How can I be of help to you?
The guards just took a boy
of the market, on your orders.
Your father accused me
with the maintenance of peace in Agrabah.
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?
I can't breathe, Jafar.
Why, by kidnapping the princess,
Of course.
If you could just...
Ah! It hurts!
He didn't kidnap me.
I ran away.
Oh dear.
Oh, how terribly upsetting.
If I had known...
What do you mean?
Unfortunately, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.
Which sentence ?
The death.
- By beheading.
- No.
I am extremely sorry, princess.
How can you?
So how did it go?
I think she took it pretty well.
It's all my fault, Rajah.
- I didn't even know his name.
She was the princess.
I can not believe it.
I must have looked
so stupid for her.
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin!
Good morning!
Abu. Here.
Come on, help me out of this.
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Don't worry.
I will never see her again.
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there is a law.
She must marry a prince.
- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!
I'm stupid.
You're just a fool
if you give up, boy.
Who are you?
A humble prisoner, like you.
But together,
maybe we can be more.
I listen.
There is a cave, my boy,
a cave of wonders,
full of treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.
Ooh!
A treasure enough to impress even
your princess, I'll bet.
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I die here.
But the law says that only a prince can...
You've heard of the golden rule,
is not it ?
The one with the gold
makes the rules.
Why would you share all this
a wonderful treasure with me?
I need a young pair of legs and
a strong back to pursue him.
Um, one problem.
It is over there.
We are here.
Uh-uh. Things are not always
what they seem.
SO...
do we have a deal?
Oh, I don't know.
Who disturbs my sleep?
Uh, it's me, Aladdin.
Proceed.
Do not touch anything except the lamp.
Remember, my boy,
bring me the lamp first,
and then you will have to
have your reward.
Come on, Abu.
Can you watch this!
Just a handful of these things
would make me richer than the sultan.
Abu!
Don't... touch... anything.
We need to find this lamp.
Eh?
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you stop him?
Abu, what are you, crazy?
A magic carpet.
Come on. To go out.
We're not going to hurt you.
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not going to bite.
THANKS.
Wait a minute. Do not go.
Maybe you can help us.
Hey! Wow!
You see, we try
to find this lamp.
I think he knows where it is.
Wait here.
Oh!
That's it?
This is what we came for
all the way here to...
Abu! No!
- Infidels!
- Oh oh.
You touched
the forbidden treasure!
Now you'll never do it again
see the day !
Wow!
Help! Help! Help!
I got you!
Carpet, let's move.
Abu!
Abu, now is not the time to panic.
Start panicking.
Wow!
- Help me.
- Throw me the lamp.
I can't hold on.
Give me your hand.
Give me the lamp first.
Yes!
Finally!
What are you doing?
Give you your reward.
Your eternal reward.
It's mine.
It's all mine.
I... where is he?
No.
No!
Jasmine?
Oh my dear.
What's wrong?
Jafar has...
did something terrible.
There, there, my dear.
We will make things right.
Now tell me everything.
Oh.
Aladdin. Wake up.
Aladdin.
Oh! My head.
Were trapped.
This two-faced son of a jackal!
Whoever he is,
he's been gone a long time with that lamp.
Ah!
Well, you hairy little thief.
It looks like such a beating,
worthless junk.
Hey, I think there is
something written here,
but it's difficult to understand.
Aaaaahhhhh!
Hey!
, the years will give you
such a stiff neck.
Wait a second.
Wow! Wow!
Does it feel good
be out of there.
Glad to be back,
Ladies and gentlemen.
Hi. Where do you come from?
What is your name?
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.
Aladdin. Hello Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.
Can we call you "Al"?
Or maybe just “Din”.
And “Laddie”?
They'd say, "Here, boy. Come on, Laddie."
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.
Do you smoke? Do you mind if I do?
Oh, sorry, Cheetah.
I hope I didn't burn the fur.
Yo, Rugman. I did not see you
in a few millennia.
Give me some pompom.
Yeah. Eh eh.
Say, you are much smaller
as my last master.
Or maybe I'm getting bigger.
Look aside. Do I look different?
Wait a minute.
I am your master ?
That's right. He can be educated.
What would you wish for me?
The always impressive,
long content,
often imitated,
but never duplicated...
Duplicated, duplicated...
Genius...
of the Lamp!
Right here, straight from the lamp,
right here for your
lots of wish fulfillment.
THANKS.
Wow. Wish fulfillment?
Three wishes to be exact.
And ix-no on the wish
for more wishes.
That's it. Three.
Uno, dos, tres.
No substitutions,
exchanges or refunds.
Now I know I'm dreaming.
Master, I don't think you really realize
what you have here.
So why not just ruminate
while I shine
the possibilities.
#Well, Ali Baba had these thieves#
#Scheherazade had a thousand stories#
#But, master, you are lucky
Because you rolled up your sleeves#
#You have a brand of magic that never fails#
#You have power in your corner now#
#Some heavy ammunition in your camp#
#You got punch and punch
Yahoo and how#
#See, all you have to do
It's rub this lamp and I'll say#
#Mr. Aladdin, sir,
What will be your pleasure#
#Let me take your order
Rate it#
#You never had a friend like me#
#Life is your restaurant
And I'm your butler
#Come on, whisper whatever you want#
#You never had a friend like me#
#Yes sir
We pride ourselves on service#
#You are the boss, the king, the shah#
#Say what you want
It's yours, real dish#
#How about some more baklava#?
#Have some of Column A
Try the whole column B#
#I'm in the mood to help you, man#
#You never had a friend like me#
#Oh my#
#No no#
#Oh dear#
#Can your friends do this#?
#Can your friends do this#?
#Can your friends shoot this#
#He took out his little hat#?
#Can your friends go poof#?
Hey, look here. Haha!
#Can your friends go
Abracadabra, let it rip#
#And then make that sucker disappear#
#So don't just sit there
Soft jaw, wild eyes#
#I am here to answer
All your midnight prayers#
#You have certified me in good faith#
#You are a genius
For your business manager#
#I have a strong desire to help you#
#So what is your wish
I really want to know#
#You have a list
It's probably three miles long#
#All you have to do is rub like this#
#Mr. Aladdin, sir
I have a wish or two or three#
#I'm at work, big mogul#
#You never had a friend
I never had a friend#
#You never had a friend
I never had a friend#
#You never are#
#I had a#
#Friend#
#As#
#Me#
Ah ha ha!
Wah ha ha!
#You never had a friend like me#
Eh?
So what's it going to be, Master?
You will grant me
three wishes I want, right?
Oh, almost.
There are some reservations,
some compensations.
As?
Ah, rule number one:
I can't kill anyone.
So don't ask.
Rule number two.
I can't make anyone
fall in love with someone else.
You're a little punisher there.
Rule number three. I can't bring
people come back from the dead.
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing that.
Other than that, you have it.
- Hmm.
- Oh!
Reserves ?
Do you mean the limits?
On wishes?
An all-powerful genius.
I can't even bring people
back from the dead.
I don't know, Abu. It is probably
I can't even get us out of this cave.
Looks like we're going to have to
find a way out.
Excuse me?
Are you looking at me?
Did you rub my lamp?
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?
And you let me down?
I do not think so,
not immediately.
You get your wishes,
so sit down!
- In case of emergency,
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.
Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.
Were...
out of here!
Jafar, it's a scandal.
If it wasn't for all your years
good and loyal service...
From now on you need to discuss
condemnation of the prisoners with me,
before they were decapitated.
I assure you, Your Highness,
this won't happen again.
Jasmine...
Jafar. Let's put it all
complicated matters behind us.
Please.
My most abject and humble apologies
you too, princess.
At least some good will come
that I was forced to marry.
When I am queen, I will have
the power to get rid of you.
It's good.
So everything was settled.
Now, Jasmine, let's get back to
this suitor thing...Jasmine?
Jasmine!
If only I had had this lamp.
"I will have the power
to get rid of you. »
Think
we have to keep kissing
to this idiot
and his stupid daughter
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, Lake.
Only until she finds
a stupid husband.
Then she'll get us banned.
Or beheaded.
Eww!
Oh. Wait a minute.
Jafar. And if you were
the idiot husband?
What?
Okay, you're getting married
princess, okay?
And, uh, then you
become the sultan.
Oh.
Marry the shrew.
I become the sultan.
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, it deserves it. Yes.
And then we let stepfather down
and the little woman on the edge of a cliff.
Yeah !
Kersplat!
I like the way
your dirty little mind works.
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.
Don't stand to the mat
is completely stopped.
THANKS.
Goodbye now. Good yes.
THANKS.
Well how about this,
M. Do you doubt Mustafa?
Oh, you showed me that well.
Now, about my three wishes.
Are my ears deceiving me?
Three. You're one point behind, boy.
Oh no. I never really wished
to get out of the cave.
You did it alone.
Well, I feel sheepish.
Alright, you baaad boy,
but no more gifts.
Fair exchange.
So three wishes.
I want them to be good.
What would you like?
Me?
No one has ever asked me that before.
Well, in my case...
Ah, forget it.
- What?
- No I can not. I...
Come on. Tell me.
Freedom.
Are you a prisoner?
All this is an integral part
of the whole concert of genius.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
A very small living space.
Genius, this is terrible.
But, oh, to be free.
No need to go there,
“Phew. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"
To be my own master.
Such a thing would be
greater than all magic
and all the treasures
In the whole world.
But what am I talking about?
Let's be real here.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
Genius, wake up and smell the hummus.
Why not?
The only way for me to get out
that's if my master wants me to leave.
So you can guess how often
it happened.
I will do it. I will free you.
- Uh-huh, yeah, that's true.
- No, really, I promise.
after making my first two wishes,
I will use my third wish
to free you.
Well, I hope so.
All right.
Let's make magic.
So what is it?
What do you want most?
Well, there's this girl.
Fake.
I can't make anyone
falling in love, remember?
Oh, but, Genius,
she's smart and fun and...
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.
She has these eyes that...
and that hair. Wow.
And his smile...
Am I.
It's love.
But she's the princess.
To even have a chance,
I should be...
Hey, can you make me a prince?
Let's see here.
Royal chicken? No.
Alaskan king crab.
Ouch. I hate it when they do that.
Cesar salad. Ah!
And you, Brute. No.
Haha. “Make a prince.”
Is this an official wish?
Say the magic words.
Genius, I wish you
to make me a prince.
All right!
Eh eh ! Frame! Frame!
First up, this fez and vest combo
it's too much of the third century.
These fixes.
What are we trying to say, beggar?
No, let's work with me here.
Ooh. I like this. Very macho.
Now he needs something else.
What does that tell me?
It's about mode of transportation.
Excuse me, little monkey.
Whose. This way.
- Oh oh.
- Well here he is.
What better way to make your
entering the streets of Agrabah
than riding alone
brand new camel.
Attention. They spit.
Mmmm. Not enough.
It's still not enough.
Let's see.
What do you need?
Yes!
Esalalumbo Shimin Dumbo.
Wow!
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action.
Abu, you look good.
He has the outfit.
He has the elephant.
But we're not done yet.
Hold on to your turban, kid.
We're going to make you a star.
Sir, I found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.
Ok. The problem with your daughter.
Oh really?
Here.
"If the princess has not chosen
a husband at the appointed time,
then the sultan will have to
choose for her. »
But Jasmine hated
all these suitors.
How could I choose
someone she hates?
Don't worry, my lord.
There is more.
"if in the event
we cannot find a suitable prince,"
Jerk.
"a princess must then be married to..."
Hmm. Interesting.
What? WHO?
The royal vizier.
Well, that would be... me.
But I thought the law said
that only a prince
can marry a princess.
I'm pretty sure...
Desperate times call
desperate measures, my lord.
Yes. Desperate measures.
You will order
the princess to marry me.
I will order...
Princess...
has...
But you are so old.
The princess will marry me.
The princess is getting married...
- What. What is this?
This music.
Jafar, you must come
and see this.

Prince Ali Ababwa.
Of course.
Nice to meet you.
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He too is delighted.
Ecstatic.
- I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...
-Ababwa.
Never mind.
You can't just scroll here
uninvited and expect...
By Allah, it is absolutely
a remarkable device.
Ooh.
I don't think I could...
Well, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.
Sire, I must advise you against this.
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.
AIE Aie Aie.
Ahh! Wow!
Where did you say
where were you from?
Oh, much further than
you have traveled, I am sure.
- Try me.
- Be careful, Polly.
Hey, check this out.
Look at him with that stupid rug.
Ah!
Phew!
Out of the way.
I'm coming to land.
Jafar, look at this.
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- It was lovely.
Yes, it seems to me
have a talent for it.
This is a very impressive youth.
And a prince at that.
If we're lucky, you won't
I have to marry Jasmine after all.
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- It's absurd.
There is one thing I am proud of, Jafar,
I am an excellent judge of character.
Oh, excellent judge.
Yes of course. Not!
Jasmine will like this one.
And I'm pretty sure
I would like Princess Jasmine.
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on behalf of Jasmine.
This boy is no different
others.
What makes him think
Is he worthy of the princess?
Your Majesty,
I am Prince Ali Ababwa.
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.
How dare you.
You all. Standing around
decide on my future?
I am not a prize to be won.
Oh dear.
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine some time
cool.
I think it's time to say goodbye
to Prince Abouboo.
What will I do?
Jasmine won't even do it
let me talk to him.
I should have known I couldn't get out of this
this stupid prince wishes.
So get moving.
Hey.
It's a good decision.
I can not believe it.
I lose to an all-in.
Genius, I need help.
Alright, Sparky,
here's the deal.
If you want to go to court
the little lady,
you have to be
a straight shooter.
- Did you get it?
- What?
Tell him...
-...truth!
- Certainly not.
If Jasmine found out I was really
a dirty street rat,
she would make fun of me.
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.
Al, joking aside,
you really should be yourself.
Hey, that's the last thing I want to be.
Okay, I'll go see her.
I just... I have to be gentle,
cool, confident.
What do I look like?
Like a prince.
Princess Jasmine?
- Who is here?
- It's me, Prince Ali.
Hmm. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.
I do not want to see you.
No, no, please, princess.
Give me a chance.
- Leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.
So, how is our little friend?
Good kitty, take off.
Down, kitty.
Wait. Wait.
I know you?
Uh no. No.
You remind me of someone
I met in the market.
The marketplace?
I have servants who go
to the market for me.
Well, I even have servants who go to
the market for my servants.
It's not me you met.
No, I guess not.
Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.
She's smart, funny,
the hair, the eyes.
Nothing. Choose a feature.
Hmm. Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You are very...
- Wonderful, magnificent, punctual.
-...punctual.
- Punctual?
- Sorry.
- Um, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.
Hmm.
I'm rich too, you know.
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.
I know.
A great price
for a prince to marry.
Um, that's true. RIGHT.
A prince like me.
Warning! Warning!
RIGHT. A prince like you.
And all the other plush shirts,
swaggering peacock I met.
Help! Help!
Just gonna jump
a balcony!
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!
- Do you want me to sting her?
- Get out.
OK very good.
But remember, “bee” yourself.
- Yes indeed.
- What?
Um... Um, you're right.
You are not only
a prize to be won.
You should be free
to make your own choice.
I will leave now.
- No!
- What? What?
How...
How do you do this?
- It's a flying carpet.
- It's adorable.
You, uh...
You don't want to go
for a ride, right?
We could leave the palace,
see the world.
- Is it safe?
- Of course. Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
Yes.
Yes.
#I can show you the world#
#Brilliant, shimmering, splendid#
#Tell me, princess#
#Now when was the last time you did
Let your heart decide#
#I can open my eyes#
#Take yourself wonder by wonder#
#Above, Sideways and Below#
#On a magic carpet#
#An entirely new world#

I never knew#

It's crystal clear#

- Yeah.
It's a shame
Abu must have missed this.
No. He hates fireworks.
He doesn't like to fly either.
Um, that is to say, uh...
Oh no.
You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.
- Why did you lie?
-Jasmine, I'm sorry.
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.
- That I wouldn't understand?
- No.
I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.
Who are you?
Tell me the truth.
The truth?
The truth. Uh...
The truth is...
I sometimes dress like a commoner, uh...
to escape the pressures
of palace life.
But I really am a prince.
Why didn't you tell me?
Well you know...
royalty comes out
in the city disguised,
it seems a little strange,
you do not think ?
Hmm.
Not so strange.
Good night, my handsome prince.
Sleep well, princess.
Yes!
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go well.
Abu. Abu.
Hold it.
I'm afraid you're exhausted
welcome, Prince Abooboo.
Why you...
Make sure it's never found.
Never fail. Take the bath
and there is a problem with the lamp.
Good morning? Al?
Al! Kid, stop.
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help you unless you make a wish.
You must say: "Genius,
I want you to save my life." Understood?
Come on, Aladdin!
I take that as a yes.
Superior reach.
Don't scare me like that.
Genius, I, uh...
I...
-Thank you, Genie.
- Oh, Al.
I'm starting to like you, kid.
It's not that I want to choose
curtains or anything.
Jasmine.
Oh, Father, I just had
the most wonderful moment.
- I am so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.
I chose a husband for you.
- What?
- You will marry Jafar.
You are speechless, I see.
A great quality in a wife.
I will never marry you.
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali is gone.
Better check your
another crystal ball, Jafar.
Prince Ali!
How in the... uh. Awk!
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.
What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.
He's obviously lying.
Obviously lying.
Father, what is wrong with you?
I know what's wrong.
Oh my!
Jafar controls you with this.
What? Jafar?
You, traitor!
Your Majesty,
all this can be explained.
Guards! Guards!
Well that's it.
Were dead. Forget that.
Just dig a grave for both of us.
Were dead.
Stop Jafar immediately.
It's not done yet, boy.
Find it!
- Search everywhere!
-Jasmine, are you okay?
Yes.
Jafar, my most trusted advisor,
plotting against me all this time.
It's horrible, just horrible.
How will I ever...
Eh?
Could this be true?
My daughter finally
chosen a suitor?
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.
I will not do it.
I leave that to my...
But you will be married at the same time.
Yes yes. And you will be happy
and prosperous,
and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.
-Sultan?
- Yes.
A beautiful, honest young man
like you,
a person of yours
impeccable moral character
This is exactly what this kingdom needs.
We have to get out of here.
I need to start packing.
Only the essentials.
We have to travel light.
Bring the guns, the weapons,
and what do you think of this photo?
I think I'm making a weird face with that.
Oh man. It's cracked.
He became crazy.
Jafar! Jafar!
Have a grip!
Good adhesion.
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged kid, Aladdin.
- He has the lamp, Lago.
- Well, this wretch...
But you will
to relieve him.
Me?
Sultan?
They want me to be Sultan?
Huzzah!
#Hail to the conquering hero#
Aladdin, you just won
the heart of the princess.
What are you going to do next?
Psst. Your line is,
"I'm going to release the genie."
Anytime.
- Genius. I can't.
- Sure you can.
Go ahead,
“Genius, I wish you freedom.”
I'm serious.
Listen, I'm sorry. I am really.
But they want to make me a sultan.
No, they want to do
Prince Ali Sultan.
Without you,
I'm just Aladdin.
- Al, you win.
- Because of you.
The only reason we think
I'm worth everything, it's because of you.
And if they find out
I'm not really a prince?
What if Jasmine found out?
I would lose it.
Genius, I can't
keep it up for myself.
I can't wish you freedom.
GOOD. I understand.
You lied to everyone.
Hey, I was starting to feel left out.
Now, if you will excuse me, Master.
Genius, I'm so sorry.
GOOD.
So stay in there.
What are you guys looking at?
Look, I... I'm sorry.
Abu, I'm sorry. I do not have...
Wait. Come on.
What am I doing?
The genius is right.
I have to tell Jasmine the truth.
Ali. Oh, Ali.
Will you come here?
Well, there it is.
Jasmine?
Where are you?
In the menagerie. Hurry up.
I'm coming.
Do you have a problem, Pinky?
Jerk.
Boy, Jafar will be happy to see you.
- Excellent work, Lago.
- Oh, continue.
Not really. On a scale of
one to ten, you are an eleven.
Oh, Jafar, you are so kind.
I am embarrassed.
I'm blushing.
People of Agrabah,
my daughter finally
chose a suitor.
Jasmine.
Ali, where have you been?
Jasmine, there is something
I have to tell you.
The whole kingdom has turned around
for the announcement of the Father.
No, but, Jasmine, please listen to me.
- You do not understand...
- Good luck.
...Ali Ababwa!
Oh man.
Look at them,
applauding this little pipsqueak.
Let them clap.
Let them clap.
You know, Al, I'm really getting...
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, Al's role
will be played by a tall and dark
and sinister ugly man.
- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.
Genie, grant me my first wish.
I wish to reign on high as sultan.
- Wow!
- Bless my soul.
What is this?
What is going on?
Oh, my God, what's happening?
Father.
Jafar, you vile traitor.
For you, it's Sultan Vile Betrayer.
Oh yeah?
We'll just see about that.
The lamp.
Keepers of the finders, Abooboo.
Genius, no!
Sorry, kid.
I have a new master now.
Jafar, I order you to stop.
Ah, but there is a new order now.
My command.
Finally, you will bow to me.
We will never bow to you.
Why am I not surprised?
If you don't bow to a sultan,
then you will cower
in front of a wizard!
Genius, my second wish...
I wish to be the most powerful wizard
in the world!
Genius, stop!
Ladies and gentlemen,
a warm welcome to Agrabah
for the sorcerer Jafar!
Now where were we?
Oh yes. An abject humiliation.
Down there, boy.
Oh, princess.
There's someone I'm dying with
to present you.
Jafar. Don't touch her.
#PrinceAli
Yes it's him#
#But not as you know it#
#Read my lips
And face reality#
#Yes, meet an explosion from your past#
#Whose lies were too good to last#
#Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali#
Or should we say Aladdin?
Ali?
Jasmine, I tried to tell you.
I am fair...
#So Ali turns out to be
Simply Aladdin#
#Just a scam, shall I continue#
#Take it from me#
#His personality flaws#
#Give me a valid reason#
#To send him packing
On a one-way ticket#
#So its prospects
Take a terminal dive#
#His frozen assets, the chosen location
It's the end of the earth, whoopee!#
- So long!
- Goodbye see you soon.
#Ex-Prince Ali#
Abu.
Abu!
Oh, this is all my fault.
I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance. Abu.
- Do you agree?
- Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry, Abu.
I messed it up.
One way or another... I have to go back
and make things right.
Carpet.
Abu, start digging.
That's it.
Yeah! All right!
Now, back to Agrabah.
Let's go.
The puppet leader wants a cracker?
Here's your cracker.
Pushed to the back of the throat.
Here. Have plenty.
Stop that.
Jafar, leave him alone.
It hurts me to see you
reduced to that, Jasmine.
A beautiful flowering of the dice serves
like you
should be on the arm most
powerful man in the world.
What do you say, my darling?
Why, with you as queen...
Never.
I'm going to teach you some respect.
No, Genie.
I've decided
to make my last wish.
I wish Princess Jasmine
to fall desperately
in love with me.
Ah, Master, there are some additions,
compensation...
Don't answer me,
you big blue thug.
What will you do
I order you to do it, slave.
Jafar.
I never realized how much...
you are incredibly beautiful.
Mmmm. It's better.
Now, kitty...
tell me more about myself.
You are tall...
dark...
well dressed...
Al. Al, boyfriend.
Shh.
Al, I can't help you.
I work for Señor Psychopath now.
What are you going to do?
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'm going to improvise.
...nice little gaps
between your teeth.
Keep on going.
And your beard...
is so... twisted.
- You stole my heart.
-Jaf...!
- And the street rat?
What street rat?
Yeah !
It was...
You!
How many times
should I kill you, my boy?
Get the lamp.
No!
Ah, ah, ah, princess.
Your time is up.
Jasmine.
Oh, nice photo, Jaf...
Do not play with me.
Abu!
Things are falling apart
hurry now, my boy.
Get the point?
I'm just warming up.
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?
A snake, right?
Maybe you would like to see
how much I can look like a snake.
#Rick'em, rack'em, rock'em, rake
Stick that sword in that snake#
Stay out of it.
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... that's fine!
Aladdin.
Jasmine, wait.
You little idiot.
You thought you could win
the most powerful being on Earth.
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze it like a... Awk!
Without the genius, my boy,
you are nothing.
The genius. The genius.
Genius has more power
that you will never have.
What?
He gave you your power.
He can take it off.
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?
Admit it, Jafar.
You're still only in second place.
You're right.
His power exceeds mine.
But not for long.
The boy is crazy.
He's a little drunk on punch.
One shot too many with the snake.
Slave, I make my third wish.
I wish to be
an all-powerful genius!
Very well, your wish is my command.
Well done, Al.
Yes.
Yes!
The power.
Absolute power!
- What have you done?
- Trust me.
The universe belongs to me,
control!
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?
- Eh?
- You wanted to be a genius...
you got it.
What?
And everything that goes with it.
- No! No!
- I'm getting out of here.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
You are the genius. I do not want...
A very small living space.
Al, you little genius, you.
Ahh!
Take your damn mouth
out of my face.
- Oh, shut up, moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.
Allow me.
, years in a cave of wonders
that should calm him down.
Shut up!
Jasmine...
I'm sorry for lying to you
about being a prince.
I know why you did it.
Well, I guess...
Is this goodbye?
Oh, this stupid law.
It is not fair.
I love you.
Al, no problem.
You still have one wish left.
Just say the word
and you are a prince again.
But, Genius,
what about your freedom?
Hey, it's only
an eternity of servitude.
It's love.
Al, you won't find another girl
like her in a million years.
Believe me, I know.
I watched.
Jasmine, I love you,
but I have to stop pretending
to be something that I am not.
I understand.
Genius, I wish for your freedom.
A real
the prince's pedigree is forthcoming.
- What?
- Genius, you are free.
I'm free. I'm free.
Fast. Fast.
Wish for something extraordinary.
Say: “I want the Nile.” Try this.
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- Certainly not!
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!
I'm free! I'm finally free!
I'm hitting the road.
I'm going to see the world.
I am...
Genius, I am...
I'll miss you.
Me too, Al.
Never mind
what someone says,
you will always be a prince to me.
That's right.
You have certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.
It's this law
This is the problem.
- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?
From this day on,
the princess will get married
the one she deems worthy.
Him. I choose...
I choose you, Aladdin.
Call me Al.
Oh, all of you, come here.
A big group hug.
Group hug.
Do you mind if I kiss the monkey?
Ooh, furball.
Well I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.
I am leaving!
Goodbye, you two crazy lovebirds!
Hey, Rugman, ciao.
I am the story.
No, I am mythology.
I don't care what I am. I'm free!
#An entirely new world#
#A whole new life#
#For you and me#
#An entirely new world #?
Made you watch.

ALADDIN

Oh, I come from a country
From a distant place

Where the camels of the caravan roam

Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense

It's barbaric, but hey, it's my home

When the wind comes from the east
And the sun comes from the west

And the sand in the glass is right

Come down, stop
Jump on a mat and fly

Towards another Arab night

Arabian nights

Like the Arab days

Most of the time
Are hotter than hot



In many ways

Arabian nights

'Neath Arab moons

A fool out of his custody
Could fall and fall hard

Over there on the dunes

Ah, sa/aam and good evening
to you, worthy friend.

Please, please come closer.

Too close. A little too close.

There.

Welcome to Agrabah,

city ​​of mystery, of enchantment,

and the best merchandise
on this side of the Jordan,

on sale today. Get off.

Look at this. Yes.



Will not break. Will not...

It broke.

Ohh! Look at this.

I've never seen
one of them was previously intact.

This is the famous
Tupperware from the Dead Sea.

Listen. Ah, still good.

Wait. Do not go.

I can see you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.

I think then you would be
most rewarded for considering this.

Don't be fooled
by its banal appearance.

Like so many things,
it's not what's outside,

but what matters inside.

This is no ordinary lamp.

Once it changed the course
of the life of a young man.

A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than it seemed.

A diamond in the rough.

It begins with a dark night,

where a dark man waits

with a dark lens.

(HORSE NICKERS)

You are late.

A thousand apologies, oh patient.

Do you have it then?

I had to cut a few throats, but I managed.

Ah-ah-ahhh.

The treasure.

AH!

Trust me, my spicy friend.

- You will get what you expect.
- What's wrong. Awk!

Quickly! Follow the trail.

Faster.

(HORSE NEIGHBORS)

(WIND Howling)

JAFAR: Finally,
after all my years of research,

the Cave of Wonders.

Ok. Cave of Wonders.

By Allah.

Now remember. Bring me the lamp.

The rest of the treasure is yours,
but the lamp is mine.

(LAUGHTER)

Oh, the lamp. Oh, the lamp.

Damn, where did you dig up this bastard?

Shh.

(echoing rumble)

- Who disturbs my sleep?
-(THE THIEF gasps)

It's me, Gazeem, a humble thief.

Know this.

Only one can enter here,

the one whose value lies far away.

A diamond in the rough.

What are you waiting for? Keep on going.

(The beast sighs)

-(ROAR)
-(YELLING)

No!

(couemwe)

I can not believe it. I just don't believe it.

We will never get
a take on that stupid lamp.

Forget that. Look at this.
I'm so angry I'm molting.

Patience, Iago. Patience.

Gazeem was obviously
less than worthy.

Oh, there's a big surprise.

I think I'm having a heart attack
and die from this surprise.

What are we going to do?
We have a big problem here, a big...

Yes.

Only one can enter.

I have to find this one, this one...

Rough diamond.

MAN: Stop! Thief!

I'll have your hands for a trophy,
street rat.

All that for a loaf of bread?

Wow!

(YELLING)

- GUARD: There he is!
- You won't get out of this so easily!

Do you think it was easy?

(LAUGHING)

You two, over there,
and you, follow me.

- We'll find him.
- Hello ladies.

Getting into trouble a little early
today, isn't it, Aladdin?

- I got you.
- I have problems.

And this time...

( MONKEY SQUENQNG

Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

- Abu.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

(SINGING) I gotta keep a jump
Ahead of the bread queue

One step ahead of the sword

I only steal what I can't afford

That's all

A jump ahead of the lawmen

That's it, and it's not a joke

- The scum
- BOTH: Street rat

GUARD: Villain
MAN". Take that

Just a little snack, guys

tear it apart
Take it back, guys

I can take a hint
I have to face the facts

- You are my only friend, Abu
- WOMEN: Who?

Oh, it's sad that Aladdin hit rock bottom

He has become a single man who increases crime

I would blame the parents
Except he doesn't have them

I have to eat to live
I have to steal to eat

I tell you everything
When I had time

A jump ahead of slowpokes
One step ahead of my loss

Next time I'll use a pen name

Here it is

A jump ahead of the hitmen
One step ahead of the herd

I think I'm going to take a walk
Around the block

- MAN: Stop, thief
-Vanda/

- Abu
Scandal

Let's not be in too much of a hurry

I still think it's pretty tasty.

I have to eat to live
I have to steal to eat

Otherwise we would get along well

GUARDS: False

MAIN GUARD: Get him!

He has a sword!

You are idiots. We all have swords.

(MOANING)

- A jump forward of the hoof beats
- Vandal!

- A jump in front of the bump
- Street rat!

- Something before the disaster
Scoundrel!

They're fast, but I'm much faster

There you go, I better put my hand in

Wish me a safe landing
AH what I have to do is jump

(YELLING)

GUARDS: Yuck! Hey!

ABU: Yum, yum!

Uh-oh.

(SIGH)

Here. Keep on going. Take it.

(LAUGHING)

(MOANS)

Oh no. Eh?

On the way to the palace, I suppose.

Another suitor for the princess.

-(LAUGHING)
-(WOMAN SCREAMING)

-(HEIGNANT)
- Get out of my way, you brats.

Hey!

If I were as rich as you,
I could indulge in certain manners.

Oh. I'm going to teach you some manners.

(MEN LAUGH)

(GRIMACING)

Look at that, Abu.

It's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.

CROWD: Ooh!

You are a worthless street rat.

You were born a street rat,
you will die like a street rat,

and only your fleas will cry for you.

I'm not worth anything.

And I don't have fleas.

(SINGING) Riffraff, street rat

I don't buy this

If only they looked closer

Would they see a poor boy?

No, sire

They would discover

There is so much more

Tome

(Sighs) One day, Abu,
things will change.

We will be rich, live in a palace,

and I never had any problems at all.

(ROOSTERS GROWING)

I have never been so insulted.

Oh, Prince Ahmed.
You're not leaving that early, are you?

Good luck marrying her.

Oh! Jasmine.

Jasmine!

Jasmine!

- Jasmine!
-(GRAIN)

It's fucked up, Rajah.

So that's why
Prince Ahmed stormed out.

Oh, Father.

Rajah was just playing with him.
Isn't that right, Rajah?

you were just playing
with that too dressed,

The egocentric Prince Ahmed,
is not it ?

(ALL LAUGH)

(CLEARS THROAT)

Dearest, you need to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes calling.

The law says
you must be married to a prince

before your next birthday.

The law is false.

You only have three days left.

Father, I hate being forced to do this.

If I get married, I want it to be for love.

Jasmine,

it's not just this law.

I'm not going to be here forever,
well, I...

I just want to be sure
you are taken care of.

Foreseen.

Please try to understand.

I've never done anything on my own.
I never had real friends.

(GRUNTS)

Except you, Rajah.

I never even went outside
the walls of the palace.

But, Jasmine, you are a princess.

So maybe I don't want
be more of a princess.

Oooh! l...

Allah forbids you from doing so
have daughters.

Hmm?

I don't know where she got that from.

His mother wasn't that picky.

Oh! Ah, Jafar.

My most trusted advisor.

My life is only to serve you, my lord.

- I'm at the end of my nerves.
- Ah OK ! End of the rope!

(LAUGHING) keep going!

- Have a biscuit, pretty Polly.
-(JAFAR LAUGH)

Your Majesty certainly
makes sense with stupid animals.

(GRUNTS)

NOW,
maybe I can guess a solution

to this thorny problem.

If anyone can help, it's you.

But this would require the use
of the mystical blue diamond.

Oh- Uh, my ring?

But it's been in the family for years.

We need to find
the princess a suitor.

Don't worry.

Everything will be alright.

Everything will be alright.

The diamond.

Here, Jafar.

Everything you need will be fine.

You are very kind, my lord.

Now run and play
with your little toys, eh?

Yes. It will be pretty good.

(Spit, Cough)

I can not stand it anymore !

If I have to choke on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...

Barn! Beat!

Calm down, Iago.

Then I grabbed him by the head.
VVhack!

Soon I will be sultan,
not this confused idiot.

And then I stuff the crackers
in his throat. Ha, ha!

(MOANS)

Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

But I can't stay here
and let my life be lived for me.

I'll miss you.

(MOANS)

Bye.

(CALL FROM SELLERS)

Okay, Abu. Go.

Try that. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

(squeak)

- Take your paws off of that.
-(RAIL)

Why you...

Get out of here,
you damned, dirty monkey!

Bye.

- Well done, Abu.
-(COOING)

Breakfast is served.

Pretty lady, buy a pot.
There is no finer pot in brass or silver.

Sugar dates. Sweet dates and figs.

Sweet dates and pistachios.

Would the lady like a necklace?

A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

Fresh fish!

We catch them, you buy them!

Oh no. I do not think so.

-Om
-(SWALLOWING)

- Excuse me.
-(GULPS)

(belching)

I'm really, really sorry.

Wow.

Uh-oh.

Good morning? Good morning?

Oh, you must be hungry.

Here is.

You better be able to pay for that.

- Pay?
- No one steals my basket.

Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I have no money.

- Thief!
- Please...

If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the Sultan.

Do you know
what is the penalty in case of theft?

No! No, please!

Thank you sir.
I'm so glad you found it.

I looked for you everywhere.

- What are you doing?
- Play the game.

You know this girl ?

Unfortunately yes. She is my sister.

She's a little crazy.

She said she knew the Sultan.

She thinks the monkey is the sultan.

O wise Sultan, how can I serve you?

(GIBBERISH)

Tragic, isn't it?

But no harm is done.

Now come, sister.
It's time to go see the doctor.

Oh, hello, doctor. How are you doing?

No no no. Not this one.
Come on, Sultan.

(GIBERATION)

(PANTING)

Eh? What?

Come back here, you little thieves!

(BLAST)

couldn't we just wait for a real storm?

Hold your breath, Iago. Faster.

Yes, oh mighty evil one.

(PANTING)

Gone, sands of time.

Reveal me the one
who can enter the cave.

Yes! Yes!

Here it is.

My diamond in the rough.

It's him? It's the clown
We were waiting?

Let the guards extend it
an invitation to the palace, okay?

Swell.

(COUGH)

(SINISTER LAUGHTER)

Almost there.

I want to thank you
for arresting this man.

Uh, forget it.

So it's your first time
on the market, huh?

Is it so obvious?

Well, you kind of stand out.

I mean, uh, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

Hmm. I learn fast.

Wow.

(LAUGHING) Hey.

Come on. This way.

Wow. Watch your head there.

Be careful.

Is this where you live?

Yeah. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

This looks fabulous.

Well, it's not much,
but there is a superb view.

Wow. The palace looks
Quite surprising, huh?

Oh, it's wonderful.

I wonder what it would be like
it's as if I lived there,

and they have servants and servants.

Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

It's better than here.

You're always looking for food
and dodge the guards.

You are not free
to make your own choices.

- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...

- Trap.
- Trap.

(CLEARS THROAT)
So where are you from?

What does it matter?

I ran away and I won't come back.

- Really? How come?
- Why you...

My father is forcing me to get married.

It's... It's horrible.

- ALADDINI Abou!
-(CRY OF ANGRY)

What?

Abu says, uh, that's not fair.

What?

- Oh that's right ?
- Yes, of course.

And Abu
do you have anything else to say?

Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.

Oh man.

Hmm.

Tell him it's very nice.

There you are.

- They're after me!
- Are they after you?

My father must have sent them...

- Do you trust me?
- What?

- Do you trust me?
- Yes...

So jump!

We continue to cross paths,
Isn't that right, street rat?

Run! Go! Get out of here!

Take this thing away from me!

- This is the dungeon for you, boy.
- Let me go.

Let him go.

- Look here, men. A street mouse.
-(THE GUARDS LAUGH)

Let him go, on the princess's orders.

Princess Jasmine.

- Princess?
-ABU: Princess?

It's not your problem.
Do as I command. Free him.

I will, princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.

- You will have to discuss it with him.
- Believe me, I will.

Am I far?

Oh, princess.

Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

How can I be of help to you?

The guards just took a boy
of the market, on your orders.

Your father accused me
with the maintenance of peace in Agrabah.

- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

I can't breathe, Jafar.

Why, by kidnapping the princess,
Of course.

If you could just... Aah! It hurts!

He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

Oh dear.

Oh, how terribly upsetting.
If I had known...

What do you mean?

Unfortunately, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

Which sentence ?

- The death.
-(PANTING)

- By beheading.
- No.

I am extremely sorry, princess.

How can you?

(TEARS)

(couemwe)

(PANTING)

So how did it go?

I think she took it pretty well.

(JASMINE CRYING)

It's all my fault, Rajah.

- I didn't even know his name.
-(RAJAH WHISPER)

I must have seemed so stupid to him.

ABUI Y00-h00! Aladdin! Good morning!

Abu. Here.

(squeak)

Come on, help me out of this.

(REPRIMAND)

Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.

Yeah yeah yeah.

Don't worry, Abu.
I will never see her again.

I'm a street rat, remember?
And there is a law.

She must marry a prince.

- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!

I'm stupid.

MAN: You're just an idiot
if you give up, boy.

Who are you?

A humble prisoner, like you.

I listen.

There is a cave, my boy,
a cave of wonders,

full of treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

Ooh!

Treasure enough to impress
even your princess, I would bet.

Jaiar, can you hurry up?
I'm Gym, I'm here.

-(Calling)
- But the law says that only a prince can...

You've heard of the golden rule,
is not it ?

(wheezing laughter)

Why would you share all this
a wonderful treasure with me?

I need a young pair of legs
and a strong back to pursue it.

Um, one problem.

It is over there. We are here.

Uh-uh. Things are not always
what they seem.

So, do we have a deal?

Oh, I don't know.

(THUNDER CRASH)

Who disturbs my sleep?

Uh, it's me, Aladdin.

Proceed.

Do not touch anything except the lamp.

And then you will have your reward.

Come on, Abu.

(squeak)

- Can you look at that!
-(MOANS)

Abu!

(GROAN)

Don't touch anything.

We need to find this lamp.

(GRUNTS)

Eh?

- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you stop him?

(SCREAMING)

Abu, what are you, crazy?

A magic carpet.

Come on. To go out.
We're not going to hurt you.

(SCREAMING)

Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not going to bite.

THANKS.

(squeak)

Wait a minute. Do not go.

Maybe you can help us.

Hey! Wow!

- I think he knows where it is.
-(CRAWS WITH EXCITION)

(ECHOE5)

(whispers) Wait here.

(MOANING)

Oh!

That's it?

This is what we came for
all the way here to...

Abu! No!

- CAVE: Infidels!
- Oh oh.

CAVE: You have touched
the forbidden treasure!

Now you'll never do it again
see the day !

Wow!

Help! Help! Help!

I got you!

Carpet, let's move.

Abu!

Abu, now is not the time to panic.

Start panicking.

BOTH: Wow!

(ABU panting)

(THUNDER CRACKS)

(ROAR)

- Help me.
- Throw me the lamp.

I can't hold on. Give me your hand.

Give me the lamp first.

(MANIAC LAUGHTER)

Yes!

Finally!

-(MEAN LAUGH)
-(ALADDIN'S FIGHT)

What are you doing?

Give you your reward.

Your eternal reward.

(YELLING)

(SCREAMING)

(ROAR)

(CHUCKUNG)

It's mine.

It's all mine.

I... Where is he?

No.

No!

Jasmine?

SULTAN: Oh, my dear.

What's wrong?

(SNIFFING)

Jafar has

did something terrible.

There, there, my dear.

We will make things right.

Now tell me everything.

Oh.

Aladdin. Wake up.

Aladdin.

On! My head.

Were trapped.

This two-faced son of a jackal!

(Grunt)

Whoever he is,
he's been gone a long time with that lamp.

Ah!

(LAUGHING)
Well, you hairy little thief.

It looks like such a beating,
worthless piece of scrap metal.

Hey, I think there is
something written here,

but it's difficult to understand.

Aaaaahhhhh!

C)y!

10,000 years will give you
such a stiff neck.

Wait a second.

V\/hoa! Wow!

Does it feel good to be outside?

Hi. Where do you come from?
What is your name?

Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

Aladdin. Hello Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

Can we call you Al?
Or maybe just Dinner?

And Laddie? It looks like,
"Here, boy. Come on, boy."

I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

Do you smoke? Do you mind if I do?
(LAUGHING)

Oh, sorry, Cheeta.
I hope I didn't burn the fur.

Yo, Rugman. I did not see you
in a few millennia.

Give me some pompom. Yeah. Eh eh.

Say, you are much smaller
as my last master.

Either that or I get fat.

Look at me sideways.
Do I seem different to you?

Wait a minute. I am your master ?

That's right. He can be educated.
What would you wish for me?

The always impressive,

long content,

the often imitated,

but never duplicated...

(ECHOING) Duplicated, duplicated...

Genius of the lamp!

Right here, straight from the lamp,

here
for the fulfillment of your most sincere wishes.

THANKS.

- Wow. Wish fulfillment?
- Three wishes, to be exact.

And ixnay on the wish
for more wishes.

That's it. Three. Lino, back, very.

Now I know I'm dreaming.

Master, I don't think you really realize
what you have here.

So why not just ruminate
while I illuminate the possibilities.

(SINGING)
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves

Scheherazade had a thousand stories

But, master, you are lucky
Because you rolled up your sleeves

You have a brand of magic that never fails

You have power
In your corner now

You have punch, spice
Yahoo and how

See, all you have to do
I rub this lamp and I will say

"Mr. Aladdin, sir
What will be your pleasure? »

Let me take your order
Write it down

You never had a friend like me

Life is your restaurant
And I'm your butler

Come on, whisper what you want

You never had a friend like me

Yes sir
We pride ourselves on service

You are the boss, the king, the shah

Say what you want
It's yours, real dish

How about some more baklava?

Have a bit of column A
Try all of column B

I'm in the mood to help you, man

You never had a friend like me

Oh my

No no

Oh dear

(DIFFUSION)

Can your friends do this?

Can your friends do this?

Can your friends pull this

Did they take out their little hat?

Can your friends go poof

Hey, look here
Ha-ha!

Can your friends go?
“Abracadabra, let it rip”

So don't just sit there
Soft jaw, wandering eyes

I am here to answer
AH your midnight prayers

You certified me in good faith

You have a genius
For your business manager

I have a strong desire to help you

So what is your wish?
I really want to know

You have a list
It's three miles long, no doubt

AH what you have to do is rub like that

Mr. Aladdin, sir
I have a wish or two or three

I'm at work, big mogul

You never had a friend
I never had a friend

You never had a friend
I never had a friend

You never had a friend

Like me

Ah-ha-ha!

- Wah-ha-ha!
-(GREAT LAUGH)

You never had a friend like me

-(BUZZING)
-(WEAK APPLAUSE)

(CHABTERING) Huh?

-(MOANS)
- So, what's it going to be, master?

You will grant me
three wishes I want, right?

Oh, almost.

There are some reservations,
some compensations.

As?

So don't ask.

Rule number two.

I can't make anyone
fall in love with someone else.

You little pony there.

Rule number three. I can't bring
people come back from the dead.

It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing that.

Other than that, you have it.

- Hmm.
- Oh!

Reserves ? Do you mean the limits?

On wishes? An all-powerful genius.

I can't even bring people
back from the dead.

I don't know, Abu. It is probably
I can't even get us out of this cave.

Looks like we're going to have to
find a way out of here.

Excuse me?

Are you looking at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

And all of a sudden
are you letting me down?

I don't think so, not at the moment.

-(ABU SCREAMS)
- In case of emergency,

the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.

Were...

Get out of here!

SULTAN: Jafar, this is a scandal.

If it wasn't for all your years
good and loyal service...

From now on you need to discuss
condemnation of prisoners with rne,

before they were decapitated.

I assure you, Your Highness,
this won't happen again.

Jasmine...

Jafar. Let's put it all
complicated matters behind us.

Please.

At least some good will come
that I was forced to marry.

When I'm queen,
I will have the power to get rid of you.

(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

Right here right now. It's good.
So everything was settled.

Now, Jasmine, I'm coming back
about this suitor thing...Jasmine?

Jasmine!

(GRUNTING)

If only I had had this lamp.

(GROWL)
Saying we have to keep kissing

-for the rest of our lives...
- No, Iago.

Then she'll get us banned.

Or beheaded.

BOTH: Eww!

Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar.

What?

And then you become the sultan.

Oh.

Marry the shrew.

I become the sultan.

- The idea has merit.
- Yes, it deserves it. Yes.

And then we let stepfather down
and the little woman on the edge of a cliff.

Yeah !

Kersplat!

(MEAN LAUGH)

I like the way
your dirty little mind works.

(BOTH LAUGH SINISTERLY)

Don't stand to the mat
is completely stopped.

THANKS. Goodbye now.
Bye. THANKS.

Well how about this,
M. Do you doubt Mustafa?

Oh, you showed me that well.
Now, about my three wishes.

Are my ears deceiving me?

Three? You're one point behind, boy.

Oh no. I never really wished
to get out of the cave.

You did it alone.

Well, I feel sheepish.

Alright, you bad boy,
but no more gifts.

Fair exchange. So three wishes.

I want them to be good.

What would you like?

Me?

No one has ever asked me that before.

Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

- What?
- No I can not. I...

Come on. Tell me.

Freedom.

Are you a prisoner?

All this is an integral part
of the whole concert of genius.

Phenomenal cosmic powers...

A very small living space.

Genius, this is terrible.

But, oh, to be free...

No need to go there,
“Phew. What do you need?

“Phew. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

To be my own master.

Such a thing would be greater
that all the magic

and all the treasures from around the world.

But what am I talking about?

Let's be real here.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

Why not?

The only way for me to get out
that's if my master wants me to leave.

So you can guess how often
it happened.

I will do it. I will free you.

- Uh-huh, yeah, that's true.
- No, really, I promise.

After making my first two wishes,

I will use my third wish to free you.

Well, I hope so. All right.

Let's make magic.

So what is it?
What do you want most?

Well, there's this girl.

Fake.

I can't make anyone
falling in love, remember?

Oh, but, Genius,
she's smart and fun and...

- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

She has these eyes that...
And that hair. Wow.

And his smile... (SIGH)

Am I.

It's love.

But she's the princess.

Hey, can you make me a prince?

Let's see here.

Is chicken king? No.

Alaskan king crab.
Ouch. I hate it when they do that.

Cesar salad. Ah! And you, Brute? No.

Haha. “Make a prince.”

Is this an official wish?
Say the magic words.

Genius, I wish you
to make me a prince.

All right!

Eh eh ! Frame! Frame!

First up, this fez and vest combo
it's too much of the third century.

These fixes.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

No, let's work with me here.

Ooh. I like this. Very macho.

Now he needs something else.
What does that tell me?

It's about mode of transportation.

Excuse me, little monkey.
Aqul’. This way.

- Oh oh.
- GENIUS: Here he comes.

What better way to make your
entering the streets of Agrabah

than to ride
your own brand new camel?

Attention. They spit.

Mmmm. Not enough.

It's still not enough.
Let's see. What do you need?

Yes!

Esalalumbo Shimin Dumbo.

- Wow!
-(TRUMPETS)

Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action.

(TRUMPETS)

(Scared monkey noises)

Abu, you look good.

GENIUS: He has the outfit.
He has the elephant.

But we're not done yet.

Hold on to your turban, kid.
We're going to make you a star.

(THE DOOR OPENS)

Sir, I found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

Oh really?

Here.

"If the princess has not chosen
a husband at the appointed time,

“then the sultan will choose for her.”

But Jasmine hated all these suitors.

How could I choose someone
she hates?

Don't worry, my lord. There is more.

"If in the case
we cannot find a suitable prince..."

Jerk.

"A princess must then be married to..."

Hmm. Interesting.

What? WHO?

The royal vizier.

Well, that would be me.

I'm pretty sure...

Desperate times call
for desperate measures, my lord.

Yes. Desperate measures.

I will order the princess to...

But you are so old.

The princess will marry me.

The princess is getting married...

-(TRUMPET FRANK)
- What? What is this?

This music.

(CHUCKUNG)

Jafar, you have to come see this.

(SINGING) Make way for Prince Ali

Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali"

Hey, lead the way in the old bazaar

Hey you, let us pass
It's a new shining star

Oh come on, be the first in your neighborhood
To meet his gaze

Make way, here it is
Ring the bells, bang the drums

You will love this guy

Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa

Genuflect, show some respect
On your knees

Now do your best to stay calm

Improve your Sunday Salaam

So come and meet
His spectacular coterie

Prince Ali, he is powerful
Ali Ababwa

Strong as 10 ordinary men, definitely

He galloped against the hordes

A hundred bad guys with swords

Who sent these morons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

He has 75 golden camels

Aren't they lovely, June?

Purple peacocks, he has 53

Fabulous, Harry. I love feathers.

Does it have a zoo
I tell you

It's a world-class menagerie

Prince Ali, he is handsome
Ali Ababwa

This physique, how can I speak
Weak knee

Well come out to this place

Adjust your sail and get ready

Gawk and grove! and look
At Prince Ali's

- He has 95 white Persian monkeys
- He has monkeys

- Let's see the monkeys
- And to see them, it does not charge any fees

He is generous
So generous

He has slaves
He has servants and minions

They just suck at being loyal to everyone

Prince Ali

Prince Ali, he is in love
Ali Ababwa

I heard your princess
It was a pleasant sight to see

And that is why, good people,

He got dressed and went

With 60 elephants, llamas galore

With bears and lions
A marching band and more

With his 40 fakirs
Its cooks, its bakers

His birds chirping on the sidelines

Make way

For Prince Ali

Splendid. Absolutely wonderful.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Your Majesty,

I have traveled far and wide
look for your daughter's hand.

Prince Ali Ababwa.

Of course. Nice to meet you.

This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He too is delighted.

Ecstatic.

- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
-Ababwa.

Never mind.

You can't just scroll here
uninvited and expect...

By Allah,
This is a truly remarkable device.

Ooh.

I don't think I could...

Well, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.

Sire, I must advise you against this.

Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

AIE Aie Aie.

Ahh! Wow!

Attention I'm coming.

Oh, much further than
you have traveled, I am sure.

- Try me.
- SULTAN: Be careful, Polly.

Hey, check this out.

Look at him with that stupid rug.

Ah!

Phew!

Out of the way. I'm coming to land.

Jafar, look at this.

- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- It was lovely.

Yes, I seem to have a gift for that.

This is a very impressive youth.

And a prince at that.

- I don't trust him, Sire.
- It's absurd.

There is one thing I am proud of, Jafar,
I am an excellent judge of character.

Oh, excellent judge. Yes of course. Not!

SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one.

And I'm pretty sure
I would like Princess Jasmine.

Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on behalf of Jasmine.

What makes him think
Is he worthy of the princess?

Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

How dare you.

You all.
Stay to decide my future?

I am not a prize to be won.

Oh dear.

Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time to calm down.

I think it's time to say goodbye
to Prince Abubu.

ALADDIN: (SIGHS)
What will I do?

I should have known I couldn't get out of this
this stupid prince wishes.

(GROWL)

So get moving.

Hey-

It's a good decision.

I can not believe it. I lose to an all-in.

Genius, I need help.

Alright, Sparky, here's the deal.

If you want to woo the little lady,
you have to be an honest shooter.

- Did you get it?
- What?

(WHILE READING)

Certainly not.

If Jasmine found out I was really
a dirty street rat,

she would make fun of me.

A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

Al, joking aside,
you really should be yourself.

Hey, that's the last thing I want to be.

Okay, I'll go see her.

I just...
I have to be gentle, cool, confident.

What do I look like?

Like a prince.

(SIGH)

- ALADDIN: Princess Jasmine?
-(GROWL)

- Who is here?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

Hmm. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

I do not want to see you.

No, no, please, princess.
Give me a chance.

- JASMINE: Leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

So, how is our little friend?

- Good kitty, take off.
-(RAJAH GROWING)

Down, kitty.

Wait. Wait.

I know you?

Uh no. No.

You remind me of someone
I met in the market.

The marketplace?

I have servants who go
to the market for me.

Well, I even have servants who go to
the market for my servants,

so it couldn't have been me you met.

No, I guess not.

She's smart, funny, the hair, the eyes.

Nothing. Choose a feature.

Hmm. Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You are very...

Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,

-punctual.
- Punctual.

- Punctual?
- Sorry.

- Um, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

Hmm.

I'm rich too, you know.

- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.

I know.

A great prize for any prince to marry.

Um, that's true. RIGHT. A prince like me.

Warning! Warning!

RIGHT. A prince like you.

And all the other plush shirts,
swaggering peacock I met.

Help! Help!

- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!

- Do you want me to sting her?
- Get out.

OK very good.
But remember, “bee” yourself.

- Yes indeed.
- What?

Um... Um, you're right.

(Sighs) You're not fair
a prize to be won.

You should be free
to make your own choice.

I will leave now.

- No!
- What? What?

How...

How do you do this?

- It's a flying carpet.
- It's adorable.

-(KISSES)
- You, uh...

We could leave the palace,
see the world.

- Is it safe?
- Of course. Do you trust me?

- What?
- Do you trust me?

Yes.

(SINGING) I can show you the world

Brilliant, shimmering, splendid

Tell me, princess

Now when was the last time you did
Let your heart decide

I can open my eyes

Take wonder by wonder

Over, side and under

On a flying carpet

An entirely new world

A fantastic new point of view

No one to tell us no
Or where to go

Or let's say we're just dreaming

An entirely new world

A dazzling place
I never knew

But when I'm up there
It's crystal clear

That now I'm in
A whole new world with you

ALADDIN: Now I'm here
A whole new world with you

JASMINE: incredible shows

Indescribable feeling

Hovering, tumbling, freewheeling

Through an endless diamond sky

- An entirely new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes

- One hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it gets better

I'm like a shooting star
I've come this far

I can't go back to where I was

- An entirely new world
- Every turn is a surprise

- With new horizons to pursue
- Every moment red letter

BOTH: I'll chase them anywhere
There is time to waste

Let me share
This whole new world with you

- An entirely new world
- An entirely new world

- This is where we will be
- This is where we will be

- A thrilling chase
- A wonderful place

For you and me

- Everything is so magical.
- Yeah.

It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

No. He hates fireworks.

He doesn't like to fly either.

Um, it's, uh... Oh, no.

You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.

- Why did you lie to me?
-Jasmine, I'm sorry.

- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.

- That I wouldn't understand?
- No.

I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

Who are you? Tell me the truth.

The truth?

The truth. Uh...

The truth is...

But I really am a prince.

Why didn't you tell me?

Well you know,

royalty goes out on the town
disguised,

it seems a little strange,
you do not think ?

Hmm.

Not so strange.

Good night, my handsome prince.

Sleep well, princess.

(SIGH)

Yes!

(SIGH)

For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go well.

-(SCREAMING)
-(IN TROUBLE)

(Muffled) Abu. Abu.

Hold it.

I'm afraid you're exhausted
welcome, Prince Abubu.

(Muffled) Why, you...

Make sure it's never found.

(LAUGHING)

Never fail. You enter the bath
and there is a problem with the lamp.

Good morning? AI?

(gasping) AI! Kid, stop.

You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help you unless you make a wish.

You must say: "Genius,
I want you to save my life." Understood?

Come on, Aladdin!

I take that as a yes.
(IMITATE ALARM)

Superior reach.

(BABBLING IN GERMAN)

(couemwe)

Don't scare me like that.

Genius, I, uh...

L.-

-Thank you, Genie.
- Oh, Al.

I'm starting to like you, kid.

It's not that I want to choose
curtains or anything.

(BURNING)

SULTAN: Jasmine.

Oh, Father, I just had
the most wonderful moment.

- I am so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

I chose a husband for you.

- What?
- You will marry Jafar.

(PANTING)

You are speechless, I see.
A great quality in a wife.

I will never marry you.

- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali is gone.

Better check
your crystal ball again, Jafar.

- Prince Ali!
-(PANTING)

HOW in the... Um. AWk!

Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.

He's obviously lying.

Obviously lying.

Father, what is wrong with you?

I know what's wrong.

Oh my!

Your Highness,
Jafar controls you with this.

(BLAMING) What? Jafar?

You, traitor!

Guards! Guards!

Well that's it. Were dead. Forget that.

Just dig a grave for both of us.
Were dead.

- SULTAN: Arrest Jafar immediately.
-(IN TROUBLE)

It's not done yet, boy.

-(LAUGHING)
-(TO COUGH)

-Jasmine, are you okay?
- Yes.

Jafar, my most trusted advisor,

plotting against me all this time.

It's horrible, just horrible.

How will I ever...

Eh?

Could this be true?

My daughter finally
chosen a suitor?

Ha, ha! Praise Allah!

You brilliant boy, I could kiss you.

I will not do it. I leave that to my...

But you will be married at the same time.

Yes yes. And you will be happy
and prosperous,

and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

-Sultan?
-SULTAN: Yes.

A beautiful, honest young man
like you,

a person of your impeccable
moral character

This is exactly what this kingdom needs.

IAGO: We have to get out of here.
I need to start packing. Only the essentials.

We have to travel light.

I think I'm making a weird face with that.

(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

Jafar! Jafar! Have a grip!

Good adhesion-

Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged kid, Aladdin.

- He has the lamp, Iago.
- Well, this wretch...

But you're going to get rid of it.

Me?

Sultan?

They want me to be Sultan?

Huzzah!

(SINGING) Hail the conquering hero

(PATRIOTIC AIR PLAY)

Aladdin, you just won
the heart of the princess.

What are you going to do next?

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

(whispering) Psst. Your line is,
"I'm going to release the genie."

Anytime.

- Genius. I can't.
- Sure you can.

You simply say: “Genius, I wish you freedom. »

I'm serious.

Listen, I'm sorry. I am really.
But they want to make me a sultan.

Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

- Al, you win.
- Because of you.

The only reason we think
I'm worth everything, it's because of you.

And if they find out
I'm not really a prince?

I can't wish you freedom.

GOOD. I understand.
After all, you lied to everyone.

Hey, I was starting to feel left out.

Now, if you'll excuse me, master.

(smaruwe)

Genius, I'm so sorry.

(RASPBERRY)

GOOD. So stay in there.

What are you guys looking at?

-(MOANS)
-(SNIFFING)

ALADDIN: Listen, I... I'm sorry.

Abu, I'm sorry. I do not have...

Wait. Come on.

(smaruwe)

What am I doing?

(Sighs) The genius is right.

I have to tell Jasmine the truth.

JASMINE: Ali. Oh, Ali.
Will you come here?

(SIGH) Well, there you go.

Jasmine? Where are you?

(IMITES JASMINE)
In the menagerie. Hurry up.

- I'm coming.
-(PANTING)

(MEAN LAUGH)

-(awkward laughter)
- Do you have a problem, Pinky?

Jerk.

(happy chuckle)

(IMITATES JAFAR)
“Excellent work, Iago.”

Oh, keep going.

"No, really. On a scale
from one to 10, you are an 11.”

Oh, Jafar, you are so kind.

I am embarrassed. I'm blushing.

People of Agrabah,

my daughter finally
chose a suitor.

-(CROWD CHEERING)
- ALADDIN: Jasmine.

Ali, where have you been?

Jasmine, there is something
I have to tell you.

The whole kingdom has turned around
for the announcement of the Father.

- You do not understand...
- Good luck.

-SULTAN: Ali Ababwa!
-(APPLAUSE)

Oh man.

(APPLAUSE)

Look at them,
applauding this little pipsqueak.

Let them clap.

You know, Al, I'm really getting...

I don't think you're him.
Tonight, Al's role

will be played by a tall and dark
and sinister ugly man.

- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.

Genie, grant me my first wish.

I wish to reign on high as sultan.

- Wow!
- Bless my soul.

What is this? What is going on?

Oh, my God, what's happening?

Father.

(CALLING)

Jafar, you vile traitor.

For you, it's Sultan Vile Betrayer.

Oh yeah? We'll just see about that.

-(GASPS) The lamp.
-(JAFAR LAUGH)

Keepers of the finders, Abubu.

(WHISTLES)

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

Genius, no!

Sorry, kid. I have a new master now.

Jafar, I order you to stop.

Ah, but there is a new order now.

My command.

Finally, you will bow to me.

We will never bow to you.

Why am I not surprised?

If you don't bow to a sultan,

then you will cower before a sorcerer!

Genius, my second wish...

-(JAFAR LAUGHS MANIACALLY)
- Genie, stop!

Ladies and gentlemen,

a warm welcome to Agrabah
for the sorcerer Jafar!

Now where were we?

Oh yes. An abject humiliation.

- Down, my boy.
-(MEOWS)

Oh, princess.

There is someone
I'm dying to introduce it to you.

Jafar. Don't touch her.

(SINGING) Prince Ali
Yes it's him

But not as you know it

Read my lips
And face reality

Yes, meet a blast from your past

Whose lies were too good to last

Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali

Or should we say Aladdin?

Ali?

Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I am fair...

So Ali turns out to be
Simply Aladdin

Just a scam, should I continue

Take it from me

His personality flaws

Give me an adequate reason

To send him packing
On a one-way trip

Genius!

So his prospects
Take a terminal dive

His assets frozen, the location chosen
It's the end of the Earth, whoopee!

- So long!
- Goodbye see you soon.

Ex-Prince Ali

(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

(WIND Howling)

(SHIVERS)

Abu.

Abu!

(ABU MOANING)

Oh, this is all my fault.

I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance.

I'm sorry, Abu.

I messed it up.

Somehow I have to go back
and make things right.

Carpet.

-(ABU CHITTERS)
-(ALADDIN STRAIN)

Abu, start digging.

(frantic panting)

That's it.

Yeah! All right!

(GROAN)

Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.

- IAGO: The puppet leader wants a cracker?
-(SULTAN’S MOAN)

Here's your cracker. Push them
all the way down your throat.

Here. Have plenty.

Stop that. Jafar, leave him alone.

(GROWL)

It hurts me to see you
reduced to that, Jasmine.

A beautiful desert bloom
like you

should be on the arm most
powerful man in the world.

What do you say, my darling?

Why, with you as queen...

- Never.
-(ENGAGED GROWL)

I'm going to teach you some respect.

(PANTING)

No, Genie.

I decided to make my last wish.

I wish Princess Jasmine

fall hopelessly in love with me.

JASMINE: Jafar.

I never realized how much
you are incredibly beautiful.

Mmmm. It's better.

Now, kitty,

tell me more about myself.

You are tall, dark,

well dressed...

AI. AI, boyfriend.

Shh.

Al, I can't help you.

I now work for Sefior Psychopath.
What are you going to do?

Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'm going to improvise.

JASMINE: Pretty little gaps
between your teeth.

Keep on going.

And your beard is so crooked.

- You stole my heart.
-(panting) Jafar...

-(IAGO MUMPS)
- And the street rat?

What street rat?

-(CLAP)
-(PANTING)

(PANTING)

BOTH: Yeah!

It was...

You!

How many times
should I kill you, my boy?

Get the lamp.

No!

Ah, ah, ah, princess. Your time is up.

(GROWL)

Jasmine.

Oh, nice photo, Jaf...

Do not play with me.

Abu!

JAFAR: Things are falling apart
hurry now, my boy.

(JAFAR LAUGHING)

Get the point?

(LAUGHING)

(STRETCH)

I'm just warming up.

Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

A snake, right?

Maybe you would like to see
how much I can look like a snake.

(YELLING)

(SINGING)
Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake 'em

Stick this sword in this snake

Stay out of it.

Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it...Great!

JASMINE: Aladdin.

(SCREAMING)

Jasmine, wait.

(LAUGHING) You little idiot.

You thought you could win
the most powerful being on Earth.

Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze it like a... Awk!

The genius. The genius.

Genius has more power
that you will never have.

What?

He gave you your power.
He can take it off.

Al, what are you doing?
Why are you involving me in this?

Admit it, Jafar.
You're still only in second place.

You're right.

His power exceeds mine.

But not for long.

The boy is crazy.
He's a little drunk on punch.

One shot too many with the snake.

Slave, I make my third wish.

I wish I was an almighty genius!

Very well, your wish is my command.
Well done, Al.

Yes.

Yes!

The power.

-(JAFAR LAUGH)
-(JASMIN COUGH)

Absolute power!

- What have you done?
- Trust me.

The universe belongs to me,
control!

Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

- Eh?
- You wanted to be a genius, you got it.

What?

And everything that goes with it.

- No no!
- I'm getting out of here.

ALADDIN :
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

You are the genius. I do not want...

A very small living space.

Al, you little genius, you.

- Ahh!
'(MEOW)

JAFAR: Take your damn mouth
out of my face.

- IAGO: Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

Allow me.

(IAGO SCREAMING INDISTINCTLY)

JAFARI Shut up!

Jasmine...

I'm sorry for lying to you
about being a prince.

I know why you did it.

Well, I guess this is goodbye?

Oh, this stupid law. It is not fair.

I love you.

(SNIFFS) Al, no problem.
You still have one wish left.

Just say the word
and you are a prince again.

Hey, it's just an eternity of servitude.

It's love.

Al, you won't find another girl
like her in a million years.

Believe me, I know. I watched.

Jasmine, I love you,

but I have to stop pretending
to be something that I am not.

I understand.

Genius, I wish for your freedom.

A real
the prince's pedigree is forthcoming.

- What?
- Genius, you are free.

I'm free. I'm free.

Fast. Fast.
Wish for something extraordinary.

Say: “I want the Nile.”
Nile Wish. Try this.

- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- Certainly not!

(LAUGHING JOLIE)

Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

I'm free! I'm finally free!

I'm hitting the road.
I'm going to see the world. I am...

Genius, I am...

I'll miss you.

Me too, Al. (SNIFFS)

No matter what anyone says,

you will always be a prince to me.

That's right.

You have certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.

It is this law that poses a problem.

- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

From this day on,

the princess will get married
the one she deems worthy.

Him. I choose...

I choose you, Aladdin.

Call me Al.

Oh, all of you, come here.
A big group hug.

Group hug.

Do you mind if I kiss the monkey?

Ooh, furball.

Well I can't do any more damage
around this Popsicle stand.

I am leaving!

Goodbye, you two crazy lovebirds!

Hey, Rugman, ciao. I am the story.

No, I am mythology.

I don't care what I am. I'm free!

(SINGING) A whole new world

A whole new life

For you and me

An entirely new world
