WAR OF STATES: EPISODE III - THE SITH'S REVENGE
Near the end of the Clone Wars, Darth Sidious has shown up and is ready to accomplish the final part of his plan to rule the galaxy.
Sidious is ready for his new apprentice Darth Vader to get in on the action and kill the remaining Jedi.
However Vader is struggling to choose the dark side and save his wife or remain loyal to the Jedi order .

Lock him up, R2.
Master, General Grievous's ship is straight ahead-
who flies vulture droids.
I’ve seen it. This will not be difficult.
- Oddball, are you a copycat? - Copy, Red President.
Mark my position. Form your squad behind me.
We are in your heart, General Kenobi.
S-foils set up in attack .
This is where the fun begins.
Let them pass through us.
They’re all over me. I gave them my- .
- I'm going to help them. - No.
No, they do their job so we can do ours.
Missiles are slow. It's a slow motion.
- They're overwhelming us. - They're around.
All right, R4.
No, no, no, no-No, nothing too good.
Surges all power units, R2. Stop the reverse thrusters .
We've got 'em, R2.
Running for the droids .
- I'm stirred. Anakin? - I've seen them. Buzz the droids.
R4, very careful. You are a- .
We have
They shut down all the controls .
- Move to the left so I can get clear of them. - The mission.
To the commando ship. Welcome to the Chancellor. I’m running out oftricks here.
The name of the-
- Hold your fire! You're not helping here. - I agree with you. Bad idea.
I couldn’t see a thing. My cockpit is foggy.
They’re all over me. Anakin!
- Go to the left. - Hold on, Anakin. You will kill them both.
Get out of here. There's nothing more to do.
I will not leave without you, Master.
Get him, R2.
Get to know each other.
R2, hit the buzz droid's middle eye.
- Yes, you got him! - Large, R2
The general's command ship was dead ahead.
So do you think shields are overrated?
Sorry, Teacher.
I have a bad feeling about it.
That’s where they belong. Please accept them.
R2, to the chancellor.
The chancellor's signal came right-
the viewing platform at the top of the tower.
I understand Count Dooku.
I sense a trap. The next move?
Spring uka sipita.
R2 , return . I need you to stay with the ship.
Here. Download this and wait for orders .
What's up, Captain?
Two Jedi land in the hangar's main bay. We’re tracking them down.
Like Count Dooku said.
T'unjirinaka.
Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em.
Roger was like that. Roger, roger, .
Roger, roger, .
Those are Jedi warriors all right.
Did you hit the stop button? No. Do you do that?
- No. - Well, there's more than one way from here.
We don’t want to go out.
We want to move. R2, activate elevator 31174 .
Come on, R2 What is the value of the ?
R2, are you a copycat?
R2, activate the elevator.
31174 of the Act.
Get back to work. There is nothing wrong with that.
Elevator 31174 .
R2, we have- .
Always on the move.
R2 , the comlink .
R2, can you hear me?
R2?
¡Waw!
R2! R2!
Stop. Stop. R2, we have to grow.
Hands down, Jedi.
R2, are you a copycat?
R2, can you hear me? R2, we are going up, not down.
¡Hey, Friday!
Now, that's even better.
You silly little astro droid.
That’s you.
Nayranakaja! Nayranakaja!
What was it about? Well, R2 is- .
No loose wire jokes. What's the sista?
He's trying to. I didn't say anything.
The Chancellor. Are you okay with it?
Number Dooku.
This time we'll do it together. I was about to say that.
You need to get help. You don’t have to compare yourself to him. He is a Sith lord.
Chancellor Palpatine, Sith lords are our specialty.
Your swords, please.
We don't want to mess things up in front of the chancellor.
Don't run away this time, Dooku.
I'm still looking forward to this.
Our powers have doubled since we last met, Count.
Ok. Twice the pride, twice the fall.
Get-
I find you terrible, Skywalker.
You have hatred. You have anger.
But you don’t use it.
Good, Anakin. Ok.
Kill him off.
Kill him now.
I don't have to do that.
Please do the same.
Well done, Anakin.
He was too bad to live.
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
I shouldn't have done that. Not the Jedi way.
It is only natural. He cut your hand, and you want revenge.
Not the first time, Anakin.
Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People?
Now we have to leave before more security droids arrive.
Anakin, there is no time.
We need to get off this ship before it's too late.
- He seems to be fine. - Leave him alone, or we'll never get there.
His fate will be the same as ours.
Prepare to attack!
Taqi pilanaka, nina! Nina!
The elevator doesn’t work.
R2, activate elevator 3224 .
- Reverse stabilizers. - Return stabilizers.
luran magnetization! luran magnetization!
Fire emergency booster engines.
We’ve leveled up, sir.
Easy. We're kind of in trouble.
What did I miss? Wait.
- What's the answer? - Such.
R2 R2, turn off the elevator.
It’s too late. Fly!
Check out the hangar bay where things still feel running.
R2, go here.
R2, are you a copycat?
General, we found the Jedi.
They are in corridor 328. Activate lightning shields.
Ray shields.
Please wait a little longer. How did this happen?
We are smarter than this. Apparently, it is not.
I said patiently. Patience?
If. The R2 will be part of it in a few hours,
and then... he'll release the ray shields.
Consider? No problem.
You don’t have to walk around.
Do you have a plan "B"?
If. The interlocutor.
General Kenobi . We're waiting for you.
P'ampacht'ita.
That wasn't much of a rescue. You are welcome.
And-
Anakin Skywalker .
I was hoping someone you're dating would be a little... older.
General Grievous . You are smaller than I expected.
Jedi is a mess .
We have a job, Anakin. Try not to offend him.
Lightsabers will make a nice addition to my collection.
Not this time around. And this time, you won’t survive.
R2.
Destroy them!
Torture them!
Come. Now!
Stay in the seasons! Wow!
Welcome to him! Welcome to him!
Run!
Don’t worry about them. The ship is in orbit. Yes, sir.
You lost, General Kenobi.
Get out of here! Run!
Time to abandon ship.
All exhaust pods are launchable.
It’s a sad thing. Would you drive a cruiser like that?
You mean, do you know how to land what’s left of this thing? Ok?
Well, under any circumstances, I mean you don't need to be able to pilot this thing.
Leash yourself.
Open all hatches . Increase all flaps and fin drag.
We lost something.
Don’t worry about it. We're still running half the ship.
We're picking it up really fast right now.
Eighth and 60th.
We have the atmosphere. You have to hold on to it. Let us level up.
To install Jayapachataki.
Easy, R2
5000. Fire ships left and right.
- We'll take you - The copy.
- Landing strip, straight forward. - We're coming in too hot.
Another happy landing.
- Are you coming Master? - No, I'm not politically active.
I have to tell the council.
Plus, someone has to be the poster boy.
Wait. This whole operation was your idea.
Let’s not forget, Anakin, you saved us from the buzz droids.
And you killed Count Dooku, and saved the chancellor,
unconsciously carrying me on my back.
All because of your education.
Anakin, let’s be honest. If you are the hero today,
and you deserve your big day with politicians.
Alright. But you owe me one, and not for saving your body 10 times over.
About eight times. The business of Cato Neimoidia is not-counted.
I’ll see you at the briefing.
Chancellor Palpatine, are you alright?
If. Thank you for your two Jedi knights.
Count Dooku is killed, but General Grievous once again escapes.
General Grievous will run and hide, as he does. He’s a horrible guy.
But after Count Dooku dies, he becomes the leader of the droids.
And I tell you, the senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous lives.
The Jedi Council will then make finding Grievous our top priority.
Look at the guys. Excuse me.
Come on, R2 The Republic can't honor you enough.
Thank you, Senator Organa.
So it can't be all that bad.
I agree with you there now.
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.
But the battle will continue until General Grievous has his spare parts.
Well, I’ll do everything in the senate.
Excuse me. Exactly.
Anakin was the name.
I love you, Padmé.
There were questions that you were killed.
I'm going to be fine.
It feels like a lifetime apart.
And it might have been, had the chancellor not been kidnapped.
I don't think they'll ever get us back from the outer tire rounds.
Wait. It’s not here. Yes, here it is.
I-I am tired of all this deception. I don’t care if they know we’re married.
Anakin, don't say that.
Are you okay with it? You’re shaking.
What’s going on?
A strange thing happened.
Ani, I’m pregnant.
It is- .
So, it's won-It's awesome.
What are we going to do?
Now we won’t have to worry about anything. Alright?
This is an exciting time.
The happiest time of my life.
♪♪ and many more
Yes, Lord Sidious?
General Grievous, .
I advise the separatist leaders to send Mustafar .
It will be done, sir.
The end of the war is near, General.
But Count Dooku-
His death was an important loss.
Soon the new apprentice-
the other is younger and stronger.
Ani, I want to bring my son back home from Naboo.
We can go to the sea where no one will know,
where we can live in safety.
I can go early in the morning and fix her baby’s room.
I know that unmistakable fact. It's near the gardens.
You are so beautiful.
This is because I am so loved.
No.
No, I love you so much.
So love blinds you?
So I'm not really saying that.
But that was probably true.
Anakin, help us!
What is it that bothers you?
No.
I remember when I gave you this.
How long does it take to be honest with each other?
It was a dream come true.
Bad?
Like I used to say about my mother,
just before he died.
And?
And it was about you.
Sita.
It was just a dream come true.
You die in childbirth.
And the baby?
I don't know.
It was just a dream come true.
I won’t let this one be true.
This baby will change our lives.
I doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate.
And if the council finds out you are the father, you will be banished-
I- I know it. I know.
Do you think Obi-Wan can help us?
We don't need his help.
Our baby is a blessing.
Preconceptions? Preconceived notions .
The visions of your- .
They have pain and suffering.
Soul.
Are you talking about yourself, or someone you know?
In us.
Is it near you?
If.
Be careful with the future in mind, Anakin.
Fear of extinction is a path to darkness.
I will not allow these visions to come true, Master Yoda.
Death is a natural part of life.
Rejoice for those around you who become the Force.
Worry about them, don't worry. Miss them, don’t you.
Attachment leads to jealousy.
It's the shadow of love.
What should I do, Master Yoda?
Teach yourself to let go…
of everything you feared to lose.
You missed the news about the outer tire grind.
I'm sorry. I was held tight.
I have no excuse. In short, they're doing well.
Saleucami fled, and Professor Vos sent his troops to Boz Pity.
So what is the problem?
The Senate is waiting…
today more executive powers to vote for chancellor.
So that's just foolishness and overdoing it. Is that a bad thing?
It'll make it easier for us to finish this war.
Beware of your friend Palpatine.
Why should you be so careful?
He has asked for your presence. For what purpose?
He didn't say anything. He didn’t tell the council?
That is strange, isn't it? All of these are unknown.
And it made me feel uncomfortable.
Trust me, Anakin.
Of course.
I need your help, baby.
What do you mean?
I’m dependent on you. For what purpose? I don’t understand.
To be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic.
Anakin , 1999 .
I appoint you as the personal representative of the Jedi Council .
Me? A breeder?
I'm still struggling, sir.
But the council makes their own choices. They will never get it.
I think they will. They need you.
It is more than you.
This appointment quietly the council refused.
Unfortunately this decision was made by Chancellor Palpatine.
I understand.
You are in this consciousness, but we do not grant you the degree of master.
Is there?
How do you do this? It's a very sad thing.
That is not a fact.
How can you be on the council and not master it?
Take a seat, young Skywalker.
Forgive me, Master.
We have studied all systems in the Republic,
but they find no sign of General Grievous.
Hiding on the outside rim Grievous is.
Clean the exterior systems .
We don’t have many ships left.
What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
It's important to dispatch an attack group as soon as possible .
He was right about it. It’s a system that shouldn’t be lost.
Go on, I'll tell you.
I have good relations with Wookiees.
This is then fixed. Yoda's got a battalion of clones...
Kashyyyk's challenge to the Wookiees.
May the power be with you all.
What kind of nonsense is this?
Put me on the council and not make me a patron?
Never done in Jedi history. It's a humiliation.
Relax, Anakin. You have been given a great honor.
Being on the council at your age wasn’t what it used to be.
The reality is you're too close to the chancellor.
The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
I swear I did not ask to be put on the council. But it is what you want.
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to be a good one.
That has nothing to do with it.
The only reason the council approved the appointment…
it’s because the chancellor has confidence in you.
And? Anakin, I agree with you.
I didn't mean to put you through that. What is the situation?
The council wants to keep you informed of all the chancellor’s actions.
They want to know what he’s doing.
Do they want to target the chancellor?
But that’s treachery. We're at war, Anakin.
Why didn’t the council give us that assignment when we were in session?
This assignment does not need to be on the record.
The Chancellor is not a bad guy, Obi-Wan.
He became friends with me. He’s taken care of me since I got here.
Therefore, you need to help.
Anakin, our loyalty is to the senate, not the president,
who manages to stay in office long after his job is over.
Members of the Senate asked for a longer stay.
Yes, but control your emotions, Anakin. Something is out of place.
You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code,
Against the Republic, against a mentor and a friend.
That’s the uncertainty here. Why are you asking me this?
The council asked you.
Anakin didn't go too happy with his new assignment.
It’s terrifying, putting them together.
I don’t think the guy can handle it.
I don’t trust him.
With all due respect, Master, isn’t he the chosen one?
Can't he destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
That’s what the prophecy says.
It could be a misread prophecy.
He will not let me down.
He has never done that.
I hope I'm right.
Sometimes I wonder what's going on in the Jedi order .
I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
Have you ever thought we could have a bad conversation?
What do you mean?
What if the democracy we think we serve doesn’t exist,
and the Republic has become so corrupt that we fought to destroy it?
I don't believe that.
And you sound like a separatist .
This noise is like a disobedience.
Now you're closer to the chancellor than anyone.
Please, ask him to stop fighting and resume diplomacy.
Don’t ask me to do that.
Make a motion in the Senate, where such a request is made.
- What's the answer? - No.
You don’t have to do that. Don't close it. I will help you out.
Catch me, guys.
Like we did on the beach at Naboo.
So long ago, when there was nothing but love.
No politics, no conlos, no wars.

We'll capture the monster and end this battle.
I was worried about the collective knowledge of the council…

You are the best choice, by far.
Sit down and smile.

Anakin , 1999 .
you know, you can't trust the Jedi Council.
If they don't know you in their plot, they will soon.
I don't understand.
You must understand what I expected.
The Jedi Council wants control of the Republic.
They decided to betray me.
I don't think so- Anakin.
Look for your feelings.
You know, right?
I know they don't trust you. Or members of the senate.
Or the Republic, or democracy, for that matter.
I have to admit, my confidence in them has been shaken.
Sister in law?
They ask you to do something…
that made you feel dishonest, didn't it?
They asked you to look at me, right?
I don't -
I don’t know what to say.
Remember your previous lessons.
Everyone who has gained power is afraid of losing it.
Even the Jedi. The Jedi use their power for good .
Well it's a point of view, Anakin.
Sith and Jedi are similar in almost every way,
along with their quest for greater power.
The Sith rely on willpower for power.
They think inside-themselves.
And the Jedi aren’t?
The Jedi are selfless. They care about others.
Have you ever heard of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
No, I thought not.
It’s not a story the Jedi will tell you.
It's a Sith legend.
Darth Plagueis sat chachan...
as powerful and intelligent as a dark lord Sith, .
he can use the Force to overwhelm the midi-chlorians...
to do... live.
He had such knowledge of the dark side,
and those he cared about would keep it…
rather than death.
Can it really… save people from death?
The dark side of the Force is the path to many good things…
others see it as unnatural.
What happened to him?
He became very strong,
what he was afraid of was.
losing its power.
That eventually did, of course.
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew.
Then his student killed him in his sleep.
It’s ironic enough.
He could have saved others from death,
but not himself.
Can we learn from that energy?
Not in a Jedi.
All Red units, right here!
Palpatine thinks General Grievous is in Utapau?
Part of the message was intercepted in a diplomatic package…
It came from the head of Utapau.
We must act accordingly.
Capturing General Grievous will end this battle.
We must move forward quickly and decisively.
The Chancellor requested… that I lead the campaign.
The council will decide for itself who should go,
there is no chancellor.
A teacher is needed, with more experience.
I’m going to agree. Master Kenobi has to go.
- I agree with you. - Ayxa.
Oh.
They were very nice. Council is adjourned .
The droids start their massive power generators .
And now the time has come, Commander. Yes, sir.
Charge!
Head for the cover!
You will need me on this, Master. I agree with you.
But it might just be a wild bantha chase. Teacher.
I let you down. I do not thank you enough for teaching me.
I am proud, and I apologize.
I just got very frustrated with the council.
Anakin, you are strong and wise, and I am very proud of you.
I've taught you since I was a little boy.
I teach you everything I know.
And you turned out to be a biggerJedi than I ever expected.
But be patient, Anakin.
It won’t be long before the council makes him a Jedi master.
Obi-Wan and more . May the power be with you.
Good morning, old friend. May the power be with you.
Fortunately, most countries on this small continent are concentrated here.
In the distance. I’ll distract them until I get there.
But don't take too long. Come on. When have I let you down?
They were very nice.
The burden is on me to not destroy all the droids until I reach.
Save your energy.
I can't.
Don't give up, Padmé.
Obi-Wan is here, right?
He came from there this morning.
What did he want to do?
He’s worried about you.
He says he was devastated.
I feel lost.
Lost? What do you mean?
Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.
They trust you with their lives.
What's going on.
I’m not a Jedi, I should be.
I want more of it.
And I know I shouldn't.
You are expecting too much of yourself.
I found a way to save you. Are you saving me?
From my nightmares.
Does that bother you?
I will not lose you, Padmé.
I won’t die in childbirth, Ani.
I’ve promised you. No, I promise you.
Greetings, young Jedi.
What brought you to our distant sanctuary?
Unfortunately, the struggle.
There's no argument here-just bring it with you.
With your kind permission, I need some fuel...
and to use your city as a base as you search systems nearby for General Grievous .
He’s already here. We are being held hostage.
They're looking at us. I understand.
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.
Tell your men to hide.
If you have warriors, now is the time.
Send the fighter back to the ship. Tell Cody I made contact.
Can he bring in other fighters? He didn't say anything.
It won’t be long before the armies of the Republic are chasing us here.
I send you the Mustafar system on the outer tire.
It’s a volcanic planet.
You will be safe there. Left?
Hmph! Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape you, General.
Without Count Dooku, I doubt you'll be safe.
Thank you, Viceroy, .
you are not in my hands.
Your ship is waiting.
Good morning, guys.
General Kenobi .
You are a brave man.
Kill him off.
After the installation.
I personally have to deal with this Jedi slime.
Your departure.
You are unreasonable.
I was trained in the Jedi arts by Count Dooku.
Attack , Kenobi .
Go, go, go, go! You have to change it! You have to change it!
Everyone is coming out. Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.
You have to bury yourself. Come on.
You have to change it! You have to change it!
Come on, get going! Come on, everyone!
Army or not, .
you must realize that you are destroyed.
I don't think so.
¡Hyah!
Stitch the corner.
Master Windu, can I stop you?
General Kenobi's interview with General Grievous,
and we began the attack.
Thank you, Commander.
Anakin, get this news to the chancellor.
As far as he is concerned, a clue as to their intentions will help.
Yes, Teacher.
I understand there's a plan to destroy the Jedi .
The dark side of the Force surrounded the chancellor .
If he doesn't give up his power to weaken Grievous after it's destroyed,
and be removed from office.
The Jedi Council should take control of the senate…
so that there can be a peaceful transition.
It's a dark place this line of thinking will take us.
We must be careful.
The Chancellor.
We just received a message from Master Kenobi.
He hires General Grievous.
We'll just have to wait until Professor Kenobi gets to the point.
I need to be there with him.
I find it disheartening that the council has.
can’t fully appreciate your skills.
Don't you ever wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?
I'm going to know.
More and more I feel like this…
I was kicked out of the council.
I knew there were things about the Force that I wasn’t told.
They don't trust you, Anakin.
They see your future.
They know your power is too strong to control.
Break through the fog of lies the Jedis are spreading around you.
Let me help you understand the subtleties of the Force .
How do you know the ways of the Force?
My mentor taught me all about the Force.
Also the nature of the dark side .
Do you know the dark side?
Anakin , 1999 .
if anyone wants to understand the great secret,
one must be aware of all aspects,
not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi .
If you want to become a complete knowledge manager,
you'll get a wider view of the Force .
TheJedi, Anakin.
Only through me.
you can gain greater power than anyJedi.
Learn to recognize the dark side of the Force, .
and you saved your wife…
some of the deaths.
What do you think of the snowflake?
Use my knowledge. I beg you, please.
You are the Sith father.
I know what is troubling you. Listen to me, please.
You can’t continue being a pawn of the Jedi Council.
You've been looking for a life since I met you...
greater than an ordinaryJedi.
Important life, .
thinking about consciousness.
- Do you want to kill him? - I really want to.
I know you can do that.
I can understand your anger.
It gives you focus, .
it is more encouraging.
I would hand it over to the Jedi Council. Of course. You have to do that.
But you don’t really know their intentions, do you?
I will find out the truth about all of this soon.
You are clever, Anakin.
Know the power of the dark side.
Chance to save Padmé .
Aaaah!
It’s so uncivilized.
Master Windu, I need to talk to you.
Skywalker, we just got word that Obi-Wan destroyed General Grievous.
We're on track to have the chancellor restore emergency power back to the senate.
He won't give up his power. I just learned a scary truth.
I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord.
A Sith father?
If. The one you are looking for.
How do you know that? He knows the ways of the Force.
He's been trained to use the dark side.
Are you sure you are right? Exactly.
Then our worst fears are realized.
We must move quickly to keep the Jedi order alive.
Master, the chancellor is very strong.
If you want to capture him, you will need my help.
Stay away from this affair for your own good.
I've got a big problem with you, young Skywalker.
There is so much fear clouding your judgment.
I must go, Master. No.
If what you say is true,
you will earn my confidence.
But stay here for now.
Wait in council chambers until we return.
Yes, Teacher.
You know, right,
if theJedi destroy me,
any chance to save him will be lost.

Teacher Windu. I thought General Grievous was destroyed then.
I must say you're here sooner than expected.
On behalf of the Galactic Senate of the Republic,
you are under arrest, Chancellor.
Are you threatening me, MasterJedi?
The Senate must decide his fate.
- I'm in the senate. - Not yet.
It’s treason then.
You are arrested, sir.
Anakin, I told you it got here.
I'm sure it's true.
The Jedi take over.
The oppression of the Sith will never return.
You have been lost.
No.
No. No, you will die!
She’s a traitor!
He is the traitor!
I have the power to save whomever I want.
You have to choose.
Don't listen, Anakin!
Don’t let him kill you.
I can't hold it anymore.
I- III no. III'm weak.
I-I'm too strong.
Anakin was the name.
Please help us. Help us out!
I- II can no longer be held.
I want to finish this once and for all.
You can’t do that.
He must be judged.
He has control of the senate and the courts.
He is too dangerous to be left alive.
I am very strong. Don't kill me. Please.

Please don't do that.
I'm going to need him.

What do I do with my own?
You are fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.
Become my student.
Learn to use the dark side of the Force .
I will do whatever you ask.
Ok.

I won’t live without him.
Cheating death is a power that only one has,

I promised myself…

Ok.
The Force is strong with you.
A powerful Sith you can become.
From now on you will be known as…
Darth is.
Vader is a man.
Thank you, master.

Because the council doesn’t trust you, my young student,
I believe you're the onlyJedi that doesn't know this plot.
When the Jedi find out what happened here,
they will kill me,
with all the senators.
I agree with you.
The next step of the council will be against the senate.
Every single Jedi, .
including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi,
now an enemy of the Republic.
I understand, Master.
We must get up quickly.
The Jedi are relentless.
Unless all are destroyed, it will be an endless civil war.
First I want to go to the Jedi temple.
We’ll catch them off balance.
Do what you have to do, Lord Vader.
Don't hesitate. Don't be merciful.
You'll be strong with the dark side...
To save Padmé.
What about the otherJedi spreading across the galaxy?
Their betrayal will be solved.
After killing all the Jedi in the temple,

Eliminate Viceroy Gunray…
and other fall leaders.
Once again the Sith will rule the galaxy!
And...
we will… find peace.

Come on. Let’s go!

Are you okay with it? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi temple.
You could see the smoke from here. I'm fine. I'm fine.
I came to see if you and the baby were safe. What’s going on?
The Jedi are trying to destroy the Republic.
I don't believe that.
I saw Professor Windu try to kill the Chancellor myself.

I will not betray the Republic.
My loyalty lies with the chancellor…

Well, he's under a lot of stress, R2.

No, thank you, 3 PO.

How many otherJedi managed to escape?
Heard we don't have anyone.
I see thousands of soldiers attacking the Jedi temple.
So I went looking for Yoda.
Do we have any contact from the temple?
We received a coded withdrawal message.
He asks all the Jedi to return to the temple.
It says the war is over. Okay, so let's go back.
Any remaining humans will be trapped and killed.
Suggest deleting the coded signal, right?
Yes, Teacher. There are many things.
I agree with you.
And a little more knowledge may light our path.
The plan went as you stated, sir.
You have done well, Viceroy.
