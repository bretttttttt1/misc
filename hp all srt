00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,000
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

3
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,400
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,899
Are the rumors true, Albus?

5
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,299
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

6
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,799
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

7
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,199
Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid
with something as important as this?

8
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,299
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

10
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,399
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

11
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,200
Little tyke fell asleep just
as we were flying over Bristol.

12
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,400
Try not to wake him.

13
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,300
There you go.

14
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,199
Albus, do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

15
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,699
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles, imaginable.

16
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,899
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

17
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,499
This boy will be famous. There won't be a child
in our world who doesn't know his name.

18
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,999
Exactly.

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,600
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

20
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Until he's ready.

21
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,300
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

22
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,700
Good luck...

23
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,800
...Harry Potter.

24
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,400
Up. Get up!

25
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,600
Now!

26
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,600
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

27
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,100
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

28
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,999
Why don't you just cook the breakfast,
and try not to burn anything.

29
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,199
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

30
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,299
...for my Dudley's special day!

31
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,600
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

32
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,900
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

33
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,499
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

34
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,899
36?! But last year... last year I had 37!

35
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,481
But some of them are quite a
bit bigger than last year's.

36
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:27,999
I don't care how big they are!

37
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,699
Oh, now, now, now. This is
what we're going to do...

38
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,400
...is that when we go out, we're going to buy
you two new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

39
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:43,000
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

40
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,099
I'm warning you now, boy.

41
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,699
Any funny business, any at all...

42
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,100
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

43
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,600
Get in.

44
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,200
Make it move.

45
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,499
Move!

46
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,199
- Move!
- He's asleep!

47
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,000
He's boring.

48
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,799
Sorry about him.

49
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there day after day...

50
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,200
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

51
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,600
Can you hear me?

52
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,200
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

53
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,999
Do you...?

54
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,400
I mean, do you talk to people often?

55
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,699
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

56
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,300
Do you miss your family?

57
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,799
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

58
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,100
Mummy, Dad, come here! you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

59
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,099
Thanks.

60
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,900
Anytime.

61
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,100
Snake!

62
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,899
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

63
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,300
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

64
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,900
Who did this? How did you get
in there? ls there a snake?

65
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,100
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

66
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,699
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

67
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,800
One minute the glass was there and
then it was gone, it was like magic.

68
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,000
There's no such thing as magic.

69
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,200
And smile!

70
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,499
Vernon, just look at him!
I can't believe it!

71
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,199
In just a week, he'll be off to Smeltings.

72
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,199
Caveat Smeltonia.
Proudest moment of my life.

73
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,600
Will I have to wear that too?

74
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,900
What? You? Go to Smeltings?

75
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,899
Don't be so stupid! You're going to go
to the state school. Where you belong.

76
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,599
This is what you'll going to be wearing,
when I finish dyeing it.

77
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,099
That's Dudley's old uniform.
It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.

78
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,699
It'll fit you well enough.

79
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,700
Go get the post. Go!

80
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,199
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

81
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,599
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- Hey, give it back! It's mine!

82
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

83
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,500
No more mail through this letterbox.

84
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,000
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

85
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Shoo! Go on.

86
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,200
Fine day, Sunday.

87
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,499
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

88
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,099
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

89
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,200
No post on Sunday.

90
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,500
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

91
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,000
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

92
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,300
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

93
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,000
Make it stop, please!

94
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,800
Stop it!

95
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,800
Mummy, what's happening?

96
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,600
Give me that! Give me that letter!

97
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,000
Get off!

98
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,900
They're my letters! Let go of me!

99
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,800
That's it! We're going away!

100
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,999
Far away, where they can't find us!

101
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

102
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,800
Make a wish, Harry.

103
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,900
Who's there?

104
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,500
Sorry about that.

105
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,000
I demand that you leave at once, Sir!
You are breaking and entering!

106
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,700
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

107
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,299
Mind, I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

108
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,099
But you're a bit more along than I would have
expected. Particularly 'round the middle.

109
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm not Harry.

110
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,800
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

111
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,999
Got something for you.

112
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,900
Afraid I might have sat on it at somepoint,
but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same.

113
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,800
Baked it myself, words and all.

114
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,399
Thank you.

115
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,800
It's not every day that your young man
turns 11, now is it?

116
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,999
Excuse me, who are you?

117
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,199
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

118
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,200
- Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

119
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,699
No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

120
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,299
Learnt what?

121
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,100
You're a wizard, Harry.

122
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,299
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

123
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,599
And a thumping good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up little.

124
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,699
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

125
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,000
...l can't be a wizard.

126
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,400
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

127
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,399
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

128
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,300
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

129
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,799
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to inform you...

130
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,199
...that you have been accepted at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

131
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,399
He will not be going there! We swore when we
took him in we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

132
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,799
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

133
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,099
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

134
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,999
My perfect sister being who she was.

135
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,199
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

136
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,599
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

137
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,499
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

138
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,399
A freak!

139
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,599
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

140
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,499
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

141
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,699
And then, if you please, she went and got
herself blown up! And we got landed with you.

142
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,999
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

143
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,499
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

144
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,599
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! It's a scandal!

145
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,299
He'll not be going.

146
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,799
Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's
going to stop him, are you?

147
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,100
Muggle?

148
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,399
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down ever since he were born.

149
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,499
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry in the world and...

150
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,599
...he'll be under the finest headmaster that
Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore.

151
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,599
I will not pay to have some crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

152
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,399
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

153
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,700
...in front of me.

154
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,799
Oh, um, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

155
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,200
- Strickly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

156
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,500
Ooh, We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

157
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,900
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

158
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,800
"First year's students will require
three sets of plain work robes...

159
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,799
...one wand."

160
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,099
Essential bit of equipment, Harry.

161
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,099
"One pair of dragon hide gloves."
Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?

162
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,600
They don't mean a penguin, do they?

163
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,800
- Crikey. I'd love a dragon.
- You'd like a dragon?

164
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,900
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.
Vastly misunderstood.

165
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,099
"All students must be equipped with...

166
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,299
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

167
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:40,299
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

168
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,099
Can we find all this in London?

169
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,800
If you know where to go.

170
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,399
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

171
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,499
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

172
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,899
Just helping young Harry here
buy his school supplies.

173
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,700
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

174
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,399
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

175
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,000
Doris Crockford, Mr Potter.
I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.

176
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,599
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

177
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,399
Hello, professor. I didn't see you there.

178
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,599
Harry, This is Professor Quirrell. He will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

179
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,299
Oh, nice to meet you.

180
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,499
Fearfully fascinating subject.

181
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

182
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,499
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

183
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Goodbye.

184
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,699
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous, Hagrid?

185
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,399
All those people back there,
how is it they know who I am?

186
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,500
I'm not sure I'm exactly the right person
to tell you that, Harry.

187
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,300
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

188
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,099
Here's where you'll get your quills and your ink.

189
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,300
And over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing your wizardry.

190
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,299
It's a world-class racing broom.

191
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,499
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

192
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,000
It's the fastest model yet.

193
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,299
But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

194
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,899
Well there's your money, Harry.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

195
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,600
Tain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

196
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,199
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

197
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,699
They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come
goblins but not the most friendly of beasts.

198
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,900
Best stay close.

199
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,600
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

200
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,000
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

201
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,200
Oh, Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

202
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,799
Ha! Here's the little devil.

203
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,000
Oh, and there's something else as well.

204
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,500
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

205
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,700
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

206
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,900
Very well.

207
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,000
Vault 687.

208
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,200
Lamp, please.

209
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
Key, please.

210
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Didn't think your mum and dad
will leave you with nothing, now did ya?

211
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,099
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

212
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,499
Can't tell you, Harry.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

213
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,400
Stand back.

214
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,500
Best not to mention this to anyone, Harry.

215
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,699
I still need... a wand.

216
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,400
A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

217
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,300
Why don't you run along there and wait. I just
got one more thing I gotta do. Won't be long.

218
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,100
Hello?

219
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,900
Hello?

220
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,700
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

221
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,699
It seems only yesterday...

222
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:47,800
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

223
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,800
Here we are.

224
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,900
Give it a wave.

225
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,900
Apparently not.

226
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,600
Perhaps...

227
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,400
...this.

228
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,000
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

229
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,900
I wonder...

230
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,299
Curious.

231
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,399
Very curious.

232
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,800
Sorry, but what's curious?

233
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,799
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

234
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,699
It so happens that the phoenix...

235
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,800
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

236
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,099
Just one other.

237
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,699
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

238
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,700
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

239
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,800
And who owned that wand?

240
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,000
We do not speak his name.

241
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,899
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

242
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,200
It's not always clear why.

243
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,999
But I think it is clear...

244
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,099
...that we can expect
great things from you.

245
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,599
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

246
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,499
...did great things.

247
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,800
Terrible...

248
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,500
...yes, but great.

249
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,200
Harry! Harry!

250
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,900
Happy birthday.

251
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,600
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

252
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,399
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

253
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,400
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

254
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,699
First, and understand this Harry
because it's very important:

255
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,499
Not all wizards are good.

256
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,199
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

257
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,399
...there was a one wizard who went as bad
as he can go. His name was V...

258
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,199
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

259
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,299
No, I can't spell it.

260
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,800
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

261
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,100
It was dark times, Harry. Dark times.

262
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,499
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

263
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,100
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

264
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,600
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

265
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,699
Your parents fought against him.

266
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,800
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

267
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,599
Nobody, not one.

268
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,300
Except you.

269
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,400
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

270
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,099
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

271
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,999
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.

272
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
What happened to V...?
To You-Know-Who?

273
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,399
Well, some say he died.

274
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,999
Codswallop, in my opinion.

275
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,499
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

276
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,599
...too tired to carry on.

277
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,299
But one thing's absolutely certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

278
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,800
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

279
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You're the boy who lived.

280
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What are you looking at?

281
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,699
Blimey, is that the time?

282
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,899
Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

283
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,999
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes.

284
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,600
Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry
that's very important. Stick to your ticket.

285
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,699
Platform 9 3/4?

286
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,699
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

287
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,300
There's no such thing, is there?

288
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,400
Sorry.

289
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,599
Excuse me. Excuse me.

290
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,399
Right on your left Madam.

291
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,399
Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

292
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,099
9 3/4? Think you're being funny, do ya?

293
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,800
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles, Of course. Come on!

294
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,600
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

295
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,400
All right, Percy, you first.

296
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,499
Fred, you next.

297
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,499
- He's not Fred, I am.
- Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?

298
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,700
Oh, I'm sorry, George.

299
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,300
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

300
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,600
Excuse me.

301
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,399
Could you tell me how to...?

302
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,199
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

303
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,899
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

304
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,999
All you've got do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

305
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,800
- Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

306
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,499
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

307
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,000
Not at all.

308
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,499
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

309
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,400
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

310
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,699
So it's true!

311
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,800
I mean, do you really have the...?

312
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,300
- The what?
- The scar?

313
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,700
Wicked!

314
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,300
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

315
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,600
We'll take the lot.

316
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:22,200
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

317
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,899
There's chocolate
and peppermint and there's also...

318
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,899
...spinach, liver and tripe.

319
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,400
George sweared he got
a bogey-flavoured one once!

320
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,779
These aren't real
frogs, are they?

321
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,299
It's just a spell. Besides,
It's the cards you want.

322
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:50,100
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

323
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,900
Watch it!

324
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,800
Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them to begin with.

325
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,400
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

326
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,699
Hey, he's gone!

327
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,400
Well, you can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

328
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,099
This is Scabbers, by the way.
Pathetic, isn't he?

329
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,499
Just a little bit.

330
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,999
Fred gave me a spell as
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

331
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,400
Yeah.

332
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,700
Has anyone seen a toad?

333
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,800
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

334
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,700
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

335
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,999
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow.

336
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,400
Turn this stupid fat rat yellow.

337
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,699
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

338
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,199
Of course, I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

339
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,100
...but they've all worked for me.

340
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,800
For example:

341
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Oculus Reparo.

342
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,600
That's better, isn't it?

343
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,699
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

344
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,500
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

345
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,399
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

346
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,800
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

347
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,299
You've got dirt on your nose, by the way.
Did you know?

348
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,500
Just there.

349
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,599
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

350
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:07,100
Come on, now, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

351
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,000
- Hello, Harry.
- Hey, Hagrid.

352
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,500
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on, now, follow me.

353
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,000
Wicked.

354
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,299
Welcome to Hogwarts.

355
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,499
Now, in a few moments, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

356
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:49,699
But before you can take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

357
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,099
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

358
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,800
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

359
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,300
Now, while you're here, your house
will be like your family.

360
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,299
Your triumphs will earn you points.

361
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,699
Any rule-breaking,
and you will lose points.

362
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:17,299
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points is awarded the house cup.

363
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,800
Trevor!

364
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,299
Sorry.

365
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,600
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

366
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,200
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

367
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,199
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

368
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,900
Harry Potter?

369
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,099
This is Crabbe, and Goyle.

370
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,699
And I'm Malfoy.

371
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,400
Draco Malfoy.

372
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,799
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

373
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,900
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

374
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,799
We'll soon find out that some wizarding families
are better than others, Potter.

375
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,799
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

376
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,300
I can help you there.

377
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,300
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

378
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,200
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

379
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,200
It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched
to look like the night sky.

380
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,500
I read about it
in Hogwarts: A History.

381
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,600
All right, will you wait along here, please?

382
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,699
Now, before we begin...

383
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,099
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

384
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:23,200
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

385
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,699
The first years, please note...

386
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:31,999
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

387
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,699
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

388
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:42,599
...that the third-floor corridor on the
right hand side is out of bounds...

389
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,200
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

390
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,500
Thank you.

391
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,199
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

392
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,099
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

393
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,499
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

394
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,400
Hermione Granger.

395
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,300
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

396
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,000
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

397
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,299
Ah, right then... hmm... right.

398
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,200
Okay. Gryffindor!

399
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,800
Draco Malfoy.

400
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,600
Slytherin!

401
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,299
There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad
who wasn't in Slytherin.

402
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,200
Susan Bones.

403
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,799
Harry, what is it?

404
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,799
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

405
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,399
Let's see...

406
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,100
I know! Hufflepuff!

407
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,200
Ronald Weasley.

408
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,100
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

409
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,100
Gryffindor!

410
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,800
Harry Potter.

411
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,799
Hmm... difficult, very difficult.

412
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,899
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

413
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,499
There's talent, oh, yes.

414
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,499
And a thirst to prove yourself.

415
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,000
But where to put you?

416
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,999
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

417
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,899
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

418
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,899
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

419
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:39,599
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatnesses, no doubt about that.

420
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,499
No? Well, if you're sure.

421
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,399
Better be...

422
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,700
...Gryffindor!

423
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,000
Your attention, please.

424
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,700
Let the feast begin.

425
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,099
I'm half and half.

426
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,599
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

427
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,400
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

428
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,199
Say, Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

429
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,499
Oh, thats Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

430
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,699
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

431
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:03,600
But everyone knows, its the Dark Arts he fancies.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

432
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,399
Hello! How are you?

433
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,000
Welcome to Gryffindor.

434
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,600
Look, It's the Bloody Baron!

435
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,999
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

436
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,700
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

437
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,599
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

438
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,499
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

439
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,300
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

440
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,600
Like this.

441
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,399
Gryffindors, follow me please.
Keep up. Thank you.

442
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,999
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

443
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,299
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

444
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,000
Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

445
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:35,799
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

446
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,699
That picture's moving.

447
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,500
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

448
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,499
- Oh, look! Look!
- Who's that girl?

449
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,400
Welcome to Hogwarts.

450
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,000
Password?

451
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,200
Caput Draconis.

452
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,800
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

453
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,000
Gather around here.

454
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,899
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

455
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,499
Boys' dormitory is upstairs and down to your left.
Girls, the same on your right.

456
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,900
You'll find that your belongings have
already been brought up.

457
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,699
Made it!

458
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:54,400
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

459
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:02,499
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley.

460
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,974
Perhaps, lt'd be more useful
if I were to transfigure

461
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,999
Mr. Potter and yourself
into a pocket-watch.

462
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,399
- That way, one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

463
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,500
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

464
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,299
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

465
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,099
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

466
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,099
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

467
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,400
However, for those select few...

468
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,700
...who possess the predisposition...

469
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,499
...l can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

470
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,699
...and ensnare the senses.

471
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,499
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

472
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:04,700
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

473
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,499
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts in...

474
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:19,699
...possession of abilities so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

475
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,900
...to not pay attention.

476
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,500
Mr. Potter.

477
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,500
Our new celebrity.

478
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,500
Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

479
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,099
You don't know? Well, let's try again.

480
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:55,000
Where, Mr Potter, would you look
if I asked you to find me a bezoar?

481
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,699
I don't know, Sir.

482
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,800
And what is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

483
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,600
I don't know, Sir.

484
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,000
Pity.

485
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,900
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

486
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,499
...is it, Mr. Potter?

487
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:22,700
Clearly, Hermione knows.
Seems a pity not to ask her.

488
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,000
Silence.

489
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,100
Put your hand down,
you silly girl!

490
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,999
For your information, Potter...

491
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,669
...asphodel and wormwood
make a sleeping potion so

492
00:55:47,695 --> 00:55:50,599
powerful it is known as the
Draught of the Living Dead.

493
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:56,199
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of
a goat and it will save you from most poisons.

494
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:03,100
As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same
plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.

495
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,900
Well...

496
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:12,300
...why aren't you all
copying this down?

497
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,599
And Gryffindors...

498
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,099
...note that five points will
be taken from your house...

499
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,700
...for your classmate's cheek.

500
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:52,800
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum.

501
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,500
Eye of rabbit...

502
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,499
What's Seamus trying to do
to that glass of water?

503
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,500
Turn it into rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

504
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,100
Mail's here.

505
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,400
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

506
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,399
Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall.

507
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:59,200
I've read about those. When the smoke turns
red, it means you've forgotten something.

508
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,899
The only problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

509
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,599
Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts.
Listen.

510
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,499
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches unknown...

511
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:16,399
...Gringotts goblins while acknowledging
the breach, insist nothing was taken.

512
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,299
The vault in question, number 713, had, in fact,
been emptied earlier that very same day."

513
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,900
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

514
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:39,499
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

515
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,600
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

516
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,199
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

517
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,399
Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step
up to the left side of their broomstick.

518
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,199
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

519
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,399
Up!

520
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,600
Up.

521
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,900
Up.

522
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,199
Up. Up!

523
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,500
With feeling.

524
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,199
Shut up, Harry.

525
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,999
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

526
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,300
And grip it tight, you don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

527
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,599
When I blow my whistle, I want each of you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

528
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,599
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

529
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:42,199
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

530
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,600
On my whistle. Three, two...

531
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,400
Mr. Longbottom.

532
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,799
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

533
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,400
Neville!

534
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,800
Come back down this instant!

535
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,100
Everyone out of the way!

536
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,899
Is he all right?

537
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:49,900
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

538
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:55,799
Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground
while I take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.

539
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,599
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

540
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:05,099
...the one riding it will find themselves out
of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch.

541
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,199
Did you see his face?

542
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,299
Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze,
he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse.

543
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,100
Give it here, Malfoy.

544
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,600
No. I think I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

545
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,300
How about on the roof?

546
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:30,300
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

547
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:36,499
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

548
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,699
Besides, you don't even know how to fly.

549
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,900
What an idiot.

550
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,799
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

551
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,200
Is that so?

552
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,600
Have it your way, then.

553
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,899
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

554
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,200
Harry Potter!

555
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,200
Follow me.

556
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,100
You wait here.

557
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:59,099
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment please?

558
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,200
Oh, yes, of course.

559
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:12,600
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

560
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,199
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

561
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,700
I always knew he'd do well.

562
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:25,099
Seeker? But first years
never make their house teams.

563
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:29,799
- You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
- A century, according to McGonagall.

564
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,599
Hey, well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

565
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,399
Fred and George are on the team too.
Beaters.

566
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,299
Our job is to make sure that you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

567
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,199
Can't make any promises, of course.
Rough game, Quidditch.

568
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,299
Brutal, But no one's died in years.
Someone will vanishes occasionally.

569
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,299
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

570
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:55,199
Oh, go on Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

571
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,700
But I've never even played Quidditch.
What if I make a fool of myself?

572
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,900
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

573
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:16,300
Harry, you never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

574
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,300
I didn't know.

575
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:28,299
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

576
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,900
Who doesn't?

577
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,899
What's happening?

578
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:38,400
The staircases change, remember?

579
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:48,300
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

580
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,299
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

581
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,599
We're not supposed to be here.

582
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:05,900
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

583
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,600
Let's go.

584
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,700
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

585
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,800
Quick, let's hide through that door!

586
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,899
- It's locked!
- Thats it, We're done for!

587
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,400
Oh, move over!

588
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,500
Alohomora.

589
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,300
Get in.

590
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,499
Alohomora?

591
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,299
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

592
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,900
Anyone here, my sweet?

593
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,200
Come on.

594
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,499
- Filch is gone.
- Probably thinks this door's locked.

595
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,400
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

596
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:30,499
What do they think they're doing? Keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school.

597
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,399
You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see
what it was standing on?

598
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,699
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was a bit preoccupied with its heads.

599
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,799
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

600
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,699
It was standing on a trap door.
Which means it wasn't there by accident.

601
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:49,500
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

602
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:53,599
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

603
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,499
...before either of you come up with
another clever idea to get us killed.

604
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,900
Or worse, expelled.

605
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:08,400
She needs to sort out her priorities.

606
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,199
Quidditch is easy enough to understand.
Each team has seven players.

607
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:23,200
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

608
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,299
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

609
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:38,499
Now, the Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those three hoops.

610
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:42,999
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

611
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,800
I think so. What are those?

612
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,300
You better take this.

613
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,100
Careful now, it's coming back.

614
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,300
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

615
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,300
What was that?

616
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,699
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

617
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:42,500
But you are a Seeker.

618
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:50,599
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

619
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,299
The Golden Snitch.

620
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,599
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

621
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,799
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

622
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,899
What do I do with it?

623
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,399
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

624
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,099
You catch this, the game's over.

625
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:13,300
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

626
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:27,599
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

627
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,799
...or the ability to make objects fly.

628
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,499
Do you have your feathers? Good.

629
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:39,799
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

630
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,500
The swish and flick. Everyone.

631
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:49,700
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

632
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,700
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

633
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,199
Wingardium Leviosa.

634
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,800
Wingardium Leviosa.

635
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:08,799
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

636
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:15,100
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

637
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,900
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

638
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,200
Wingardium Leviosa.

639
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:37,299
Oh, well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

640
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,200
Splendid!

641
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,000
Well done, dear.

642
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,300
I think we're going to need
another feather over here, Professor.

643
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:01,999
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

644
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,700
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

645
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,900
I think she heard you.

646
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,599
Where's Hermione?

647
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,899
Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't
come out of the girl's bathroom.

648
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:49,300
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

649
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,299
Troll! In the dungeon!

650
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,900
Troll in the dungeon!

651
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,100
Thought you ought to know.

652
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,800
Silence!

653
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,400
Everyone will please not panic!

654
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,599
Now...

655
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:28,400
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

656
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,900
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

657
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:48,099
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

658
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,999
How could a troll get in?

659
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,399
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

660
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:59,700
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

661
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,100
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

662
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,100
It's going into the girl's bathroom.

663
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,500
Hermione, move!

664
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,000
Help! Help!

665
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,100
Hey, pea brain!

666
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,400
Help!

667
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,900
Do something!

668
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,300
- What?
- Anything!

669
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,299
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

670
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,900
Wingardium Leviosa.

671
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,800
Cool.

672
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,999
Is it dead?

673
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,200
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

674
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,800
Troll bogies.

675
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,799
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

676
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:58,700
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

677
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,100
Miss Granger?

678
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,899
I went looking for the troll.
I'd read about them and thought I could handle it.

679
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,999
But I was wrong.

680
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,400
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

681
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:20,699
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

682
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:26,599
I would've expected more rational behavior on your
part and am very disappointed in you, Ms. Granger.

683
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,799
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

684
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,700
...for your serious lack of judgment.

685
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,999
As for you two gentlemen...

686
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,699
...l just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

687
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,299
Not many first-year students
could take on a full grown mountain troll...

688
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,199
...and live to tell the tale.

689
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,900
Five points...

690
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,400
...will be awarded to each of you...

691
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:58,100
...for sheer dumb luck.

692
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,400
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

693
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:21,100
- Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.
- Mind you, we did save her life.

694
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:25,899
Mind you, she might not have needed saving
if you hadn't insulted her.

695
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:29,500
What are friends for?

696
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:34,299
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

697
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,699
Ron's right, Harry.
You're gonna need your strength today.

698
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,200
I'm not hungry.

699
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:46,299
Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now
that you've proven yourself against a troll.

700
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:49,699
A little game of Quidditch
should be easy work for you.

701
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:53,100
Even if it is against Slytherin.

702
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,200
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

703
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:08,699
Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

704
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:11,499
...so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog.

705
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,499
But, he got himself bitten,
that's why he's limping.

706
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,100
But why would anyone go near that dog?

707
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,899
The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of one of the vaults.

708
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:24,299
He said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

709
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,699
So you're saying...

710
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:30,500
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

711
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:47,600
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

712
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,700
Let's open it.

713
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,100
It's a broomstick.

714
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:06,000
That's not just a broomstick, Harry,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

715
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,500
But who...?

716
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,599
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

717
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,499
That's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

718
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:41,299
- What happened?
- Er, I don't really remember.

719
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:44,099
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

720
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,300
Woke up in the hospital a week later.

721
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:12,699
Hello! Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

722
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:17,800
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

723
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:50,399
The players take their positions
as madam Hooch...

724
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,399
...steps out onto
the field to begin the game!

725
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,000
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

726
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,100
...from all of you!

727
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,099
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

728
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,999
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

729
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,100
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

730
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:26,300
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

731
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:49,800
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

732
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,300
Well done!

733
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:06,400
Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

734
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:41,200
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

735
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,900
Give me that!

736
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Take that side!

737
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,700
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

738
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,699
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

739
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:39,400
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

740
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,700
Come on, Hermione!

741
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:20,600
Lacarnum lnflamarae.

742
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,700
Fire! You're on fire!

743
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,700
Go, go, go, go!

744
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,100
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

745
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,499
He's got the Snitch!

746
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:51,799
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

747
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,800
Gryffindor wins!

748
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:41,499
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

749
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:45,699
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?

750
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:48,299
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

751
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:52,199
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he's got a name. He's mine.

752
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,795
I bought him off an lrish feller
I met down at the pub last year.

753
01:27:54,796 --> 01:27:56,651
Then I lent him to
Dumbledore to guard the...

754
01:27:56,652 --> 01:27:57,352
Yes?

755
01:27:57,425 --> 01:27:59,375
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions!

756
01:27:59,376 --> 01:28:02,625
Don't ask any more questions.
That's top-secret, that is.

757
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:06,899
But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

758
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:10,800
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

759
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:16,299
Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

760
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:20,099
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

761
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,700
Exactly.

762
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,999
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

763
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,899
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

764
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:36,199
What that dog is guarding is strictly
between Prof. Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

765
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,900
Nicholas Flamel?

766
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:43,499
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

767
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,799
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

768
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,100
I don't know.

769
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:11,699
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

770
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,699
Ring the Hogwart bell.

771
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:17,699
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

772
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:21,000
Cast a Christmas spell.

773
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:37,900
Knight to e5.

774
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,800
Queen to e5.

775
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,800
That's totally barbaric!

776
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:58,899
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

777
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,600
I see you haven't.

778
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:06,099
Change of plans. My parents decided to go
to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie.

779
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:10,099
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry, then.

780
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:13,699
He's going to go and look in the library
for information on Nicholas Flamel.

781
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:17,500
We've looked a hundred times!

782
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:23,400
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

783
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:28,500
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

784
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:35,400
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

785
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:48,499
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

786
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,000
What are you wearing?

787
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,300
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

788
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,800
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

789
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,300
There they are.

790
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:22,799
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

791
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,200
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

792
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:47,699
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

793
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:51,000
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

794
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:57,599
My body's gone!

795
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,500
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

796
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,900
I'm invisible?

797
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:08,800
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

798
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,100
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

799
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:47,899
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

800
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:54,100
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

801
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,800
Who's there?

802
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:26,600
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

803
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,700
Who is it? Show yourself.

804
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,200
Severus, I...

805
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:30,699
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

806
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:35,700
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

807
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:56,099
We'll have another little chat soon.

808
01:34:56,100 --> 01:35:01,799
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

809
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:06,500
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

810
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:12,100
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

811
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:46,000
Mum?

812
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:51,200
Dad?

813
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:31,000
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

814
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:35,599
Ron, Ron, come on, get out of bed!

815
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,380
Why?

816
01:37:36,406 --> 01:37:39,525
There's something you've got to see.
Now, come on!

817
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:50,500
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

818
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:53,899
I only see us.

819
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:57,399
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

820
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:03,600
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

821
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,399
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

822
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:10,900
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

823
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:14,500
I look good.

824
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:18,799
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

825
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:24,100
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

826
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:40,000
Do you like yours, Ron?

827
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,900
- Ron?
- I'll be right back.

828
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:00,999
- Wanna play chess?
- No.

829
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,699
- Wanna go and visit Hagrid?
- No.

830
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:09,499
Harry, I know what you're thinking,
but don't.

831
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:13,700
There's something not right
about that mirror.

832
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:42,400
Back again, Harry?

833
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,899
I see that you,
like so many before you...

834
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:52,399
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

835
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:56,900
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

836
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:00,700
Let me give you a clue.

837
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,299
The happiest man on earth...

838
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:06,899
...would look into the mirror
and see only himself...

839
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:09,399
...exactly as he is.

840
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:14,699
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

841
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:17,800
Yes. And no.

842
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:21,099
It shows us nothing more or less...

843
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:27,299
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

844
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:32,299
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

845
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:36,299
...you see them standing beside you.

846
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,999
But remember this, Harry.

847
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:45,099
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

848
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:47,500
...or truth.

849
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:54,500
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

850
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:59,599
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

851
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,800
And I must ask you...

852
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:06,700
...not to go looking for it again.

853
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:10,600
It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry...

854
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,000
...and forget to live.

855
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,300
Hi, Hedwig.

856
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:17,899
Look at you, playing with your cards.
Pathetic!

857
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,199
We've got final exams coming up soon.

858
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,999
I'm ready. Ask me any question.

859
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,499
Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients
in a Forgetfulness Potion?

860
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:28,999
I forgot.

861
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,199
And what, may I ask, do you plan to do
if this comes up in the final exam?

862
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:34,499
- Copy off you.
- No, you won't.

863
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:37,444
Besides, according to Professor
McGonagall, we're to be

864
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:40,599
given special quills bewitched
with an Anti-Cheating Spell.

865
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:47,200
That's insulting! It's as if they
don't trust us! Dumbledore again!

866
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:54,900
- Leg-Locker Curse?
- Malfoy.

867
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:03,100
You have got to start
standing up to people, Neville.

868
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:06,799
How? I can barely stand at all!

869
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,100
I'll do the countercurse!

870
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:13,599
No, that's all I need!
You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!

871
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:17,199
I don't appreciate
the insinuation, Longbottom.

872
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:20,599
Besides, if anyone cared to notice...

873
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:25,200
...my eyebrows have
completely grown back!

874
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:30,599
I found him!

875
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:35,999
"Dumbledore is particularly famous for his
defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945."

876
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,680
Go on!

877
01:43:36,706 --> 01:43:39,399
"For the discovery of the
twelve uses of dragon blood...

878
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,699
...and his work on alchemy with his
partner, Nicholas Flamel"!

879
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:46,299
I knew the name sound familiar.
I read it on the train that day.

880
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:48,900
Follow me!

881
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:56,400
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

882
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:01,500
What about the countercurse?

883
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:08,599
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

884
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:11,899
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

885
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:14,200
This is light?

886
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:21,099
Of course! Here it is!

887
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:25,399
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

888
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,800
The what?

889
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:30,399
Honestly, don't you two read?

890
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:35,099
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

891
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,899
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

892
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:42,199
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

893
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,499
- lmmortal?
- It means you'll never die.

894
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,900
I know what it means!

895
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:52,399
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

896
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:57,900
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

897
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:01,699
That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor.

898
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:06,700
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

899
01:45:22,876 --> 01:45:23,576
Hagrid.

900
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,199
Oh, hello, sorry, don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.

901
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:30,200
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

902
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,642
We think Snape's
trying to steal it.

903
01:45:36,668 --> 01:45:39,899
Snape? Blimey, you're not
still on about him, are you?

904
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:43,000
Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone.
We just don't know why.

905
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:47,499
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He's not about to steal it.

906
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:48,799
What?

907
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,399
You heard. Right. Come on, now,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

908
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:55,299
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

909
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:59,399
Of course! There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

910
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,299
- Spells, enchantments.
- That's right.

911
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:05,499
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

912
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,799
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

913
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:11,699
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

914
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:15,600
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

915
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:34,499
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

916
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,699
I know what that is!

917
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:39,600
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

918
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:43,199
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

919
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:47,600
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

920
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:12,000
Is that...

921
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:13,899
...a dragon?

922
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:18,499
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

923
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:21,599
My brother Charlie works
with these in Romania.

924
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:26,800
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

925
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,199
Hello, Norbert.

926
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:33,800
- Norbert?
- Yeah, well, he's gotta have a name, don't he?

927
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:37,000
Don't you, Norbert?

928
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:47,100
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

929
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:53,100
Who's that?

930
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,900
Malfoy.

931
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:59,000
Oh, dear.

932
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:05,499
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
He told me so the first time I met him.

933
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:09,699
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

934
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:14,099
- I don't understand. ls that bad?
- It's bad.

935
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:16,600
Good evening.

936
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:23,099
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

937
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:26,799
...gives a student the right
to walk about the school at night.

938
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:31,899
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

939
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:34,500
- 50?!
- Each.

940
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,799
And to ensure it doesn't happen again...

941
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:41,400
...all four of you
will receive detention.

942
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:45,299
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

943
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,799
I thought you said the four of us.

944
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,499
No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy.

945
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:55,800
You see, honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

946
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,200
You will join your classmates
in detention.

947
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:14,299
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

948
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:19,299
There was a time detention would find you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

949
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:22,400
God, I miss the screaming.

950
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:28,199
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

951
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:33,800
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

952
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:38,800
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

953
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,300
Oh, good God, man, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

954
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:49,600
Norbert's gone.

955
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:53,699
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

956
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:57,099
Well, that's good, isn't it?
He'll be with his own kind.

957
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:59,699
Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?

958
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:04,200
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby, after all.

959
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:10,099
Oh, for God's sake, pull yourself together, man.
You're going into the Forest, after all.

960
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:12,599
Got to have your wits about you.

961
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:18,600
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

962
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:22,900
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

963
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:25,700
...werewolves.

964
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:29,299
There's more than werewolves
in those trees, lad.

965
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:32,300
You can be sure of that.

966
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:35,600
Nighty-night.

967
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:41,100
Right. Let's go.

968
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,599
Hagrid, what is that?

969
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:25,300
What we're here for.
See that?

970
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:31,200
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

971
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:36,300
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

972
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:49,499
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

973
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:52,900
Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.

974
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:56,600
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

975
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,099
Okay. Then I get Fang.

976
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:06,100
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

977
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:14,699
You wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

978
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:18,799
If I didn't know better, Draco,
I'd say you were scared.

979
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:21,700
I'm not scared, Potter.

980
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:24,800
Did you hear that?

981
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:28,699
Come on, Fang.

982
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,500
Scared!

983
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,600
What is it, Fang?

984
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:13,399
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

985
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:17,599
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

986
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:20,599
What was that thing you saved me from?

987
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:26,099
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

988
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:31,899
Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep
you alive even if you are an inch from death.

989
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:37,199
But at a terrible price. You
have slain something so pure...

990
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:42,199
...that from the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

991
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:44,199
A cursed life.

992
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:48,399
- But who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

993
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:53,699
Do you mean to say that
thing that killed the unicorn...

994
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:57,799
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

995
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:03,300
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter?

996
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,700
The Philosopher's Stone.

997
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:09,000
Harry!

998
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:13,999
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

999
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,500
You all right there, Harry?

1000
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:21,900
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

1001
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:26,600
You're safe now. Good luck.

1002
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:38,299
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

1003
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:41,299
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

1004
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:44,399
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

1005
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:48,999
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants the stone for Voldemort.

1006
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,699
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

1007
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:55,499
He'll come back.

1008
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,499
But if he comes back...

1009
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:01,800
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

1010
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:06,299
I think if he'd had the chance,
he might have tried to kill me tonight.

1011
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:10,099
And to think, I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

1012
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:13,999
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

1013
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:19,200
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

1014
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:24,999
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

1015
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,400
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

1016
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:40,399
I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams
were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.

1017
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:44,299
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

1018
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:49,699
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

1019
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:52,599
- Not like this.
- Perhaps you should see the nurse.

1020
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:56,400
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

1021
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:06,399
- Of course!
- What is it?

1022
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:10,299
Don't you think it's a bit odd that what
Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon...

1023
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:13,599
...and a stranger turns up who
just happens to have one?

1024
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:16,499
I mean, how many people wander around
with dragon eggs in their pockets?

1025
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:19,100
Why didn't I see it before?

1026
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:28,099
Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?
What did he look like?

1027
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:30,999
I don't know, I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

1028
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,900
The stranger, though, You and he
must have talked.

1029
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,899
Well, he wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

1030
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:42,099
I told him. I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

1031
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:46,900
- And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
- Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy.

1032
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,399
How often do you come across a
three-headed dog, even if you're in the trade?

1033
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:57,299
But I told him. I said, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

1034
01:57:57,300 --> 01:58:03,000
Take Fluffy, for example. Just play him a bit of
music and he falls straight to sleep.

1035
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:07,299
I shouldn't have told you that.

1036
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:09,800
Where are you going? Wait!

1037
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:19,600
We have to see Professor Dumbledore.
Immediately!

1038
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:22,599
I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here.

1039
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:27,299
He received an urgent owl from the
Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.

1040
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:30,099
He's gone? Now?
But this is important!

1041
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:32,600
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

1042
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:38,200
- How do you know...?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

1043
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:41,383
I don't know how you three
found out about the stone,

1044
01:58:41,409 --> 01:58:43,999
but I assure you it is
perfectly well protected.

1045
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,600
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

1046
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:59,599
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village.
It was Snape.

1047
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:02,499
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

1048
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:06,600
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

1049
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:11,699
Now, what would three young
Gryffindors such as yourselves...

1050
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:16,300
...be doing inside on a day like this?

1051
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:24,600
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.

1052
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:27,100
People will think you're...

1053
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:34,100
...up to something.

1054
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:46,299
Now what do we do?

1055
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:50,400
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

1056
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:05,599
Trevor.

1057
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:09,299
Trevor, shh! go! You shouldn't be here!

1058
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:14,899
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

1059
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:19,099
- Now, Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!

1060
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:23,899
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

1061
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:28,600
Neville, I'm really really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

1062
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:40,299
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

1063
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:44,200
Brilliant, but scary.

1064
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:46,799
Let's go.

1065
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:51,400
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

1066
02:00:56,500 --> 02:01:00,800
- Ow! You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

1067
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:06,700
Alohomora.

1068
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:21,200
Wait a minute. He's...

1069
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,600
...snoring.

1070
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:32,700
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

1071
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,300
It's got horrible breath.

1072
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:41,899
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

1073
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:43,600
Come on!

1074
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:49,700
Okay. Push.

1075
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:16,399
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

1076
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:21,700
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

1077
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:26,000
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1078
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:28,500
The harp.

1079
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:31,900
It's stopped playing.

1080
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:43,000
Jump!

1081
02:02:56,900 --> 02:03:00,800
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1082
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,299
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1083
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:22,199
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1084
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:27,500
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1085
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,100
Hermione!

1086
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:35,399
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1087
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:40,200
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1088
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,499
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1089
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:53,799
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1090
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:56,499
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1091
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:59,800
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1092
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:04,399
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1093
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:08,999
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! Devil Snare hates sunlight.

1094
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,400
Lumus Solem.

1095
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:22,000
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1096
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:27,200
Lucky we didn't panic.

1097
02:04:27,700 --> 02:04:31,400
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1098
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:34,499
What is that?

1099
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:38,500
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1100
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:54,999
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1101
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,899
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1102
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:02,600
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1103
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:10,700
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1104
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,600
Strange.

1105
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:21,300
Alohomora!

1106
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,499
Well, it was worth a try.

1107
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:29,899
What're we going to do?
There must be a thousand keys up there.

1108
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:34,099
We're looking for a big old fashioned one.
Probably rusty like the handle.

1109
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:37,800
There! I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1110
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:43,700
What's wrong, Harry?

1111
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:45,999
It's too simple.

1112
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,899
Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1113
02:05:50,900 --> 02:05:54,800
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1114
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:14,600
This complicates things a bit.

1115
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:37,800
Catch the key!

1116
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:44,200
Hurry up!

1117
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:21,199
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1118
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:24,700
Where are we? A graveyard.

1119
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:27,700
This is no graveyard.

1120
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:38,100
It's a chessboard.

1121
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:52,000
There's the door.

1122
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:05,600
Now what do we do?

1123
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:10,100
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1124
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:14,400
Alright. Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1125
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:18,899
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1126
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:23,300
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1127
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:32,200
What happens now?

1128
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:35,899
Well, white moves first.

1129
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:38,000
And then...

1130
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:41,000
...we play.

1131
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:56,599
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1132
02:08:56,600 --> 02:09:00,499
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1133
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:03,800
You there, d5.

1134
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:19,899
Yes, Hermione.

1135
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:25,300
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1136
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:33,700
Castle to e4!

1137
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,600
Pawn to c3!

1138
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,199
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1139
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:33,200
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1140
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:36,099
Then you're free to check the king.

1141
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:39,100
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1142
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:44,299
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, you can't! there must be another way!

1143
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:48,299
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1144
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:52,200
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1145
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:55,400
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1146
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:08,600
Knight to h3.

1147
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:31,500
Check.

1148
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:02,399
Ron!

1149
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:08,500
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1150
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:24,800
Checkmate.

1151
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:47,199
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1152
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:51,299
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1153
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:53,400
I have to go on.

1154
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:59,799
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1155
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:02,600
Not as good as you.

1156
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:08,200
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1157
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:15,100
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1158
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:54,800
You?

1159
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:59,399
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...

1160
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:02,599
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1161
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:05,999
Next to him, who would suspect...

1162
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:10,099
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1163
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:15,699
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1164
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:18,800
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1165
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:23,399
And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1166
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:25,799
...l would have succeeded.

1167
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:28,999
Even with Snape muttering
his little countercurse.

1168
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,399
Snape was trying to save me?

1169
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:36,999
I knew you were a danger to me right from the off.
Especially after Halloween.

1170
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:41,399
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1171
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:44,700
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1172
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:50,300
While everyone else was running about dungeon,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1173
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:54,700
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1174
02:14:55,400 --> 02:15:00,899
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1175
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:05,099
I'm never alone. Never.

1176
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:09,500
Now, what does this mirror do?

1177
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:13,200
I see what I desire.

1178
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:18,099
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1179
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:20,600
Use the boy.

1180
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:25,300
Come here, Potter! Now!

1181
02:15:37,100 --> 02:15:41,400
Tell me, what do you see?

1182
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:08,899
What is it? What do you see?

1183
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:14,199
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1184
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:16,100
He lies.

1185
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:20,199
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1186
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:24,799
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1187
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:29,100
I have strength enough for this.

1188
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,099
Harry Potter...

1189
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:52,699
...we meet again.

1190
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:54,299
Voldemort.

1191
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:58,499
Yes. You see what I've become?

1192
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:02,299
See what I must do to survive?

1193
02:17:02,300 --> 02:17:06,700
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1194
02:17:07,100 --> 02:17:10,599
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1195
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:14,499
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1196
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:18,299
But there is something that can.

1197
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:24,200
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1198
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:26,200
Stop him!

1199
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:34,000
Don't be a fool.

1200
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:37,499
Why suffer an horrific death...

1201
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:41,299
...when you can join me and live?

1202
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:42,700
Never!

1203
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:49,500
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1204
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:53,499
Tell me, Harry...

1205
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:57,599
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1206
02:17:57,600 --> 02:17:59,899
Together...

1207
02:17:59,900 --> 02:18:02,800
...we can bring them back.

1208
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:07,900
All I ask is for something in return.

1209
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:17,700
That's it, Harry.

1210
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:22,399
There is no good and evil.

1211
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:25,599
There is only power...

1212
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:30,000
...and those too weak to seek it.

1213
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:35,800
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1214
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:38,400
Just give me the Stone!

1215
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:42,099
You liar!

1216
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:44,600
Kill him!

1217
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:13,400
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1218
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:01,200
Good afternoon, Harry.

1219
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,699
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1220
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:13,899
What happened down in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret.

1221
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:19,000
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1222
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:24,899
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1223
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:27,899
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1224
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:31,199
Ron was here? ls he all right?
What about Hermione?

1225
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:36,400
Fine. They're both just fine.

1226
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:39,700
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1227
02:21:39,800 --> 02:21:42,899
The Stone has been destroyed.

1228
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:46,899
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1229
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:51,499
...and agreed it was best all around.

1230
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:55,600
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1231
02:21:57,300 --> 02:22:02,999
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1232
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:06,499
But yes, he will die.

1233
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:09,099
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1234
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:11,899
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and the next...

1235
02:22:11,900 --> 02:22:16,299
You see, only a person...

1236
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:20,399
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1237
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:25,300
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1238
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:29,699
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1239
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:35,000
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1240
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:41,599
Does that mean, with the Stone gone that is,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1241
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:44,200
I'm afraid...

1242
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:49,700
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1243
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:52,899
Harry, do you know why...

1244
02:22:52,900 --> 02:22:57,099
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1245
02:22:57,100 --> 02:23:02,000
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1246
02:23:02,300 --> 02:23:05,699
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1247
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:09,699
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1248
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:14,900
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1249
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:19,500
Love, Harry. Love.

1250
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:31,599
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1251
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:36,499
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1252
02:23:36,500 --> 02:23:39,999
And since then, I'm afraid,
I've lost my liking for them.

1253
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,599
But I think I could be safe...

1254
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:46,300
...with a nice toffee.

1255
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:51,900
Alas!

1256
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:54,700
Earwax.

1257
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:13,100
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1258
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:17,000
All right. Hermione?

1259
02:24:17,300 --> 02:24:19,500
Never better.

1260
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,700
Another year gone.

1261
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:42,899
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1262
02:24:42,900 --> 02:24:45,799
And the points stand thus:

1263
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:51,900
ln fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1264
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:59,500
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1265
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:06,499
In second place...

1266
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:11,600
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1267
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:18,999
And in first place...

1268
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:24,800
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1269
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,600
Nice one, mate.

1270
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:40,199
Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done, Slytherin.

1271
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:44,899
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1272
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:50,200
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1273
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:56,199
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1274
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:59,300
...while others were in grave peril...

1275
02:25:59,700 --> 02:26:02,300
...50 points.

1276
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:04,500
Good job.

1277
02:26:11,900 --> 02:26:18,200
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1278
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:24,000
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1279
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:30,700
And third...

1280
02:26:30,900 --> 02:26:33,999
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1281
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:38,600
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1282
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:44,100
...l award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1283
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:54,199
We're tied with Slytherin!

1284
02:26:54,200 --> 02:27:00,399
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1285
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:04,499
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1286
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:07,699
I award 10 points...

1287
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:11,200
...to Neville Longbottom.

1288
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:27,899
Assuming that my calculations
are correct I believe...

1289
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:32,700
...that a change
of decoration is in order.

1290
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:41,100
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1291
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:22,399
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1292
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:27,000
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1293
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:35,700
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1294
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:45,700
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1295
02:28:48,700 --> 02:28:50,800
This is for you.

1296
02:29:07,300 --> 02:29:09,700
Thanks, Hagrid.

1297
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:19,900
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1298
02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:24,799
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1299
02:29:24,800 --> 02:29:27,699
...you could always threaten him...

1300
02:29:27,700 --> 02:29:30,699
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with that tail of his.

1301
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:36,100
But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1302
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:40,900
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1303
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:49,499
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1304
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:51,699
I'm not going home.

1305
02:29:51,700 --> 02:29:54,000
Not really.

1306
02:30:34,882 --> 02:30:40,879
Subtitles by Your Friend, awaqeded.


1
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,134
l can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,862
l'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:23,207
-Besides, if Uncle Vernon--
-Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:26,672
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:34,180
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:40,289
l'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,259
But she's bored.

8
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:46,923
lf l could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,059
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:56,368
But l haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:56,543 --> 00:01:58,170
Not one...

12
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:00,078
...all summer.

13
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:03,477
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:08,186
l should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:11,846
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:14,152
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:16,852
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:17,297 --> 00:02:23,065
-Not now. lt's for when the Masons arrive.
-Which should be any minute.

19
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:26,536
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

20
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:28,640
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

21
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:32,505
ln the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

22
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:36,615
-Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
-l'll be waiting to open the door.

23
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,683
Excellent.

24
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:45,087
And you?

25
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:50,027
l'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that l don't exist.

26
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:51,925
Too right, you will.

27
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:55,590
With any luck, this could be the day
l make the biggest deal of my career...

28
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,296
...and you will not mess it up.

29
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,285
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

30
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,061
-Who are you?
-Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

31
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,161
Not to be rude or anything...

32
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:29,290
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

33
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:31,960
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

34
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:35,232
lt's just that Dobby
has come to tell you....

35
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:40,243
lt is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

36
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:46,215
-Why don't you sit down?
-Sit down? Sit down?

37
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,983
Dobby, l'm sorry. l didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

38
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,321
Offend Dobby?

39
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:58,828
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

40
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:04,766
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

41
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:08,333
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

42
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:10,908
No, l haven't.

43
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:13,841
That was an awful thing to say.

44
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,938
-Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
-Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

45
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:19,482
Dobby, please, stop.

46
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,618
Don't mind that. lt's just the cat.

47
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:33,089
-Bad Dobby.
-Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

48
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:35,564
Are you all right?

49
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:39,169
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

50
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:42,570
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

51
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:46,678
-Your family?
-The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

52
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:49,838
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

53
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:52,576
lf they ever knew Dobby was here....

54
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,988
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

55
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,457
Harry Potter must not go back...

56
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:07,328
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

57
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,665
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

58
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,172
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

59
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:19,511
Can't say.

60
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:25,679
-Okay, l understand. You can't say.
-Don't make me talk. l--

61
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,385
-Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
-Bad Dobby.

62
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:34,617
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole....

63
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:39,790
Give me the lamp.

64
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:43,901
Dobby, stop!

65
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:49,064
-Let me go.
-Get in there and keep quiet.

66
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:53,303
-What the devil are you doing up here?
-l was just--

67
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,209
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

68
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:58,215
Sorry.

69
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:03,847
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

70
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:07,823
-And fix that door.
-Yes, sir.

71
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:11,723
See why l've got to go back?

72
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:15,664
l don't belong here.
l belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

73
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:20,465
-lt's the only place l've got friends.
-Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

74
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,541
Well, l expect they've been....

75
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,374
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

76
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:31,909
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

77
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:36,283
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

78
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:40,119
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

79
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,727
-Give me those. Now.
-No!

80
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:01,343
Dobby, get back here.

81
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:07,816
Dobby, please, no.

82
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:12,185
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.

83
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:14,959
l can't. Hogwarts is my home.

84
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:21,225
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

85
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:26,395
lt spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.

86
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,540
One plumber said,
''Look at all that water.''

87
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,700
The second plumber said,
''Yes, and that's just the top of it.''

88
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
Mr. Mason.

89
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,920
Vernon tells me that
you're a wonderful golfer.

90
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,880
l play occasionally.

91
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,320
Mrs. Mason.

92
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
Where do you get
your beautiful suits?

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,400
All of my suits are tailor-made.

94
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,760
Dudley.

95
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,680
Wasn't there something
you wanted to say?

96
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,440
-Pudding.
-Pudding? What pudding?

97
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,240
l'm so sorry. lt's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

98
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,080
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why l kept him upstairs.

99
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,480
Well, we have ice cream.

100
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:47,444
You're never going back to that school.

101
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:52,640
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

102
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,922
Hiya, Harry.

103
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:45,469
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

104
00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:49,539
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

105
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:57,942
You better stand back.

106
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:00,510
Let's go.

107
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:07,190
-What was that?
-What was it?

108
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:11,656
Potter!

109
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,491
Dad, what's going on?

110
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:17,792
Go. Go. Go.

111
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:18,993
Dad, hurry up.

112
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,069
-Come on.
-Come on, Harry, hurry up.

113
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:26,840
Petunia, he's escaping!

114
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,570
-l've got you, Harry.
-Come here!

115
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,846
-Let go of me!
-No, boy!

116
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:36,009
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

117
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:37,814
-Get off!
-Drive!

118
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:39,854
-Right.
-Right!

119
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:41,685
No! No! No! No!

120
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:47,860
Dad!

121
00:10:57,008 --> 00:10:58,498
Damn.

122
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:06,515
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

123
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:34,641
Come on.

124
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:39,248
Okay, come on.

125
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:42,314
Okay, come on.

126
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:54,589
-Think it'd be all right if we had some?
-Yeah, Mum will never know.

127
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:14,513
lt's not much, but it's home.

128
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:16,950
l think it's brilliant.

129
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:21,488
Where have you been?

130
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:24,919
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.

131
00:12:25,096 --> 00:12:28,691
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

132
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:31,859
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

133
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:35,065
Of course, l don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

134
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,266
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

135
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:43,210
Well, you best hope l don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

136
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:45,508
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.

137
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:49,415
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

138
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:53,182
That's it. There we go.

139
00:12:53,658 --> 00:12:57,185
-Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
-Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

140
00:12:57,762 --> 00:12:59,423
Hello.

141
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:05,133
What did l do?

142
00:13:05,303 --> 00:13:09,899
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

143
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:12,668
-Morning, Weasleys.
-Morning, Dad.

144
00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:17,411
-What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
-Raids?

145
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:21,512
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

146
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:25,014
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

147
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:27,419
Well, now.

148
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:30,555
And who are you?

149
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:34,890
Sorry, sir. l'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

150
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,167
Good Lord. Are you really?

151
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:43,070
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

152
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:44,731
This morning.

153
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:50,103
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

154
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:53,717
Did you really? How did it go?

155
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:58,720
l mean-- That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

156
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:03,926
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

157
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:08,191
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

158
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,500
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

159
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:24,043
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

160
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:27,613
-Errol.
-He's always doing that.

161
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:33,212
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

162
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:36,451
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

163
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:38,562
-No.
-This lot won't come cheap.

164
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,064
-The spell books alone are very expensive.
-We'll manage.

165
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:48,067
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

166
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:50,672
Right.

167
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:52,935
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

168
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:56,103
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

169
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,304
Floo powder?

170
00:14:57,482 --> 00:15:01,748
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

171
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:04,252
ln you go.

172
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,312
That's it.

173
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,522
Diagon Alley.

174
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:21,060
You see? lt's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

175
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,035
Come on.

176
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,405
ln you go. That's it. Mind your head.

177
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:30,979
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

178
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,984
That's it, very good.

179
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:39,522
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

180
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:43,725
Diagonally.

181
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:52,601
-What did he say, dear?
-Diagonally.

182
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,828
l thought he did.

183
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,010
Don't touch anything, Draco.

184
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,450
Yes, Father.

185
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,610
Mr. Malfoy,
what a pleasure to see you again.

186
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,930
And young Master Malfoy too. Delighted.

187
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,210
l must show you, just in today,
and very reasonably priced--

188
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,690
-l'm not buying today, Borgin. l'm selling.
-Selling?

189
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,450
Draco.

190
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,210
You're aware, no doubt,
that the Ministry of Magic...

191
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,450
...is conducting more raids
on private houses.

192
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,770
There's even rumors
of a new Muggle Protection Act.

193
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,530
Pure wizard blood is counting for less
everywhere, l'm afraid.

194
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,610
Not with me.

195
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:12,130
Anyway, l brought a few items
from home that might prove...

196
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:17,450
...embarrassing were the Ministry to call.
Poisons and the like.

197
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,130
Look at this.

198
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:29,050
That particular item is not for sale.

199
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,330
l understand. lt has unique qualities.

200
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,690
One wouldn't want to see it
falling into the wrong hands.

201
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,610
You can keep the box.

202
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,050
What did l say?

203
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,850
-Touch nothing.
-Exactly.

204
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,370
Sorry, Father.

205
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,890
Come on. We're going.

206
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,650
lt's a pleasure to do business with you,
Mr. Malfoy.

207
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,130
Always a pleasure.

208
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:38,181
-Looking for something?
-No, l....

209
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:40,061
l'm just in the wrong place.

210
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:42,021
Sorry.

211
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,221
Thank you.

212
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:06,064
-Not lost, are you, my dear?
-l'm fine, thank you. l was just going....

213
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:10,728
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

214
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:13,605
-No. Please--
-Harry?

215
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:14,833
Hagrid!

216
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,036
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

217
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:29,086
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

218
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:33,250
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

219
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:35,658
l was lost, l--

220
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:38,800
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

221
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:44,098
Me? l was.... l was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

222
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:47,173
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

223
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,231
Harry. Hagrid.

224
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,838
Hello, Hermione.

225
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:59,869
-lt's so good to see you.
-lt's great to see you too.

226
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,105
What did you do to your glasses?

227
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,147
Oculus Reparo.

228
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,350
l definitely need to remember that one.

229
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:16,254
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. l'll leave you to it.

230
00:21:16,427 --> 00:21:17,894
-Okay, bye.
-Thank you. Bye.

231
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:20,027
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

232
00:21:30,774 --> 00:21:31,866
Harry.

233
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,273
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

234
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:38,279
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

235
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:40,713
Here he is.

236
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:46,349
Mum fancies him.

237
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:49,788
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

238
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,396
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.

239
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:00,468
lt can't be. Harry Potter?

240
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:03,871
Harry Potter!

241
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,235
Excuse me, madam.

242
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:11,112
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and l rate the front page.

243
00:22:11,282 --> 00:22:14,445
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

244
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:18,015
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

245
00:22:18,188 --> 00:22:22,284
...to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...

246
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:28,663
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

247
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:33,667
...its 27th week atop
the Daily Prophet bestseller list...

248
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:38,331
...he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

249
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:44,413
...with my entire collected works...

250
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:47,210
...free of charge.

251
00:22:49,386 --> 00:22:51,616
Now, ladies?

252
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:55,017
Harry, now you give me those,
and l'll get them signed.

253
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:58,684
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

254
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:10,496
l'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

255
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:15,168
Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into
a bookshop without making the front page.

256
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:17,508
Leave him alone.

257
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:21,173
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

258
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:25,379
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

259
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,017
Mr. Potter.

260
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,419
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

261
00:23:33,597 --> 00:23:35,792
Forgive me.

262
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,226
Your scar is legend.

263
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,034
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

264
00:23:42,373 --> 00:23:44,500
Voldemort killed my parents.

265
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,068
He was nothing more than a murderer.

266
00:23:51,115 --> 00:23:54,050
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

267
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:56,015
Or very foolish.

268
00:23:56,453 --> 00:23:59,980
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

269
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:04,857
And you must be Miss Granger.

270
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:11,997
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

271
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,098
Muggles, aren't they?

272
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:28,143
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

273
00:24:29,586 --> 00:24:32,885
...tatty, secondhand book.

274
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:36,454
You must be the Weasleys.

275
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,919
lt's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

276
00:24:39,096 --> 00:24:42,793
-Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
-Lucius.

277
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:47,630
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

278
00:24:47,805 --> 00:24:50,137
l do hope they're paying you overtime...

279
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:53,470
...but judging by the state of this,
l'd say not.

280
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,010
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

281
00:24:59,183 --> 00:25:01,242
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

282
00:25:01,552 --> 00:25:06,546
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

283
00:25:06,824 --> 00:25:08,621
Clearly.

284
00:25:10,694 --> 00:25:14,391
Associating with Muggles.

285
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:23,198
And l thought your family
could sink no lower.

286
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,308
l'll see you at work.

287
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,816
See you at school.

288
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:46,323
-1 0:58. Come on.
-The train will be leaving any moment.

289
00:25:46,497 --> 00:25:49,762
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

290
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:56,999
Okay.

291
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:04,775
After you, dear.

292
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,181
Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

293
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:13,548
Let's go.

294
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:30,634
-What do you two think you're doing?
-Sorry.

295
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:34,066
Lost control of the trolley.

296
00:26:35,412 --> 00:26:37,744
-Why can't we get through?
-l don't know.

297
00:26:37,915 --> 00:26:41,282
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

298
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:46,589
The train leaves at exactly 1 1 :00.
We've missed it.

299
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:50,124
Harry, if we can't get through...

300
00:26:50,427 --> 00:26:53,089
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

301
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:57,500
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

302
00:26:58,569 --> 00:26:59,900
The car.

303
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:09,142
There we go.

304
00:27:09,302 --> 00:27:12,942
Now, all we need to do
is find the Hogwarts Express.

305
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:15,542
Ron, are you sure you know
how to fly this?

306
00:27:15,782 --> 00:27:17,382
No problem.

307
00:27:23,982 --> 00:27:25,702
Look out!

308
00:27:31,256 --> 00:27:33,417
Ron, l should tell you...

309
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:37,357
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

310
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:38,621
Right.

311
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:39,952
Okay.

312
00:27:57,248 --> 00:28:00,547
Oh, no! The lnvisibility Booster
must be faulty.

313
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:04,147
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

314
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:05,584
Okay.

315
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:18,559
All we need to do is catch up
with the train.

316
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:20,397
We can't be far behind.

317
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:25,137
-Do you hear that?
-We must be getting close.

318
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,671
Hold on.

319
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:56,132
Harry!

320
00:28:58,776 --> 00:29:00,607
Hold on!

321
00:29:03,948 --> 00:29:06,439
Take my hand!

322
00:29:10,722 --> 00:29:11,950
Hold on!

323
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:15,718
l'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

324
00:29:28,306 --> 00:29:31,605
-l think we found the train.
-Yeah.

325
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:49,521
Welcome home.

326
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:06,905
Up! Up!

327
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:10,006
lt's not working!

328
00:30:13,952 --> 00:30:16,512
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

329
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,918
Stop! Stop! Stop!

330
00:30:45,016 --> 00:30:49,646
-My wand. Look at my wand.
-Be thankful it's not your neck.

331
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:54,258
-What's happening?
-l don't know.

332
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,854
Come on, go! Fast!

333
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:09,028
Scabbers, you're okay.

334
00:32:10,003 --> 00:32:12,028
The car!

335
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,318
Dad's gonna kill me.

336
00:32:37,897 --> 00:32:40,229
See you, Hedwig.

337
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:43,900
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

338
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,039
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 9 3/4...

339
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:50,438
...we almost get killed by a tree....

340
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:54,137
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

341
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,685
Well, take a good look, lads.

342
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:04,789
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

343
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:11,086
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

344
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:17,564
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

345
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:20,768
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

346
00:33:21,474 --> 00:33:25,308
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

347
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:28,914
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

348
00:33:29,082 --> 00:33:32,210
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

349
00:33:32,685 --> 00:33:36,246
Honestly, Professor Snape,
l think it did more damage to us.

350
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:37,582
Silence.

351
00:33:39,592 --> 00:33:45,963
l assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

352
00:33:46,132 --> 00:33:49,898
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

353
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,334
-As it is--
-They are not.

354
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:59,602
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

355
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:01,469
Headmaster...

356
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:06,449
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

357
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:10,521
-As such--
-l am well aware of our bylaws, Severus...

358
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,557
...having written
quite a few of them myself.

359
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:17,157
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

360
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:22,324
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

361
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:24,963
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

362
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:27,572
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

363
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,935
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

364
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:34,639
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

365
00:34:34,814 --> 00:34:39,808
...but l must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

366
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:44,983
l will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

367
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:13,244
Mr. Filch, you dropped this.

368
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:50,636
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning, Professor Sprout.

369
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:55,114
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

370
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:58,083
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

371
00:35:58,255 --> 00:36:02,248
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

372
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,291
Yes, Miss Granger?

373
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:06,759
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

374
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,958
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

375
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:17,129
lt's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

376
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:20,140
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

377
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,972
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

378
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:25,046
...their cries won't kill you yet.

379
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:29,015
But they could knock you out for several hours,
which is why l have given you earmuffs...

380
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,676
...for auditory protection.

381
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:35,291
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

382
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,257
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

383
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:41,420
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

384
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:44,590
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

385
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:50,772
Got it? And...

386
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:53,101
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

387
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:57,975
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

388
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:04,815
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

389
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:09,282
-No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
-Yes, well, just leave him there.

390
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:13,220
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

391
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,958
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

392
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:35,681
-There's Nearly Headless Nick.
-Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

393
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:38,412
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

394
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,165
Say it. l'm doomed.

395
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,738
-You're doomed.
-Hi, Harry.

396
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,705
l'm Colin Creevey. l'm in Gryffindor too.

397
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:04,093
-Hi, Colin, nice to meet you.
-Say, do you think your friend here...

398
00:38:04,293 --> 00:38:06,613
...could take a photo
of me and you standing together?

399
00:38:06,853 --> 00:38:09,373
You know, to prove l've met you.
lt's for my dad.

400
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:13,093
He's a milkman, you know. A Muggle,
like all our family's been until me.

401
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,973
No one knew all the stuff l could do was
magic till we got our Hogwarts letter.

402
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,973
Everyone just thought l was mental.

403
00:38:19,613 --> 00:38:21,413
lmagine that.

404
00:38:22,263 --> 00:38:24,094
Ron, is that your owl?

405
00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:41,508
Bloody bird's a menace.

406
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,210
Oh, no.

407
00:38:47,388 --> 00:38:50,846
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

408
00:38:52,774 --> 00:38:58,007
Go on, Ron. l ignored one
from my gran once. lt was horrible.

409
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:07,052
Ronald Weasley!

410
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:15,755
How dare you steal that car!
l am absolutely disgusted!

411
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:18,658
Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...

412
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:21,200
...and it's entirely your fault!

413
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,538
lf you put another toe out of line...

414
00:39:25,707 --> 00:39:28,972
...we'll bring you straight home!

415
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:32,737
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.

416
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:36,646
Your father and l are so proud.

417
00:39:54,904 --> 00:40:01,332
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

418
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,034
Me.

419
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:05,737
Gilderoy Lockhart...

420
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:09,214
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

421
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:12,718
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

422
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:15,789
...and five times winner...

423
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:22,030
...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

424
00:40:22,398 --> 00:40:23,888
But l don't talk about that.

425
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:28,594
l didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

426
00:40:32,741 --> 00:40:35,781
l see you've all bought a complete
set of my books. Well done.

427
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:41,341
Now, l thought we'd start today
with a little quiz.

428
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:45,301
Nothing to worry about.

429
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:49,061
Just to check how well
you've read them.

430
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:50,781
Thank you.

431
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:55,301
How much you've taken in.

432
00:41:00,261 --> 00:41:03,901
Look at these questions.
They're all about him.

433
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,221
''What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
favorite color?''

434
00:41:07,941 --> 00:41:12,381
''What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
greatest achievement to date?''

435
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:18,141
You have 30 minutes. Start...

436
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:23,021
...now.

437
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:35,341
Hardly any of you remembered
that my favorite color is lilac.

438
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,461
But Miss Hermione Granger knew...

439
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,541
...that my secret ambition
is to rid the world of evil...

440
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:47,341
...and market my own range
of hair-care potions. Good girl.

441
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:51,372
Now, be warned.

442
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:53,700
lt is my job to arm you...

443
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:59,179
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

444
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,611
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

445
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:07,814
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst l am here.

446
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:10,926
l must ask you not to scream.

447
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:13,654
lt might provoke them.

448
00:42:16,989 --> 00:42:18,513
Cornish pixies?

449
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,716
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

450
00:42:22,527 --> 00:42:24,654
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

451
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,994
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

452
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:32,068
Let's see what you make of them.

453
00:42:36,408 --> 00:42:39,673
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

454
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,556
-You just stay there!
-Please, get me down!

455
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,368
-Get off me!
-Stop. Hold still!

456
00:43:06,004 --> 00:43:09,201
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!

457
00:43:29,194 --> 00:43:33,460
l'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

458
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:37,394
What do we do now?

459
00:43:38,904 --> 00:43:40,394
lmmobulus!

460
00:43:49,915 --> 00:43:52,179
Why is it always me?

461
00:43:58,523 --> 00:44:01,219
l spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

462
00:44:01,393 --> 00:44:05,056
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

463
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:08,529
What--? l don't believe it.

464
00:44:11,303 --> 00:44:13,999
-Where you think you're going, Flint?
-Quidditch practice.

465
00:44:14,172 --> 00:44:18,575
-l booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
-Easy, Wood. l've got a note.

466
00:44:19,978 --> 00:44:22,173
l smell trouble.

467
00:44:22,781 --> 00:44:26,308
''l, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

468
00:44:26,485 --> 00:44:29,977
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker.''

469
00:44:30,155 --> 00:44:32,817
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

470
00:44:36,795 --> 00:44:39,423
-Malfoy?
-That's right.

471
00:44:39,598 --> 00:44:42,362
And that's not all
that's new this year.

472
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:46,637
Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?

473
00:44:46,805 --> 00:44:48,898
A gift from Draco's father.

474
00:44:49,074 --> 00:44:52,805
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

475
00:44:52,978 --> 00:44:55,970
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

476
00:44:56,148 --> 00:44:59,083
They got in on pure talent.

477
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:06,155
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

478
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:12,118
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

479
00:45:19,671 --> 00:45:21,536
You okay, Ron?

480
00:45:24,543 --> 00:45:26,340
Say something.

481
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:37,112
-Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
-No, Colin, get out of the way.

482
00:45:38,023 --> 00:45:40,048
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

483
00:45:40,225 --> 00:45:42,352
He'll know what to do.

484
00:45:51,236 --> 00:45:54,603
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

485
00:45:58,376 --> 00:46:01,971
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
l'm afraid.

486
00:46:02,614 --> 00:46:05,811
-Okay.
-Better out than in.

487
00:46:06,384 --> 00:46:11,720
-Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
-Malfoy. He called Hermione....

488
00:46:12,924 --> 00:46:16,360
Well, l don't know
exactly what it means.

489
00:46:20,332 --> 00:46:22,527
He called me a Mudblood.

490
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:25,363
-He did not.
-What's a Mudblood?

491
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:30,265
lt means ''dirty blood.'' Mudblood's a really
foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.

492
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:34,708
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

493
00:46:35,213 --> 00:46:39,343
lt's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

494
00:46:40,485 --> 00:46:45,286
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

495
00:46:45,457 --> 00:46:50,121
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

496
00:46:50,295 --> 00:46:51,922
That's horrible.

497
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:56,264
lt's disgusting.

498
00:46:56,434 --> 00:46:59,926
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

499
00:47:00,105 --> 00:47:03,472
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

500
00:47:03,642 --> 00:47:08,204
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

501
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,575
Come here.

502
00:47:11,683 --> 00:47:18,145
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

503
00:47:25,931 --> 00:47:28,957
Harry, Harry, Harry.

504
00:47:29,134 --> 00:47:31,364
Can you possibly imagine...

505
00:47:31,536 --> 00:47:34,767
...a better way to serve detention...

506
00:47:35,407 --> 00:47:38,103
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

507
00:47:38,276 --> 00:47:39,675
Not really.

508
00:47:39,844 --> 00:47:46,215
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

509
00:47:46,384 --> 00:47:48,318
Remember that.

510
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:54,251
Come.

511
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:56,519
Come...

512
00:47:57,796 --> 00:48:00,663
...to me.

513
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:06,294
-What?
-Sorry?

514
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,508
That voice.

515
00:48:10,675 --> 00:48:12,199
Voice?

516
00:48:15,781 --> 00:48:20,411
-Didn't you hear it?
-What are you talking about, Harry?

517
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:24,614
l think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

518
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:28,851
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

519
00:48:29,161 --> 00:48:32,528
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

520
00:48:37,502 --> 00:48:40,027
Spooky.

521
00:48:43,074 --> 00:48:45,201
Blood.

522
00:48:45,377 --> 00:48:48,904
l smell blood.

523
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,174
Let me rip you.

524
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,945
Let me kill you.

525
00:48:57,756 --> 00:48:59,223
Kill!

526
00:49:00,158 --> 00:49:01,489
Kill!

527
00:49:02,194 --> 00:49:04,128
-Kill!
-Harry!

528
00:49:04,296 --> 00:49:06,764
-Did you hear it?
-Hear what?

529
00:49:06,932 --> 00:49:10,368
-That voice.
-Voice? What voice?

530
00:49:10,535 --> 00:49:14,494
l heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just--

531
00:49:14,773 --> 00:49:16,866
lt's time.

532
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:20,239
lt's moving.
l think it's going to kill.

533
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:25,172
-Kill?
-Harry, wait! Not so fast!

534
00:49:50,742 --> 00:49:52,801
Strange.

535
00:49:53,345 --> 00:49:57,839
-l've never seen spiders act like that.
-l don't like spiders.

536
00:50:01,953 --> 00:50:04,012
What's that?

537
00:50:07,459 --> 00:50:11,987
''The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware.''

538
00:50:12,163 --> 00:50:14,427
lt's written in blood.

539
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:19,530
Oh, no.

540
00:50:24,242 --> 00:50:26,506
lt's Filch's cat.

541
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:29,309
lt's Mrs. Norris.

542
00:50:45,397 --> 00:50:48,093
''Enemies of the Heir, beware.''

543
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:51,967
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

544
00:50:52,137 --> 00:50:57,302
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

545
00:50:58,777 --> 00:51:00,608
Potter?

546
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:02,906
What are you...?

547
00:51:06,217 --> 00:51:08,515
Mrs. Norris?

548
00:51:10,021 --> 00:51:14,185
-You've murdered my cat.
-No. No.

549
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:15,855
l'll kill you.

550
00:51:18,196 --> 00:51:21,029
-l'll kill you!
-Argus!

551
00:51:22,434 --> 00:51:24,561
Argus, l....

552
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:31,201
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

553
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:33,911
Everyone except...

554
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:36,908
...you three.

555
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,814
Ravenclaws, follow me.

556
00:51:43,688 --> 00:51:47,556
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

557
00:51:47,726 --> 00:51:50,559
Thought so.
So unlucky l wasn't there.

558
00:51:50,729 --> 00:51:53,926
l know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

559
00:51:56,267 --> 00:51:58,895
But how she has been Petrified,
l cannot say.

560
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,866
Ask him.
lt's him that's done it.

561
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,736
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

562
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:09,005
lt's not true, sir. l swear.
l never touched Mrs. Norris.

563
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:13,617
-Rubbish.
-lf l might, headmaster?

564
00:52:14,085 --> 00:52:18,886
Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

565
00:52:19,391 --> 00:52:21,291
However...

566
00:52:21,626 --> 00:52:24,595
...the circumstances are suspicious.

567
00:52:24,763 --> 00:52:29,393
l, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

568
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,831
l'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

569
00:52:32,003 --> 00:52:35,404
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

570
00:52:35,573 --> 00:52:38,872
That's why Ron and l
went looking for him, professor.

571
00:52:39,044 --> 00:52:41,774
We'd just found him when he said....

572
00:52:44,049 --> 00:52:47,883
-Yes, Miss Granger?
-When l said l wasn't hungry.

573
00:52:49,254 --> 00:52:53,247
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

574
00:52:55,593 --> 00:53:01,122
-lnnocent until proven guilty, Severus.
-My cat has been Petrified.

575
00:53:01,966 --> 00:53:07,802
-l want to see some punishment!
-We will be able to cure her, Argus.

576
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:13,507
As l understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

577
00:53:13,678 --> 00:53:18,115
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

578
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,145
And in the meantime...

579
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,712
...l strongly recommend caution...

580
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,358
...to all.

581
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:41,839
-lt's a bit strange, isn't it?
-Strange?

582
00:53:42,006 --> 00:53:44,770
You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

583
00:53:44,943 --> 00:53:49,642
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. lt's just strange.

584
00:53:49,814 --> 00:53:53,045
Do you think l should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, l mean?

585
00:53:53,218 --> 00:53:54,685
Are you mad?

586
00:53:54,853 --> 00:54:00,348
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

587
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,826
She's right, you know.

588
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:11,499
Could l have your attention,
please?

589
00:54:12,036 --> 00:54:17,531
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

590
00:54:17,709 --> 00:54:20,075
...into water goblets.

591
00:54:21,012 --> 00:54:22,673
Like so.

592
00:54:22,847 --> 00:54:27,750
One, two, three.
Vera Verto.

593
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:35,224
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

594
00:54:35,827 --> 00:54:40,787
Mr. Weasley.
''One, two, three. Vera Verto.''

595
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:46,462
Vera Verto!

596
00:54:52,577 --> 00:54:55,239
That wand needs replacing,
Mr. Weasley.

597
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:58,742
-Yes, Miss Granger?
-Professor...

598
00:54:58,917 --> 00:55:03,115
...l was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

599
00:55:09,294 --> 00:55:10,556
Very well.

600
00:55:12,063 --> 00:55:14,054
You all know, of course...

601
00:55:14,232 --> 00:55:18,100
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

602
00:55:18,269 --> 00:55:22,706
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

603
00:55:22,874 --> 00:55:26,605
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

604
00:55:26,778 --> 00:55:32,410
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

605
00:55:33,084 --> 00:55:39,080
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

606
00:55:39,257 --> 00:55:42,283
-One did not.
-Three guesses who.

607
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:45,461
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

608
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:48,793
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

609
00:55:48,967 --> 00:55:53,563
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

610
00:55:53,738 --> 00:55:55,831
ln other words, pure-bloods.

611
00:55:56,241 --> 00:56:01,577
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

612
00:56:02,413 --> 00:56:04,643
Now, according to legend...

613
00:56:04,816 --> 00:56:08,547
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

614
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,349
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

615
00:56:12,523 --> 00:56:16,960
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

616
00:56:17,128 --> 00:56:21,258
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

617
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:23,798
The Heir alone...

618
00:56:23,968 --> 00:56:26,630
...would be able to open the Chamber...

619
00:56:26,804 --> 00:56:31,571
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

620
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:35,110
...purge the school
of all those who...

621
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,274
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

622
00:56:40,885 --> 00:56:43,012
Muggle-borns.

623
00:56:44,088 --> 00:56:47,683
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

624
00:56:47,859 --> 00:56:51,317
No such chamber has been found.

625
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:56,560
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

626
00:56:57,402 --> 00:56:59,996
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

627
00:57:00,171 --> 00:57:03,732
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

628
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:08,004
lt is said to be the home...

629
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:09,806
...of a monster.

630
00:57:15,553 --> 00:57:19,216
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

631
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:23,588
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

632
00:57:23,761 --> 00:57:27,629
lf there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it really has been opened, that means--

633
00:57:27,799 --> 00:57:31,735
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

634
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:36,272
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

635
00:57:36,441 --> 00:57:39,103
-lf you're talking about Malfoy--
-Of course. You heard him.

636
00:57:39,277 --> 00:57:41,006
''You'll be next, Mudbloods.''

637
00:57:41,179 --> 00:57:43,773
l heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

638
00:57:43,948 --> 00:57:47,111
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
l mean, look at his family.

639
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:50,083
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

640
00:57:50,254 --> 00:57:53,690
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

641
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:58,289
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

642
00:57:58,463 --> 00:58:00,328
Mind you, it would be difficult.

643
00:58:00,498 --> 00:58:03,524
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

644
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:08,161
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

645
00:58:14,979 --> 00:58:17,447
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.

646
00:58:17,615 --> 00:58:20,345
''Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

647
00:58:20,518 --> 00:58:24,750
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another.''

648
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:28,722
You mean if Harry and l drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

649
00:58:28,893 --> 00:58:32,260
-Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
-Exactly.

650
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:36,298
But it's tricky. l've never seen
a more complicated potion.

651
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:39,561
-How long will it take to make?
-A month.

652
00:58:39,937 --> 00:58:41,404
A month?

653
00:58:41,572 --> 00:58:45,406
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

654
00:58:45,576 --> 00:58:48,773
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

655
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:50,846
l know.

656
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:53,848
But it's the only plan we've got.

657
00:59:43,534 --> 00:59:46,230
Another goal for Slytherin!

658
00:59:47,572 --> 00:59:50,973
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

659
00:59:52,143 --> 00:59:53,701
Yeah!

660
00:59:53,978 --> 00:59:55,741
Yeah!

661
01:00:20,004 --> 01:00:22,336
All right there, Scarhead?

662
01:00:28,446 --> 01:00:30,937
Watch yourself, Harry!

663
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:33,112
Wood, look out!

664
01:00:46,797 --> 01:00:49,630
Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.

665
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,563
That's been tampered with, that has.

666
01:00:52,603 --> 01:00:53,592
l'll stop it.

667
01:00:53,771 --> 01:00:58,401
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

668
01:01:43,217 --> 01:01:45,811
Training for the ballet, Potter?

669
01:02:16,784 --> 01:02:19,014
You'll never catch me, Potter.

670
01:03:49,811 --> 01:03:50,869
Let's go.

671
01:03:51,045 --> 01:03:56,278
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
Gryffindor wins!

672
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,615
Finite lncantatem!

673
01:04:11,699 --> 01:04:13,030
-Thank you.
-Are you okay?

674
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:15,294
No. l think my arm is broken.

675
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:19,270
Not to worry, Harry. l will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

676
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,375
-Not you.
-Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

677
01:04:22,543 --> 01:04:26,070
This won't hurt a bit.

678
01:04:32,186 --> 01:04:35,178
Brackium Emendo!

679
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:46,325
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...

680
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:48,731
...but the point is...

681
01:04:50,138 --> 01:04:54,234
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

682
01:04:54,408 --> 01:04:57,070
Broken? There's no bones left.

683
01:04:58,779 --> 01:05:00,747
Much more flexible, though.

684
01:05:03,217 --> 01:05:07,153
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

685
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:09,255
Should have been brought
straight to me.

686
01:05:09,423 --> 01:05:11,948
l can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back....

687
01:05:12,126 --> 01:05:13,616
You will be able to, won't you?

688
01:05:13,794 --> 01:05:16,922
l'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

689
01:05:17,565 --> 01:05:22,229
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

690
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:28,131
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

691
01:05:34,782 --> 01:05:36,545
Kill.

692
01:05:37,385 --> 01:05:38,909
Kill.

693
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:47,523
Time to kill.

694
01:05:53,668 --> 01:05:54,657
Hello.

695
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:57,494
Dobby?

696
01:05:57,672 --> 01:06:00,004
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

697
01:06:00,474 --> 01:06:04,205
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

698
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:08,974
lt was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

699
01:06:09,283 --> 01:06:12,252
lndeed. Yes, sir.

700
01:06:13,254 --> 01:06:18,282
-You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
-At least you would be away from here.

701
01:06:18,459 --> 01:06:21,121
Harry Potter must go home.

702
01:06:21,295 --> 01:06:24,890
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see--

703
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:28,433
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

704
01:06:28,603 --> 01:06:32,164
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

705
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:35,969
Dobby had to iron his hands.

706
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:42,775
You better clear off before my bones
come back, Dobby, or l might strangle you.

707
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:50,618
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.
Dobby gets them five times a day at home.

708
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:53,555
l don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

709
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:57,729
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

710
01:06:57,898 --> 01:07:01,265
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

711
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:04,529
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

712
01:07:04,705 --> 01:07:08,402
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

713
01:07:08,576 --> 01:07:14,014
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

714
01:07:23,357 --> 01:07:25,985
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

715
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:31,291
This, sir? lt is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.

716
01:07:31,465 --> 01:07:36,562
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

717
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:40,071
Listen.

718
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:41,765
Listen!

719
01:07:41,942 --> 01:07:45,673
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

720
01:07:46,314 --> 01:07:48,748
Harry Potter must not stay here...

721
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:53,444
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

722
01:07:53,621 --> 01:07:57,079
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

723
01:07:57,258 --> 01:07:59,249
l shouldn't have said that.

724
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:06,125
-Bad Dobby! Bad!
-Stop it!

725
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,995
Stop it, Dobby!

726
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:13,470
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

727
01:08:13,441 --> 01:08:18,674
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

728
01:08:18,846 --> 01:08:21,747
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

729
01:08:33,594 --> 01:08:34,686
Put him here.

730
01:08:39,267 --> 01:08:42,202
-What happened?
-There's been another attack.

731
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:48,172
l think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.

732
01:08:48,943 --> 01:08:53,642
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

733
01:09:01,756 --> 01:09:04,520
What can this mean, Albus?

734
01:09:04,692 --> 01:09:06,626
lt means...

735
01:09:06,994 --> 01:09:09,758
...that our students
are in great danger.

736
01:09:09,931 --> 01:09:13,332
-What should l tell the staff?
-The truth.

737
01:09:13,601 --> 01:09:17,401
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

738
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:20,673
lt is as we feared, Minerva.

739
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:25,470
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

740
01:09:28,316 --> 01:09:32,446
Again? You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

741
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:35,350
Of course.
Don't you see?

742
01:09:35,523 --> 01:09:38,549
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

743
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,754
-Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
-Maybe.

744
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:45,092
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

745
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:49,202
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

746
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:53,329
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

747
01:09:54,242 --> 01:09:56,904
No. No one ever comes in here.

748
01:09:57,745 --> 01:10:00,270
-Why?
-Moaning Myrtle.

749
01:10:00,448 --> 01:10:02,416
Who?

750
01:10:02,917 --> 01:10:04,646
Moaning Myrtle.

751
01:10:04,819 --> 01:10:08,220
-Who's Moaning Myrtle?
-l'm Moaning Myrtle.

752
01:10:14,161 --> 01:10:16,527
l wouldn't expect you to know me.

753
01:10:16,697 --> 01:10:19,723
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...

754
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:23,301
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

755
01:10:30,511 --> 01:10:32,638
She's a little sensitive.

756
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:39,085
Gather round!

757
01:10:39,453 --> 01:10:44,413
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

758
01:10:44,592 --> 01:10:47,720
Can you all hear me?

759
01:10:48,396 --> 01:10:49,727
Excellent.

760
01:10:50,231 --> 01:10:53,928
ln light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

761
01:10:54,101 --> 01:10:58,800
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

762
01:10:58,973 --> 01:11:03,603
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

763
01:11:03,778 --> 01:11:06,338
...as l myself have done
on countless occasions.

764
01:11:06,514 --> 01:11:10,177
For full details,
see my published works.

765
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:18,410
That Lockhart's something, isn't he?
Awfully brave chap.

766
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,770
-Justin Finch-Fletchley. Hufflepuff.
-Nice to meet you. l'm--

767
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:25,330
l know who you are. We all do.
Even us Muggle-borns.

768
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:28,517
Let me introduce my assistant...

769
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:31,070
...Professor Snape.

770
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:37,179
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

771
01:11:37,351 --> 01:11:39,376
l don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

772
01:11:39,553 --> 01:11:44,513
You'll still have your Potions master
when l'm through with him. Never fear.

773
01:12:00,174 --> 01:12:01,163
One.

774
01:12:02,009 --> 01:12:02,998
Two.

775
01:12:03,811 --> 01:12:06,837
-Three!
-Expelliarmus!

776
01:12:15,422 --> 01:12:18,084
-Do you think he's all right?
-Who cares?

777
01:12:18,258 --> 01:12:21,227
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

778
01:12:21,395 --> 01:12:25,957
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was
pretty obvious what you were about to do.

779
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:29,364
lf l had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.

780
01:12:29,536 --> 01:12:32,994
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

781
01:12:33,173 --> 01:12:37,667
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.

782
01:12:39,413 --> 01:12:41,847
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

783
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:47,349
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

784
01:12:47,521 --> 01:12:51,013
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.

785
01:12:51,425 --> 01:12:55,156
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

786
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:59,390
Might l suggest someone
from my own house?

787
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,136
Malfoy, perhaps?

788
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:13,146
-Good luck, Potter.
-Thank you, sir.

789
01:13:21,121 --> 01:13:23,112
Wands at the ready.

790
01:13:23,724 --> 01:13:26,716
-Scared, Potter?
-You wish.

791
01:13:37,137 --> 01:13:38,866
On the count of three...

792
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:43,373
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

793
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:47,071
We don't want any accidents here.
One.

794
01:13:48,849 --> 01:13:51,409
-Two.
-Everte Statum!

795
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:05,293
Rictusempra!

796
01:14:16,276 --> 01:14:18,073
l said disarm only.

797
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:20,213
Serpensortia!

798
01:14:28,889 --> 01:14:31,687
Don't move, Potter.
l'll get rid of it for you.

799
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:37,297
Allow me, Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!

800
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,502
Vipera Evanesca.

801
01:15:29,216 --> 01:15:31,582
What are you playing at?

802
01:15:44,364 --> 01:15:47,060
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

803
01:15:47,234 --> 01:15:49,498
-l'm a what?
-You can talk to snakes.

804
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:54,972
l know. l accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

805
01:15:55,142 --> 01:15:59,101
Once. But so what?
l bet loads of people here can do it.

806
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:03,045
No, they can't.
lt's not a very common gift, Harry.

807
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:05,245
This is bad.

808
01:16:05,419 --> 01:16:09,150
What's bad? lf l hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin--

809
01:16:09,323 --> 01:16:12,815
-That's what you said to it.
-You were there. You heard me.

810
01:16:12,993 --> 01:16:16,895
l heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

811
01:16:17,064 --> 01:16:19,931
l spoke a different language?

812
01:16:21,001 --> 01:16:23,401
But l didn't realize--

813
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:26,334
How can l speak a language
without knowing l can?

814
01:16:26,506 --> 01:16:30,533
l don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

815
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,406
Harry, listen to me.

816
01:16:32,813 --> 01:16:35,680
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

817
01:16:35,849 --> 01:16:40,377
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

818
01:16:40,621 --> 01:16:41,645
Exactly.

819
01:16:41,822 --> 01:16:45,189
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

820
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:47,350
But l'm not.

821
01:16:50,097 --> 01:16:52,031
l can't be.

822
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:55,191
He lived a thousand years ago.

823
01:16:55,369 --> 01:16:58,600
For all we know, you could be.

824
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:15,060
Who am l, Hedwig?

825
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,820
What am l?

826
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,868
l'll see you back in the common room.

827
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:13,830
So anyway, l told Justin to hide up
in our dormitory.

828
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:18,190
l mean to say, if Potter's
marked him down as his next victim...

829
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:21,150
...it's best he keeps
a low profile for a while.

830
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:23,950
But why would he want to attack Justin?

831
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:29,030
Well, Justin let it slip to Potter
that he was Muggle-born.

832
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:32,870
And you definitely think Potter's
the Heir of Slytherin?

833
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:36,390
Hannah, he's a Parselmouth.

834
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:39,350
Everyone knows that's the mark
of a Dark wizard.

835
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:43,630
Have you ever heard of a decent one
who could talk to snakes?

836
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:46,910
They called Slytherin himself
Serpent-tongue.

837
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:49,670
Harry always seems so nice, though.

838
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:54,430
And, after all, he is the one
who made You-Know-Who disappear.

839
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:58,910
That's probably why You-Know-Who
wanted to kill him in the first place.

840
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:02,390
Didn't want another Dark Lord
competing with him.

841
01:20:00,345 --> 01:20:04,611
l want blood.

842
01:20:07,519 --> 01:20:12,513
They all must die.

843
01:20:13,091 --> 01:20:15,082
Kill.

844
01:20:15,761 --> 01:20:17,854
Kill.

845
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:20,928
Kill.

846
01:20:21,266 --> 01:20:26,927
Time to kill.

847
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,630
Caught in the act.

848
01:21:03,799 --> 01:21:05,767
l'll have you out this time, Potter.

849
01:21:06,268 --> 01:21:08,759
Mark my words.

850
01:21:08,937 --> 01:21:13,169
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand--

851
01:21:39,935 --> 01:21:41,869
Professor...

852
01:21:42,037 --> 01:21:43,402
...l swear l didn't.

853
01:21:43,572 --> 01:21:46,803
This is out of my hands, Potter.

854
01:21:56,451 --> 01:21:59,113
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

855
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:10,623
Sherbet Lemon.

856
01:22:44,566 --> 01:22:46,693
Professor Dumbledore?

857
01:23:03,185 --> 01:23:05,881
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

858
01:23:08,757 --> 01:23:13,285
l was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

859
01:23:13,461 --> 01:23:18,922
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

860
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:22,627
But l stand by what l said last year.

861
01:23:22,804 --> 01:23:26,205
You would have done well in Slytherin.

862
01:23:26,374 --> 01:23:27,705
You're wrong.

863
01:23:56,972 --> 01:23:58,405
Harry?

864
01:23:58,773 --> 01:24:01,003
Professor.

865
01:24:01,176 --> 01:24:04,976
Your bird....
There was nothing l could do.

866
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:08,879
-He just caught fire.
-And about time too.

867
01:24:09,751 --> 01:24:12,049
He's been looking dreadful for days.

868
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:14,245
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.

869
01:24:16,157 --> 01:24:19,388
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

870
01:24:19,561 --> 01:24:22,928
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

871
01:24:23,098 --> 01:24:25,191
...and then they are...

872
01:24:25,367 --> 01:24:28,393
...reborn from the ashes.

873
01:24:36,811 --> 01:24:39,439
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

874
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:43,783
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

875
01:24:43,952 --> 01:24:46,785
Their tears have healing powers.

876
01:24:49,391 --> 01:24:52,451
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

877
01:24:53,428 --> 01:24:55,555
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.

878
01:24:56,731 --> 01:24:59,598
l'd be prepared to swear it
in front of the Ministry of Magic.

879
01:25:01,069 --> 01:25:02,969
Relax.

880
01:25:03,705 --> 01:25:05,673
l do not believe...

881
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,173
-...that Harry attacked anyone.
-Of course you don't.

882
01:25:13,081 --> 01:25:15,675
Right. Well, l'll....

883
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:18,978
-l'll just wait outside, then.
-Yes.

884
01:25:22,657 --> 01:25:26,320
-You don't think it was me, professor?
-No, Harry.

885
01:25:26,494 --> 01:25:28,985
l do not think it was you.

886
01:25:30,031 --> 01:25:31,828
But l must ask you...

887
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,496
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

888
01:25:42,944 --> 01:25:44,878
No, sir.

889
01:25:45,046 --> 01:25:46,536
Nothing.

890
01:25:49,551 --> 01:25:51,712
Very well, then.

891
01:25:51,886 --> 01:25:53,683
Off you go.

892
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:15,482
Hey, look, everyone.
lt's the Heir of Slytherin.

893
01:26:15,642 --> 01:26:19,922
Be careful. He's a seriously evil wizard.

894
01:26:20,962 --> 01:26:23,922
Come on, Harry. Fred and George
were just having a laugh.

895
01:26:24,082 --> 01:26:26,242
They're the only ones.

896
01:26:26,402 --> 01:26:30,562
So half the school thinks you nip off
to the Chamber of Secrets every night.

897
01:26:30,722 --> 01:26:31,762
Who cares?

898
01:26:32,482 --> 01:26:33,842
Maybe they're right.

899
01:26:35,922 --> 01:26:39,002
Harry. Harry.

900
01:26:40,442 --> 01:26:44,762
-Come on.
-l didn't know l can speak Parseltongue.

901
01:26:45,442 --> 01:26:48,122
What else don't l know about myself?

902
01:26:49,522 --> 01:26:51,162
Look...

903
01:26:52,522 --> 01:26:55,482
...maybe you can do something...

904
01:26:55,642 --> 01:27:00,122
...even something horrible,
and not know you did it.

905
01:27:00,522 --> 01:27:03,722
You don't believe that, Harry.
l know you don't.

906
01:27:04,682 --> 01:27:08,282
And if it makes you feel any better,
Malfoy's staying for the holidays too.

907
01:27:08,962 --> 01:27:11,242
Why would that make anyone
feel any better?

908
01:27:11,442 --> 01:27:15,802
Because in a few days
the Polyjuice Potion will be ready.

909
01:27:15,962 --> 01:27:21,362
ln a few days, we may truly know
who is the Heir of Slytherin.

910
01:27:46,827 --> 01:27:50,354
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

911
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:52,260
Crabbe and Goyle.

912
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:55,197
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

913
01:27:55,369 --> 01:27:58,600
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

914
01:27:58,939 --> 01:28:01,635
-How?
-l've got it all worked out.

915
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:04,369
l filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

916
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:07,309
Simple, but powerful.

917
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:09,709
Now, once they're asleep...

918
01:28:09,883 --> 01:28:13,080
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

919
01:28:13,253 --> 01:28:15,153
...and put on their uniforms.

920
01:28:15,322 --> 01:28:18,587
-Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
-l've already got mine.

921
01:28:18,759 --> 01:28:21,956
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

922
01:28:22,129 --> 01:28:24,290
l got this off her robes.

923
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:27,059
l'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

924
01:28:27,234 --> 01:28:29,964
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

925
01:28:42,082 --> 01:28:44,448
Ron, maybe l should do it.

926
01:28:44,618 --> 01:28:46,677
Yeah. Right.

927
01:28:48,889 --> 01:28:50,254
Wingardium Leviosa.

928
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:02,495
Cool.

929
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:27,457
How thick could you get?

930
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:29,596
Come on, let's get them.

931
01:29:44,811 --> 01:29:46,971
Well, did you get the hairs?

932
01:29:48,411 --> 01:29:50,131
-What are those?
-Slytherin robes.

933
01:29:50,331 --> 01:29:52,971
l had to sneak them from the laundry.

934
01:29:55,331 --> 01:29:56,851
Are we going to drink that?

935
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:01,251
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

936
01:30:14,945 --> 01:30:16,913
Add the hairs.

937
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:23,180
Essence of Crabbe.

938
01:30:23,353 --> 01:30:25,253
Cheers.

939
01:30:33,964 --> 01:30:36,398
l think l'm gonna be sick.

940
01:30:39,302 --> 01:30:41,133
Me too.

941
01:31:26,016 --> 01:31:27,745
Harry?

942
01:31:28,218 --> 01:31:29,776
Ron.

943
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:32,681
Bloody hell!

944
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:35,754
We still sound like ourselves.

945
01:31:35,925 --> 01:31:37,688
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

946
01:31:38,862 --> 01:31:41,160
-Bloody hell.
-Excellent.

947
01:31:41,498 --> 01:31:43,989
-But where's Hermione?
-l....

948
01:31:44,167 --> 01:31:47,159
l don't think l'm going.
You go on without me.

949
01:31:47,337 --> 01:31:49,032
Hermione, are you okay?

950
01:31:49,205 --> 01:31:52,038
Just go. You're wasting time.

951
01:31:54,110 --> 01:31:55,771
Come on.

952
01:31:59,282 --> 01:32:02,649
l think the Slytherin common room's
this way.

953
01:32:05,622 --> 01:32:08,090
Excuse me.

954
01:32:09,893 --> 01:32:11,827
What are you doing d--?

955
01:32:11,995 --> 01:32:14,054
l mean, what are you doing down here?

956
01:32:15,965 --> 01:32:18,695
l happen to be a school prefect.

957
01:32:18,868 --> 01:32:23,328
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

958
01:32:23,907 --> 01:32:25,738
What are your names again?

959
01:32:25,909 --> 01:32:29,902
-l'm....
-Crabbe, Goyle, where have you two been?

960
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,106
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

961
01:32:34,617 --> 01:32:36,915
Why are you wearing glasses?

962
01:32:37,754 --> 01:32:40,587
-Reading.
-Reading?

963
01:32:41,758 --> 01:32:44,056
l didn't know you could read.

964
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:49,023
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

965
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:51,224
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

966
01:33:00,009 --> 01:33:02,000
Well, sit down.

967
01:33:04,814 --> 01:33:08,648
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

968
01:33:08,885 --> 01:33:12,719
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

969
01:33:13,556 --> 01:33:15,820
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

970
01:33:18,061 --> 01:33:19,790
Stomachache.

971
01:33:21,798 --> 01:33:26,633
You know, l'm surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

972
01:33:26,803 --> 01:33:29,271
l suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

973
01:33:29,539 --> 01:33:31,939
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

974
01:33:32,108 --> 01:33:35,908
-...that ever happened to this place.
-You're wrong!

975
01:33:43,386 --> 01:33:44,580
What?

976
01:33:44,754 --> 01:33:48,417
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

977
01:33:48,591 --> 01:33:50,991
Well? Do you?

978
01:33:51,528 --> 01:33:53,393
Harry Potter?

979
01:33:59,969 --> 01:34:01,368
Good one, Goyle.

980
01:34:01,538 --> 01:34:03,096
You're absolutely right.

981
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:05,605
Saint Potter.

982
01:34:06,609 --> 01:34:09,373
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

983
01:34:13,149 --> 01:34:15,743
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

984
01:34:15,919 --> 01:34:19,616
You know l don't, Goyle.
l told you yesterday.

985
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:23,115
How many times do l have to tell you?

986
01:34:24,093 --> 01:34:25,958
ls this yours?

987
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,800
But my father did say this:

988
01:34:33,169 --> 01:34:36,070
lt's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

989
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:40,642
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

990
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:45,574
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

991
01:34:45,748 --> 01:34:50,048
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

992
01:34:50,653 --> 01:34:52,484
As for me...

993
01:34:52,655 --> 01:34:54,816
...l hope it's Granger.

994
01:34:54,991 --> 01:34:57,186
What's the matter with you two?

995
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,851
You're acting very odd.

996
01:35:00,029 --> 01:35:02,224
lt's his stomachache.

997
01:35:02,398 --> 01:35:04,457
Calm down.

998
01:35:08,638 --> 01:35:10,629
Scar.

999
01:35:14,244 --> 01:35:15,677
Hair.

1000
01:35:21,851 --> 01:35:24,217
Hey! Where are you going?

1001
01:35:46,823 --> 01:35:48,085
That was close.

1002
01:35:48,258 --> 01:35:50,692
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

1003
01:35:50,861 --> 01:35:52,726
Go away.

1004
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:57,132
Wait till you see. lt's awful.

1005
01:35:59,069 --> 01:36:00,832
Hermione?

1006
01:36:01,004 --> 01:36:02,631
Are you okay?

1007
01:36:04,674 --> 01:36:06,437
Do you remember me telling you...

1008
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:09,773
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

1009
01:36:09,946 --> 01:36:14,076
lt was cat hair l plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

1010
01:36:16,453 --> 01:36:18,011
Look at my face.

1011
01:36:19,155 --> 01:36:21,589
Look at your tail.

1012
01:36:28,164 --> 01:36:29,597
Have you spoken to Hermione?

1013
01:36:29,766 --> 01:36:32,326
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

1014
01:36:32,502 --> 01:36:35,300
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

1015
01:36:40,076 --> 01:36:41,839
What's this?

1016
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:47,474
Yuck!

1017
01:36:47,651 --> 01:36:50,449
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

1018
01:37:06,670 --> 01:37:10,800
-Come to throw something else at me?
-Why would l throw something at you?

1019
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:15,302
Don't ask me. Here l am,
minding my own business...

1020
01:37:15,478 --> 01:37:19,107
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

1021
01:37:19,316 --> 01:37:22,217
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

1022
01:37:22,385 --> 01:37:24,785
l mean, it'll just go
right through you.

1023
01:37:25,822 --> 01:37:30,225
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

1024
01:37:30,393 --> 01:37:32,987
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

1025
01:37:33,163 --> 01:37:36,655
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

1026
01:37:37,167 --> 01:37:41,604
-But who threw it at you, anyway?
-l don't know. l didn't see them.

1027
01:37:41,938 --> 01:37:46,170
l was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

1028
01:37:46,376 --> 01:37:50,073
...and it fell through the top
of my head.

1029
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:11,211
There's a name in this diary.

1030
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:15,811
Tom Marvolo Riddle.

1031
01:38:15,971 --> 01:38:17,851
Tom Marvolo Riddle?

1032
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:24,851
Hang on. l know that name.
Why do l know that name?

1033
01:38:25,331 --> 01:38:28,411
Of course. That night l had detention.

1034
01:38:28,571 --> 01:38:31,731
My job was to polish the silver
in the trophy room.

1035
01:38:31,891 --> 01:38:36,811
l remember because l kept burping up
slugs over Tom Riddle's trophy.

1036
01:38:37,611 --> 01:38:41,331
-What was the trophy for?
-He won an award. 50 years ago.

1037
01:38:41,491 --> 01:38:44,091
Special services to the
school or something.

1038
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:47,411
-50 years ago. Are you sure?
-Yeah. Why?

1039
01:38:48,051 --> 01:38:50,051
Don't you remember
what Malfoy told you?

1040
01:38:50,211 --> 01:38:51,691
The last time
the Chamber was opened was--

1041
01:38:51,851 --> 01:38:53,851
Fifty years ago.
But that means--

1042
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:57,531
Tom Riddle was here at Hogwarts
when it happened.

1043
01:38:57,731 --> 01:39:00,251
What if he wrote about what he saw?

1044
01:39:00,571 --> 01:39:02,491
lt's possible he knew
where the Chamber was...

1045
01:39:03,051 --> 01:39:06,931
...how to open it, even what sort
of creature lives in it.

1046
01:39:07,811 --> 01:39:12,611
lf so, whoever's behind these attacks
wouldn't want this diary lying around...

1047
01:39:12,771 --> 01:39:13,811
...would they?

1048
01:39:14,211 --> 01:39:18,171
That's a brilliant theory, Hermione,
but there's just one flaw.

1049
01:39:18,891 --> 01:39:21,611
There's nothing written in this diary.

1050
01:39:41,246 --> 01:39:43,046
Do you mind?

1051
01:39:50,957 --> 01:39:53,448
''Tom Marvolo Riddle.''

1052
01:40:22,885 --> 01:40:25,217
My name...

1053
01:40:25,388 --> 01:40:28,323
...is Harry...

1054
01:40:29,926 --> 01:40:32,053
...Potter.

1055
01:40:45,308 --> 01:40:50,473
Do you know anything...

1056
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:57,981
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

1057
01:41:08,097 --> 01:41:10,031
Can you...

1058
01:41:11,267 --> 01:41:13,565
...tell me?

1059
01:42:15,832 --> 01:42:19,268
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

1060
01:42:22,705 --> 01:42:25,037
Are you Tom Riddle?

1061
01:42:25,208 --> 01:42:27,005
Hello, can you hear me?

1062
01:42:47,597 --> 01:42:49,326
Riddle!

1063
01:42:49,932 --> 01:42:51,456
Come.

1064
01:42:51,634 --> 01:42:53,625
Professor Dumbledore.

1065
01:42:55,805 --> 01:42:57,966
Dumbledore?

1066
01:42:59,275 --> 01:43:02,733
lt is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

1067
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:06,245
Yes, professor. l suppose l....

1068
01:43:06,415 --> 01:43:08,610
l had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

1069
01:43:09,185 --> 01:43:12,086
l'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

1070
01:43:12,255 --> 01:43:15,122
About the school as well?
l don't have a home to go to.

1071
01:43:15,291 --> 01:43:18,124
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

1072
01:43:18,294 --> 01:43:20,819
l understand, Tom, but l'm afraid...

1073
01:43:21,597 --> 01:43:24,532
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

1074
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:29,194
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught....

1075
01:43:31,474 --> 01:43:33,567
ls there something...

1076
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:36,501
...you wish to tell me?

1077
01:43:37,713 --> 01:43:40,238
No, sir. Nothing.

1078
01:43:47,023 --> 01:43:50,049
Very well, then. Off you go.

1079
01:43:50,226 --> 01:43:52,091
Good night, sir.

1080
01:44:28,230 --> 01:44:31,131
-Let's get you out of there.
-Evening, Hagrid.

1081
01:44:31,467 --> 01:44:35,801
l'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid.
l don't think you meant it to kill anyone....

1082
01:44:35,972 --> 01:44:38,270
You can't. You don't understand.

1083
01:44:38,441 --> 01:44:41,569
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

1084
01:44:41,744 --> 01:44:44,645
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

1085
01:44:44,914 --> 01:44:48,042
lt wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

1086
01:44:48,351 --> 01:44:50,512
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

1087
01:44:50,686 --> 01:44:52,313
-Now, stand aside.
-No!

1088
01:44:52,488 --> 01:44:54,456
-Stand aside, Hagrid.
-No!

1089
01:44:54,624 --> 01:44:56,251
Cistem Aperio!

1090
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:05,565
Arania Exumai!

1091
01:45:06,435 --> 01:45:07,902
Aragog!

1092
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:09,298
Aragog!

1093
01:45:09,839 --> 01:45:11,238
l can't let you go.

1094
01:45:11,774 --> 01:45:15,073
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

1095
01:45:17,613 --> 01:45:19,478
Hagrid!

1096
01:45:47,921 --> 01:45:51,081
Ron. Ron, wake up.

1097
01:45:53,001 --> 01:45:54,401
What happened?

1098
01:45:54,561 --> 01:45:58,561
lt was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

1099
01:46:13,566 --> 01:46:16,535
lt can't be Hagrid.
lt just can't be.

1100
01:46:16,702 --> 01:46:20,763
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.

1101
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:24,432
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

1102
01:46:24,744 --> 01:46:28,703
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

1103
01:46:28,915 --> 01:46:31,577
That would be a cheerful visit.
''Hello, Hagrid.

1104
01:46:31,751 --> 01:46:35,585
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?''

1105
01:46:35,755 --> 01:46:38,952
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

1106
01:46:39,292 --> 01:46:40,281
No.

1107
01:46:44,797 --> 01:46:46,424
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

1108
01:46:46,866 --> 01:46:51,428
lt's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

1109
01:46:51,604 --> 01:46:55,267
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing up to do.

1110
01:46:55,441 --> 01:46:58,933
But once their acne's cleared up, we'll
be able to chop them up and stew them...

1111
01:46:59,111 --> 01:47:02,410
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

1112
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:06,751
ln the meantime, though, you three...

1113
01:47:06,919 --> 01:47:10,082
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

1114
01:47:17,964 --> 01:47:19,864
Hello, Neville.

1115
01:47:20,967 --> 01:47:23,458
Harry, l don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.

1116
01:47:23,836 --> 01:47:25,531
Come on!

1117
01:47:48,094 --> 01:47:52,121
lt had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

1118
01:47:52,298 --> 01:47:54,528
Unless it wasn't a student.

1119
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:58,136
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

1120
01:47:58,304 --> 01:47:59,703
And they found it.

1121
01:48:00,439 --> 01:48:02,964
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

1122
01:48:04,003 --> 01:48:05,300
All right, listen up.

1123
01:48:05,471 --> 01:48:08,372
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

1124
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:10,405
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

1125
01:48:10,576 --> 01:48:13,602
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

1126
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:17,237
-...if they fly anywhere near him.
-Well, that too.

1127
01:48:18,484 --> 01:48:20,008
Professor McGonagall.

1128
01:48:20,185 --> 01:48:23,211
-This match has been canceled.
-We can't cancel Quidditch.

1129
01:48:23,389 --> 01:48:28,349
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1130
01:48:28,527 --> 01:48:31,189
Potter, you and l will find Mr. Weasley.

1131
01:48:31,563 --> 01:48:34,088
There's something
the both of you have to see.

1132
01:48:36,201 --> 01:48:39,796
l warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1133
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:49,374
Hermione!

1134
01:48:49,548 --> 01:48:51,345
She was found near the library...

1135
01:48:52,584 --> 01:48:54,643
...along with this.

1136
01:48:56,088 --> 01:48:58,921
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1137
01:48:59,091 --> 01:49:00,558
No.

1138
01:49:14,773 --> 01:49:17,105
Could l have your attention, please?

1139
01:49:17,276 --> 01:49:22,908
Because of recent events, these new rules
will be put into effect immediately:

1140
01:49:23,248 --> 01:49:28,379
''All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1141
01:49:28,554 --> 01:49:32,615
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1142
01:49:32,791 --> 01:49:35,783
No exceptions.''

1143
01:49:36,462 --> 01:49:38,521
l should tell you this:

1144
01:49:38,697 --> 01:49:42,793
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1145
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:46,531
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1146
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,985
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
l can't believe it's him...

1147
01:50:01,153 --> 01:50:03,451
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1148
01:50:03,622 --> 01:50:06,785
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1149
01:50:06,959 --> 01:50:08,187
But you heard McGonagall.

1150
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:11,659
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1151
01:50:12,131 --> 01:50:14,599
l think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.

1152
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:25,740
Ready?

1153
01:50:46,213 --> 01:50:47,942
Who's there?

1154
01:50:51,752 --> 01:50:53,310
Hello?

1155
01:50:53,954 --> 01:50:55,478
Hello?

1156
01:50:56,657 --> 01:51:00,957
-What's that for?
-Nothing. l was expecting....

1157
01:51:01,128 --> 01:51:04,996
lt doesn't matter. Come on in.
l just made a pot of tea.

1158
01:51:07,735 --> 01:51:10,033
Hagrid, are you okay?

1159
01:51:10,204 --> 01:51:13,105
l'm fine. l'm all right.

1160
01:51:14,041 --> 01:51:15,770
Did you hear about Hermione?

1161
01:51:16,277 --> 01:51:19,906
Yeah. l heard about that, all right.

1162
01:51:20,281 --> 01:51:23,910
Look, we have to ask you something.

1163
01:51:25,619 --> 01:51:29,111
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1164
01:51:31,425 --> 01:51:33,723
What you had to understand
about that is--

1165
01:51:35,396 --> 01:51:36,988
Quick, under the cloak.

1166
01:51:37,665 --> 01:51:40,725
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.

1167
01:51:47,174 --> 01:51:50,234
-Professor Dumbledore, sir.
-Good evening, Hagrid.

1168
01:51:50,411 --> 01:51:52,845
l wonder, could we...?

1169
01:51:53,013 --> 01:51:55,504
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1170
01:51:55,683 --> 01:51:57,048
That's Dad's boss.

1171
01:51:57,218 --> 01:52:00,779
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1172
01:52:00,955 --> 01:52:05,358
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.

1173
01:52:05,526 --> 01:52:08,757
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1174
01:52:08,929 --> 01:52:12,160
-The Ministry's got to act.
-But l never--

1175
01:52:12,366 --> 01:52:14,129
You know l never, professor.

1176
01:52:14,301 --> 01:52:17,395
l want it understood, Cornelius...

1177
01:52:17,571 --> 01:52:19,402
...that Hagrid...

1178
01:52:19,573 --> 01:52:21,871
...has my full confidence.

1179
01:52:22,042 --> 01:52:25,842
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.

1180
01:52:26,013 --> 01:52:28,538
-l've got to take him.
-Take me?

1181
01:52:28,716 --> 01:52:31,014
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1182
01:52:31,285 --> 01:52:35,051
l'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1183
01:52:35,689 --> 01:52:37,589
Already here, Fudge?

1184
01:52:37,758 --> 01:52:39,089
Good.

1185
01:52:39,994 --> 01:52:42,758
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1186
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:44,954
Believe me...

1187
01:52:45,266 --> 01:52:49,464
...l take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your....

1188
01:52:51,338 --> 01:52:53,568
You call this a house?

1189
01:52:54,642 --> 01:52:55,666
No.

1190
01:52:55,843 --> 01:52:59,745
l simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1191
01:52:59,913 --> 01:53:03,974
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1192
01:53:04,551 --> 01:53:09,284
The other governors and l have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1193
01:53:10,924 --> 01:53:13,825
This is an order of suspension.

1194
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:22,767
You'll find all 1 2 signatures on it.

1195
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:30,838
l'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1196
01:53:31,578 --> 01:53:33,910
Well, what, with all these attacks...

1197
01:53:34,081 --> 01:53:36,845
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1198
01:53:37,017 --> 01:53:41,579
l can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1199
01:53:41,755 --> 01:53:43,950
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1200
01:53:44,224 --> 01:53:46,784
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1201
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:49,428
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1202
01:53:49,596 --> 01:53:51,223
You think so?

1203
01:53:51,398 --> 01:53:53,923
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1204
01:53:55,269 --> 01:53:57,999
lf the governors desire my removal...

1205
01:53:58,172 --> 01:54:01,869
...l will, of course, step aside.

1206
01:54:03,954 --> 01:54:06,184
However...

1207
01:54:06,857 --> 01:54:11,385
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1208
01:54:11,562 --> 01:54:13,462
...to those who...

1209
01:54:13,630 --> 01:54:15,962
...ask for it.

1210
01:54:22,773 --> 01:54:25,105
Admirable sentiments.

1211
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:27,072
Shall we?

1212
01:54:39,189 --> 01:54:40,713
Fudge.

1213
01:54:42,459 --> 01:54:44,290
Come, Hagrid.

1214
01:54:45,395 --> 01:54:46,953
Well?

1215
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:48,689
lf....

1216
01:54:49,099 --> 01:54:51,659
lf anybody was looking for some stuff...

1217
01:54:51,835 --> 01:54:56,704
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1218
01:54:56,874 --> 01:54:59,468
Yep. That would lead them right.

1219
01:54:59,643 --> 01:55:01,577
That's all l have to say.

1220
01:55:03,313 --> 01:55:07,044
And someone will need
to feed Fang while l'm away.

1221
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:12,411
Good boy.

1222
01:55:18,562 --> 01:55:20,689
Hagrid's right.

1223
01:55:20,864 --> 01:55:23,799
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1224
01:55:23,967 --> 01:55:25,628
Look.

1225
01:55:31,708 --> 01:55:33,505
Come on.

1226
01:55:37,214 --> 01:55:39,239
Come on, Fang.

1227
01:55:57,534 --> 01:55:58,899
Come on.

1228
01:55:59,069 --> 01:56:00,366
What?

1229
01:56:00,537 --> 01:56:03,768
You heard what Hagrid said.
''Follow the spiders.''

1230
01:56:03,941 --> 01:56:06,569
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1231
01:56:08,612 --> 01:56:13,072
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
''follow the butterflies''?

1232
01:57:27,269 --> 01:57:30,033
Harry, l don't like this.

1233
01:57:35,143 --> 01:57:38,340
-Harry, l don't like this at all.
-Shush!

1234
01:57:49,891 --> 01:57:52,416
Can we go back now?

1235
01:57:52,594 --> 01:57:54,323
Come on.

1236
01:58:44,045 --> 01:58:46,809
Who is it?

1237
01:58:47,482 --> 01:58:48,574
Don't panic.

1238
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:50,440
Hagrid?

1239
01:58:50,852 --> 01:58:52,444
ls that you?

1240
01:58:53,021 --> 01:58:54,955
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1241
01:59:13,041 --> 01:59:16,238
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?

1242
01:59:16,878 --> 01:59:18,175
Yes.

1243
01:59:18,346 --> 01:59:22,112
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1244
01:59:22,284 --> 01:59:25,412
He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.

1245
01:59:26,054 --> 01:59:27,919
They think it's Hagrid.

1246
01:59:28,156 --> 01:59:31,751
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1247
01:59:31,993 --> 01:59:34,291
That's a lie.

1248
01:59:34,796 --> 01:59:37,731
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1249
01:59:38,366 --> 01:59:41,233
-Then you're not the monster?
-No.

1250
01:59:41,403 --> 01:59:44,429
The monster was born in the castle.

1251
01:59:44,673 --> 01:59:49,940
l came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1252
01:59:50,545 --> 01:59:52,172
Harry.

1253
01:59:54,082 --> 01:59:58,644
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1254
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:01,812
We do not speak of it.

1255
02:00:02,157 --> 02:00:07,720
lt is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1256
02:00:07,896 --> 02:00:09,659
But have you seen it?

1257
02:00:10,332 --> 02:00:16,168
l never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.

1258
02:00:16,338 --> 02:00:19,501
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

1259
02:00:19,674 --> 02:00:24,168
When l was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1260
02:00:24,346 --> 02:00:26,371
-Harry!
-What?

1261
02:00:39,227 --> 02:00:42,219
Well, thank you.

1262
02:00:43,164 --> 02:00:45,325
We'll just go.

1263
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:47,563
Go?

1264
02:00:47,736 --> 02:00:49,499
l think not.

1265
02:00:49,671 --> 02:00:55,132
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1266
02:00:55,310 --> 02:00:57,710
But l cannot deny them
fresh meat...

1267
02:00:57,879 --> 02:01:02,213
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1268
02:01:02,417 --> 02:01:06,183
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1269
02:01:06,354 --> 02:01:08,185
Can we panic now?

1270
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:20,834
Know any spells?

1271
02:01:21,002 --> 02:01:24,165
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1272
02:01:24,339 --> 02:01:27,069
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1273
02:01:40,588 --> 02:01:41,885
Let's go!

1274
02:01:47,028 --> 02:01:49,087
Arania Exumai!

1275
02:01:54,402 --> 02:01:55,733
Go!

1276
02:02:13,722 --> 02:02:15,781
Glad we're out of there.

1277
02:02:22,764 --> 02:02:25,096
Arania Exumai!

1278
02:02:30,805 --> 02:02:34,571
-Thanks for that.
-Don't mention it.

1279
02:02:45,487 --> 02:02:47,648
Get us out of here.

1280
02:02:48,156 --> 02:02:49,851
Now!

1281
02:02:51,926 --> 02:02:56,158
Come on!
Come on, move faster!

1282
02:02:58,867 --> 02:03:00,198
Come on! Go!

1283
02:03:17,607 --> 02:03:19,666
Get us in the air.

1284
02:03:20,744 --> 02:03:22,211
The flying gear's jammed!

1285
02:03:26,316 --> 02:03:30,082
-Come on! Pull!
-l'm trying!

1286
02:03:59,416 --> 02:04:02,351
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1287
02:04:02,519 --> 02:04:06,853
lf Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
l'll kill him.

1288
02:04:20,837 --> 02:04:24,068
l mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1289
02:04:24,241 --> 02:04:28,837
-What have we found out?
-We know one thing.

1290
02:04:29,012 --> 02:04:32,413
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1291
02:04:32,616 --> 02:04:34,607
He was innocent.

1292
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:52,568
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1293
02:04:53,103 --> 02:04:55,367
We need you.

1294
02:04:56,306 --> 02:04:58,399
Now more than ever.

1295
02:05:15,325 --> 02:05:18,726
-What's that?
-Ron....

1296
02:05:19,563 --> 02:05:24,023
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1297
02:05:24,568 --> 02:05:25,830
Come on.

1298
02:05:26,503 --> 02:05:29,472
''Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1299
02:05:29,639 --> 02:05:34,269
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1300
02:05:34,444 --> 02:05:38,210
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.

1301
02:05:38,381 --> 02:05:41,373
Spiders flee before it.''
Ron, this is it.

1302
02:05:41,551 --> 02:05:44,349
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.

1303
02:05:44,521 --> 02:05:48,457
That's why l can hear it speak.
lt's a snake.

1304
02:05:48,792 --> 02:05:54,059
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1305
02:06:04,708 --> 02:06:07,609
Because no one did look it
in the eye.

1306
02:06:09,579 --> 02:06:12,173
Not directly, at least.

1307
02:06:13,416 --> 02:06:15,646
Colin saw it through his camera.

1308
02:06:15,819 --> 02:06:19,846
Justin-- Justin must have seen
the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1309
02:06:20,023 --> 02:06:24,016
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1310
02:06:24,194 --> 02:06:27,322
And Hermione had the mirror.

1311
02:06:27,497 --> 02:06:30,864
l bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1312
02:06:31,034 --> 02:06:32,296
And Mrs. Norris?

1313
02:06:32,469 --> 02:06:35,961
l'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1314
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:39,405
The water.

1315
02:06:39,876 --> 02:06:45,439
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1316
02:06:51,588 --> 02:06:53,522
''Spiders flee before it.''

1317
02:06:53,690 --> 02:06:57,421
-lt all fits.
-But how's a basilisk been getting around?

1318
02:06:57,594 --> 02:07:00,427
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1319
02:07:00,664 --> 02:07:06,261
-Hermione's answered that too.
-Pipes? lt's using the plumbing.

1320
02:07:06,436 --> 02:07:10,702
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1321
02:07:10,874 --> 02:07:15,106
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1322
02:07:15,779 --> 02:07:17,110
Moaning Myrtle.

1323
02:07:18,081 --> 02:07:22,108
All students are to return
to their house dormitories at once.

1324
02:07:22,285 --> 02:07:25,721
All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.

1325
02:07:30,727 --> 02:07:36,563
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1326
02:07:36,733 --> 02:07:38,928
Our worst fear has been realized.

1327
02:07:39,102 --> 02:07:43,664
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1328
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:50,407
The students must be sent home.
l'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1329
02:07:52,782 --> 02:07:55,216
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have l missed?

1330
02:07:55,385 --> 02:07:59,754
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1331
02:07:59,923 --> 02:08:02,858
-My moment?
-Weren't you saying just last night...

1332
02:08:03,026 --> 02:08:07,554
...that you've known all along where
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1333
02:08:08,932 --> 02:08:14,393
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1334
02:08:14,571 --> 02:08:19,770
-Your skills, after all, are legend.
-Very well.

1335
02:08:19,943 --> 02:08:23,140
l'll just be in my office getting....

1336
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:25,948
Getting ready.

1337
02:08:28,852 --> 02:08:32,049
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?

1338
02:08:32,222 --> 02:08:34,053
Ginny Weasley.

1339
02:08:45,468 --> 02:08:48,528
''Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever.''

1340
02:08:52,575 --> 02:08:54,372
Ginny.

1341
02:08:56,446 --> 02:08:59,938
Lockhart may be useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1342
02:09:00,116 --> 02:09:02,846
At least we can tell him
what we know.

1343
02:09:04,187 --> 02:09:06,747
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1344
02:09:08,525 --> 02:09:10,493
Are you going somewhere?

1345
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:13,754
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1346
02:09:13,930 --> 02:09:17,161
-What about my sister?
-Well....

1347
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:20,958
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than l.

1348
02:09:21,137 --> 02:09:25,130
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1349
02:09:25,308 --> 02:09:28,300
l must say, when l took the job,
there was nothing in the description--

1350
02:09:28,478 --> 02:09:29,638
You're running away?

1351
02:09:29,813 --> 02:09:32,611
-After all you did in your books?
-Books can be misleading.

1352
02:09:32,782 --> 02:09:35,342
-You wrote them.
-My dear boy, do use your common sense.

1353
02:09:35,518 --> 02:09:39,921
My books wouldn't have sold half as well
if people didn't think l'd done those things.

1354
02:09:40,490 --> 02:09:42,082
You're a fraud.

1355
02:09:42,258 --> 02:09:45,056
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1356
02:09:45,228 --> 02:09:47,162
ls there anything you can do?

1357
02:09:47,330 --> 02:09:52,063
Yes, now you mention it.
l'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1358
02:09:52,235 --> 02:09:54,726
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1359
02:09:54,904 --> 02:09:57,998
l'd never have sold another book.

1360
02:09:58,174 --> 02:10:03,908
ln fact, l'm going to have to do
the same to you.

1361
02:10:04,414 --> 02:10:07,178
Don't even think about it.

1362
02:10:18,061 --> 02:10:19,494
Who's there?

1363
02:10:21,931 --> 02:10:23,956
Hello, Harry.

1364
02:10:24,901 --> 02:10:30,066
-What do you want?
-To ask you how you died.

1365
02:10:32,442 --> 02:10:34,876
lt was dreadful.

1366
02:10:35,044 --> 02:10:38,741
lt happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1367
02:10:38,915 --> 02:10:42,942
l'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1368
02:10:43,119 --> 02:10:48,022
l was crying, and then
l heard somebody come in.

1369
02:10:48,191 --> 02:10:54,528
-Who was it, Myrtle?
-l don't know. l was distraught!

1370
02:10:55,832 --> 02:10:59,233
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

1371
02:10:59,402 --> 02:11:05,739
And l realized it was a boy, so l unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1372
02:11:06,943 --> 02:11:11,778
-...l died.
-Just like that? How?

1373
02:11:11,948 --> 02:11:16,442
l just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

1374
02:11:16,619 --> 02:11:20,453
...over there by that sink.

1375
02:11:45,548 --> 02:11:47,573
This is it.

1376
02:11:48,484 --> 02:11:53,285
This is it, Ron. l think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1377
02:11:55,291 --> 02:12:00,160
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.

1378
02:12:51,681 --> 02:12:55,777
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, l'll just be....

1379
02:12:55,952 --> 02:12:58,216
There's no need for me to stay.

1380
02:12:58,821 --> 02:13:00,721
Yes, there is.

1381
02:13:02,525 --> 02:13:05,619
-You first.
-Now, boys, what good will it do?

1382
02:13:05,795 --> 02:13:07,126
Better you than us.

1383
02:13:08,331 --> 02:13:11,266
But-- Obviously, yes.

1384
02:13:15,538 --> 02:13:18,268
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1385
02:13:25,081 --> 02:13:28,312
lt's really quite filthy down here.

1386
02:13:28,785 --> 02:13:33,313
-All right. Let's go.
-Oh, Harry?

1387
02:13:33,723 --> 02:13:38,660
lf you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1388
02:13:41,197 --> 02:13:43,165
Thanks, Myrtle.

1389
02:14:12,261 --> 02:14:17,460
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1390
02:14:18,401 --> 02:14:20,062
Go on.

1391
02:14:23,773 --> 02:14:25,104
This way.

1392
02:14:32,148 --> 02:14:37,381
-What's this?
-lt looks like a snake.

1393
02:14:37,553 --> 02:14:41,216
-lt's a snakeskin.
-Bloody hell.

1394
02:14:41,391 --> 02:14:47,193
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1395
02:14:49,098 --> 02:14:52,067
Heart of a lion, this one.

1396
02:14:55,772 --> 02:15:00,436
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.

1397
02:15:02,378 --> 02:15:07,839
The world will know our story.
How l was too late to save the girl.

1398
02:15:08,184 --> 02:15:11,676
How you two
tragically lost your minds...

1399
02:15:11,854 --> 02:15:14,823
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1400
02:15:15,691 --> 02:15:17,124
So....

1401
02:15:18,261 --> 02:15:20,593
You first, Mr. Potter.

1402
02:15:20,830 --> 02:15:23,993
Say goodbye to your memories.

1403
02:15:26,068 --> 02:15:28,002
Obliviate!

1404
02:16:01,938 --> 02:16:05,066
-Ron! Ron, are you okay?
-l'm fine.

1405
02:16:08,811 --> 02:16:10,574
Hello.

1406
02:16:11,247 --> 02:16:13,078
Who are you?

1407
02:16:14,450 --> 02:16:17,112
-Ron Weasley.
-Really?

1408
02:16:17,286 --> 02:16:20,153
And who am l?

1409
02:16:21,924 --> 02:16:26,224
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1410
02:16:26,562 --> 02:16:31,056
lt's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1411
02:16:31,234 --> 02:16:33,361
Do you live here?

1412
02:16:34,070 --> 02:16:36,595
-No.
-Really?

1413
02:16:41,177 --> 02:16:42,974
-What do l do now?
-You wait here...

1414
02:16:43,145 --> 02:16:46,080
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1415
02:16:46,249 --> 02:16:49,912
-l'll go on and find Ginny.
-Okay.

1416
02:18:23,145 --> 02:18:27,013
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.

1417
02:18:27,516 --> 02:18:29,609
Please wake up.

1418
02:18:29,885 --> 02:18:32,012
She won't wake.

1419
02:18:37,493 --> 02:18:41,827
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?

1420
02:18:41,998 --> 02:18:45,365
-She's not...?
-She's still alive, but only just.

1421
02:18:46,369 --> 02:18:48,667
-Are you a ghost?
-A memory...

1422
02:18:48,838 --> 02:18:51,238
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1423
02:18:53,909 --> 02:18:59,108
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.

1424
02:18:59,281 --> 02:19:01,681
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.

1425
02:19:01,851 --> 02:19:04,445
lt won't come until it's called.

1426
02:19:07,256 --> 02:19:10,054
-Give me my wand, Tom.
-You won't be needing it.

1427
02:19:11,127 --> 02:19:14,528
-We've got to go. We've got to save her.
-l'm afraid l can't do that.

1428
02:19:14,697 --> 02:19:18,724
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
l grow stronger.

1429
02:19:20,102 --> 02:19:24,596
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1430
02:19:24,774 --> 02:19:27,106
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1431
02:19:27,276 --> 02:19:30,473
lt was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1432
02:19:30,646 --> 02:19:33,080
...Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1433
02:19:33,249 --> 02:19:36,548
-But why?
-Because l told her to.

1434
02:19:36,719 --> 02:19:41,679
You'll find l can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1435
02:19:41,857 --> 02:19:45,190
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1436
02:19:45,728 --> 02:19:48,219
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1437
02:19:48,397 --> 02:19:50,763
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

1438
02:19:50,933 --> 02:19:55,302
And then who should find it but you?

1439
02:19:55,471 --> 02:19:58,565
The very person
l was most anxious to meet.

1440
02:19:59,175 --> 02:20:01,234
And why did you want to meet me?

1441
02:20:01,644 --> 02:20:05,011
l knew l had to talk to you,
meet you if l could.

1442
02:20:05,181 --> 02:20:08,446
So l decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1443
02:20:08,617 --> 02:20:11,780
-...to gain your trust.
-Hagrid's my friend.

1444
02:20:12,722 --> 02:20:17,318
-And you framed him, didn't you?
-lt was my word against Hagrid's.

1445
02:20:17,493 --> 02:20:20,758
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1446
02:20:20,930 --> 02:20:23,091
l'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

1447
02:20:23,265 --> 02:20:26,723
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1448
02:20:26,902 --> 02:20:30,201
l knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while l was still at school...

1449
02:20:30,372 --> 02:20:32,203
...so l decided to leave behind
a diary...

1450
02:20:32,374 --> 02:20:34,467
...preserving my 1 6-year-old self
in its pages...

1451
02:20:34,643 --> 02:20:37,339
...so that one day
l would be able to lead another...

1452
02:20:37,513 --> 02:20:40,311
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.

1453
02:20:40,483 --> 02:20:42,747
Well, you haven't finished it
this time.

1454
02:20:42,918 --> 02:20:45,887
ln a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1455
02:20:46,055 --> 02:20:48,785
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1456
02:20:49,191 --> 02:20:54,424
Haven't l told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1457
02:20:54,697 --> 02:20:59,464
For many months now,
my new target has been you.

1458
02:21:00,936 --> 02:21:04,531
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1459
02:21:04,707 --> 02:21:07,369
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1460
02:21:07,710 --> 02:21:10,645
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1461
02:21:10,813 --> 02:21:13,213
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?

1462
02:21:13,382 --> 02:21:17,546
Why do you care how l escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1463
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:24,182
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1464
02:21:44,613 --> 02:21:48,049
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1465
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:54,815
-You're Voldemort.
-Surely you didn't think...

1466
02:21:54,990 --> 02:21:59,484
...l was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?

1467
02:21:59,662 --> 02:22:03,826
No. l fashioned myself a new name,
a name l knew wizards everywhere...

1468
02:22:03,999 --> 02:22:08,197
...would one day fear to speak when l
became the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1469
02:22:08,370 --> 02:22:11,533
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1470
02:22:11,707 --> 02:22:15,108
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1471
02:22:15,277 --> 02:22:20,340
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1472
02:22:26,755 --> 02:22:27,744
Fawkes?

1473
02:22:44,039 --> 02:22:47,600
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1474
02:22:47,776 --> 02:22:51,473
A songbird and an old hat.

1475
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:09,288
Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort,
Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1476
02:23:09,465 --> 02:23:13,492
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1477
02:23:26,815 --> 02:23:31,149
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. lt only obeys me.

1478
02:24:01,350 --> 02:24:02,908
No!

1479
02:24:03,352 --> 02:24:07,846
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.

1480
02:25:49,858 --> 02:25:53,157
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1481
02:25:53,328 --> 02:25:58,231
ln a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and l will cease to be a memory.

1482
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:01,062
Lord Voldemort will return...

1483
02:26:01,437 --> 02:26:05,635
...very much alive.

1484
02:26:06,375 --> 02:26:07,774
Ginny?

1485
02:28:24,112 --> 02:28:25,704
Remarkable, isn't it...

1486
02:28:25,881 --> 02:28:29,874
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1487
02:28:30,052 --> 02:28:32,714
l'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1488
02:28:33,055 --> 02:28:37,082
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1489
02:28:42,097 --> 02:28:45,760
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

1490
02:28:45,934 --> 02:28:50,962
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1491
02:28:53,842 --> 02:28:55,673
What are you doing?

1492
02:28:58,480 --> 02:29:00,607
Stop. No!

1493
02:29:58,907 --> 02:30:02,866
lt was me.
But l swear, l didn't mean to.

1494
02:30:03,045 --> 02:30:06,537
Riddle made me, and....

1495
02:30:07,082 --> 02:30:09,710
Harry, you're hurt.

1496
02:30:10,085 --> 02:30:11,575
Don't worry.

1497
02:30:11,753 --> 02:30:15,382
Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.

1498
02:30:15,557 --> 02:30:18,822
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

1499
02:30:30,972 --> 02:30:33,099
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1500
02:30:34,209 --> 02:30:36,643
l just wasn't quick enough.

1501
02:30:57,432 --> 02:30:59,161
Of course.

1502
02:30:59,434 --> 02:31:02,301
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1503
02:31:03,905 --> 02:31:05,702
Thanks.

1504
02:31:07,442 --> 02:31:09,569
lt's all right, Ginny.

1505
02:31:10,712 --> 02:31:12,907
lt's over.

1506
02:31:13,915 --> 02:31:16,440
lt's just a memory.

1507
02:31:19,354 --> 02:31:24,690
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1508
02:31:35,971 --> 02:31:38,633
You both realize, of course...

1509
02:31:38,807 --> 02:31:44,302
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1510
02:31:44,980 --> 02:31:45,969
Yes, sir.

1511
02:31:46,148 --> 02:31:49,379
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1512
02:31:49,551 --> 02:31:50,745
Yes, sir.

1513
02:31:50,919 --> 02:31:53,683
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1514
02:31:55,223 --> 02:31:57,487
...that you both receive...

1515
02:31:57,993 --> 02:32:02,089
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1516
02:32:04,166 --> 02:32:06,031
Thanks, sir.

1517
02:32:06,601 --> 02:32:08,899
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1518
02:32:09,070 --> 02:32:13,234
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1519
02:32:14,342 --> 02:32:19,109
l believe we want
our gamekeeper back.

1520
02:32:24,085 --> 02:32:28,419
First, l want to thank you, Harry.

1521
02:32:29,057 --> 02:32:32,549
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1522
02:32:33,428 --> 02:32:37,990
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1523
02:32:40,402 --> 02:32:41,926
And...

1524
02:32:42,504 --> 02:32:43,937
...second...

1525
02:32:44,105 --> 02:32:48,872
...l sense that something
is troubling you.

1526
02:32:49,110 --> 02:32:51,601
Am l right, Harry?

1527
02:32:53,448 --> 02:32:55,177
lt's just....

1528
02:32:56,351 --> 02:33:01,084
You see, sir, l couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain....

1529
02:33:01,256 --> 02:33:06,888
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1530
02:33:07,462 --> 02:33:08,656
l see.

1531
02:33:08,830 --> 02:33:14,632
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1532
02:33:15,070 --> 02:33:20,599
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1533
02:33:21,810 --> 02:33:24,540
lf l'm not mistaken, Harry...

1534
02:33:24,946 --> 02:33:28,780
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1535
02:33:28,950 --> 02:33:31,885
...the night he gave you that scar.

1536
02:33:32,053 --> 02:33:35,955
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1537
02:33:37,859 --> 02:33:40,555
Not intentionally...

1538
02:33:41,463 --> 02:33:43,363
...but yes.

1539
02:33:45,300 --> 02:33:48,599
So the Sorting Hat was right.
l should be in Slytherin.

1540
02:33:48,770 --> 02:33:53,605
lt's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1541
02:33:53,775 --> 02:33:56,642
Determination, resourcefulness...

1542
02:33:56,811 --> 02:34:00,804
...and if l may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.

1543
02:34:01,483 --> 02:34:05,476
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1544
02:34:06,288 --> 02:34:09,985
-Because l asked it to.
-Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1545
02:34:10,158 --> 02:34:12,217
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

1546
02:34:12,394 --> 02:34:16,262
lt is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1547
02:34:16,565 --> 02:34:18,692
lt is our choices.

1548
02:34:22,370 --> 02:34:25,771
lf you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1549
02:34:25,941 --> 02:34:30,810
...then l suggest
you look more closely at this.

1550
02:34:31,813 --> 02:34:33,508
Be careful.

1551
02:34:39,154 --> 02:34:41,816
Godric Gryffindor.

1552
02:34:41,990 --> 02:34:46,086
lt would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1553
02:34:54,970 --> 02:34:56,369
Dobby.

1554
02:34:57,639 --> 02:35:02,008
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1555
02:35:04,212 --> 02:35:07,545
l'll deal with you later.

1556
02:35:13,388 --> 02:35:14,980
Out of my way, Potter.

1557
02:35:15,156 --> 02:35:18,751
So it's true. You have returned.

1558
02:35:19,427 --> 02:35:22,191
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1559
02:35:22,364 --> 02:35:26,562
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1560
02:35:27,402 --> 02:35:31,463
-Ridiculous.
-Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1561
02:35:31,640 --> 02:35:35,303
...were under the impression
that you would curse their family...

1562
02:35:35,477 --> 02:35:38,310
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1563
02:35:38,780 --> 02:35:42,238
-How dare you!
-Beg your pardon?

1564
02:35:42,417 --> 02:35:46,183
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1565
02:35:46,354 --> 02:35:49,187
...the welfare of this school...

1566
02:35:49,357 --> 02:35:53,657
...and, of course, its students.

1567
02:35:57,699 --> 02:36:01,897
The culprit has been identified,
l presume?

1568
02:36:02,303 --> 02:36:03,827
Yes.

1569
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:07,271
And?

1570
02:36:08,443 --> 02:36:10,468
Who was it?

1571
02:36:16,885 --> 02:36:19,445
Voldemort.

1572
02:36:20,588 --> 02:36:26,049
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1573
02:36:26,594 --> 02:36:30,223
...by means of this.

1574
02:36:32,901 --> 02:36:34,425
l see.

1575
02:36:35,904 --> 02:36:40,102
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.

1576
02:36:40,475 --> 02:36:44,138
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1577
02:36:44,312 --> 02:36:47,543
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1578
02:36:47,882 --> 02:36:51,818
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1579
02:36:52,187 --> 02:36:54,052
...severe.

1580
02:36:55,457 --> 02:36:58,255
Well, let us hope...

1581
02:36:58,426 --> 02:37:03,955
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1582
02:37:04,733 --> 02:37:08,499
Don't worry. l will be.

1583
02:37:17,245 --> 02:37:19,270
Dumbledore.

1584
02:37:20,415 --> 02:37:23,942
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1585
02:37:41,236 --> 02:37:45,673
Sir?
l wonder if l could have that?

1586
02:37:52,113 --> 02:37:53,705
Mr. Malfoy.

1587
02:37:53,882 --> 02:37:56,077
Mr. Malfoy!

1588
02:37:56,551 --> 02:37:58,712
l have something of yours.

1589
02:38:00,388 --> 02:38:03,323
Mine? l don't know
what you're talking about.

1590
02:38:03,558 --> 02:38:05,082
l think you do, sir.

1591
02:38:05,260 --> 02:38:08,354
l think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1592
02:38:08,530 --> 02:38:09,963
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1593
02:38:10,665 --> 02:38:13,190
You do, do you?

1594
02:38:20,575 --> 02:38:23,635
Why don't you prove it?

1595
02:38:29,884 --> 02:38:32,045
Come, Dobby.

1596
02:38:33,354 --> 02:38:35,379
Open it.

1597
02:38:38,927 --> 02:38:40,451
Dobby.

1598
02:38:40,628 --> 02:38:43,791
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1599
02:38:44,065 --> 02:38:46,158
What? l didn't give--

1600
02:38:46,334 --> 02:38:50,031
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1601
02:38:50,205 --> 02:38:53,265
Dobby is free.

1602
02:38:59,814 --> 02:39:03,545
You lost me my servant!

1603
02:39:10,525 --> 02:39:14,518
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1604
02:39:26,674 --> 02:39:30,371
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1605
02:39:30,545 --> 02:39:33,708
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1606
02:39:33,882 --> 02:39:39,081
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1607
02:39:44,792 --> 02:39:50,697
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1608
02:39:51,065 --> 02:39:55,297
-Just promise me something.
-Anything, sir.

1609
02:39:57,272 --> 02:39:59,740
Never try to save my life again.

1610
02:40:05,880 --> 02:40:08,872
-Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
-Thank you.

1611
02:40:09,183 --> 02:40:11,549
-Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
-Good evening.

1612
02:40:11,719 --> 02:40:14,620
-Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
-Thank you.

1613
02:40:16,024 --> 02:40:18,219
Hello.

1614
02:40:19,928 --> 02:40:24,558
-Hermione! Welcome back.
-Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1615
02:40:27,802 --> 02:40:31,135
Harry. lt's Hermione.

1616
02:40:57,966 --> 02:41:01,663
-Welcome back, Hermione.
-lt's good to be back.

1617
02:41:01,836 --> 02:41:04,430
Congratulations.
l can't believe you solved it.

1618
02:41:04,605 --> 02:41:06,869
We had loads of help from you.

1619
02:41:07,041 --> 02:41:10,272
-We couldn't have done it without you.
-Thanks.

1620
02:41:12,113 --> 02:41:15,082
Could l have your attention, please?

1621
02:41:19,220 --> 02:41:21,745
Before we begin the feast...

1622
02:41:21,923 --> 02:41:28,158
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1623
02:41:28,329 --> 02:41:32,459
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1624
02:41:32,633 --> 02:41:35,295
...to all who had been Petrified.

1625
02:41:45,813 --> 02:41:48,805
Also, in light of the recent events...

1626
02:41:48,983 --> 02:41:51,144
...as a school treat...

1627
02:41:51,319 --> 02:41:55,278
...all exams have been canceled.

1628
02:41:57,959 --> 02:41:59,517
Oh, no.

1629
02:42:16,477 --> 02:42:18,502
Sorry l'm late.

1630
02:42:24,552 --> 02:42:28,955
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1631
02:42:29,290 --> 02:42:32,589
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1632
02:42:48,376 --> 02:42:54,372
And l'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry and Ron...

1633
02:42:54,549 --> 02:42:57,484
...and Hermione, of course...

1634
02:42:58,152 --> 02:43:02,248
...l would still be you-know-where...

1635
02:43:02,423 --> 02:43:05,984
...so l'd just like to say thanks.

1636
02:43:15,403 --> 02:43:18,338
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.


1
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,310
Lumos Maxima.

2
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,360
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,090
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,260
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,140
Lumos Maxima!

6
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,130
Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,300
Harry, open the door.

8
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,510
Marge. How lovely to see...

9
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,100
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

10
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,600
What is it?

11
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,900
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,730
Later perhaps, if you behave.

13
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,110
I will if she does.

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,410
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

15
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,450
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

16
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,580
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

17
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,080
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. Vernon.

18
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,630
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,590
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,050
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

21
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,180
Okay.

22
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,430
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

23
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,400
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

24
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,560
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

25
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,150
A bit more.

26
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,990
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,780
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

28
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,870
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,080
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,380
What are you smirking at?

31
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,380
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

32
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,880
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,050
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

34
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,850
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,730
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

36
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,480
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

37
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,820
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

38
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,110
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,200
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

40
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,540
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

41
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,710
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

42
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,710
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

43
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,420
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

44
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,510
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,510
I think it's time you went to bed.

46
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,930
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

47
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,310
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

48
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,270
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

49
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,490
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

50
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,360
Shut up! Shut up!

51
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,120
Right.

52
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,410
Let me tell you...

53
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,980
Vernon!

54
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,820
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

55
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Stop!

56
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,410
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

57
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,830
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

58
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,920
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

59
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,960
Oh, Vernon.

60
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,880
Oh, God.

61
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,840
Marge!

62
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,100
Please!

63
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,940
Marge!

64
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,190
Come back!

65
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,590
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

66
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,010
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

67
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,600
- Keep away from me.
- You not allowed to do magic outside school.

68
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,810
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

69
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,310
You've nowhere to go.

70
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,820
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

71
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,790
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

72
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,330
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

73
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,460
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

74
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,640
What you doing down there?

75
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,550
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?

76
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,430
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

77
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,810
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

78
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,990
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

79
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,910
Well, come on, then. In.

80
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,910
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.

81
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,080
Come on.

82
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,720
Come on. Move on, move on, move on!

83
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,740
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

84
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,160
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

85
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,130
- What did you say your name was again?
- I didn't.

86
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,800
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

87
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,930
You hear that Ern? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

88
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,430
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

89
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,390
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

90
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,440
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

91
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,360
They don't see nothing, do they?

92
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,070
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

93
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,870
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

94
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,170
Ten, nine, eight...

95
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,090
...seven, six, five...

96
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,550
...four, three, three and a half...

97
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,550
...two, one and three quarters.

98
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,720
Yes!

99
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,430
Who is that?

100
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,020
That man.

101
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,480
Who is that?

102
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,190
Who is...?

103
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,780
That is Sirius Black, that is.

104
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,620
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

105
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,200
He's a murderer.

106
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,000
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

107
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,080
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

108
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,210
He's the first one that done it.

109
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,800
He was a big supporter of...

110
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,800
...You-Know-Who.

111
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,390
I reckon you've heard of him.

112
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,140
Yeah.

113
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,640
Him I've heard of.

114
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,980
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

115
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,150
They're getting closer, Ernie.

116
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,190
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

117
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,990
Mind your head.

118
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,830
Hey, guys? Guys?

119
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,210
Why the long faces?

120
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,470
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

121
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,310
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

122
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,320
Mr. Potter, at last.

123
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,030
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

124
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,050
Room 11.

125
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,980
Hedwig.

126
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,980
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

127
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,860
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

128
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,400
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

129
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,780
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

130
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,910
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

131
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,830
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

132
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,800
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

133
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,680
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

134
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,430
So that's that...

135
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,470
...and no harm done.

136
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,470
Pea soup?

137
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,770
No, thank you.

138
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,150
- Minister?
- Yes?

139
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,060
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

140
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,820
I broke the law. Underage wizards
aren't allowed to use magic at home.

141
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,030
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

142
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,740
...for blowing up their aunts.

143
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,250
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

144
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,880
...was very, very irresponsible.

145
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,880
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

146
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,880
Sirius Black, you mean?

147
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,800
But what's he got to do with me?

148
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,930
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

149
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,270
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

150
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,400
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

151
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,570
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

152
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,700
Hedwig.

153
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,960
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

154
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,710
...wander.

155
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,170
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

156
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,000
Housekeeping.

157
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,670
I'll come back later.

158
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,680
I'm warning you, Hermione.

159
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,560
Keep that bloody beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

160
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,810
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

161
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,980
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

162
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,700
- Looks like a pig with hair, lf u ask me.
- That's rich...

163
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,410
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

164
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,990
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

165
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,790
Harry.

166
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,290
Harry.

167
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,540
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

168
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,090
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

169
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,470
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

170
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,800
- Not flashing that clipping again, Are you Ron?
- I haven't shown anyone.

171
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,390
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

172
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,970
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

173
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,270
- The cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

174
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,850
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

175
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,190
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

176
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,690
- Got everything you need?
- Yes.

177
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,030
- Yes? All your books?
- Yea, It's all upstairs.

178
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,610
- Your clothes?
- Everything there.

179
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,200
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

180
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,240
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

181
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,910
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

182
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,750
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

183
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,540
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

184
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,460
Harry, there are some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

185
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,300
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

186
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,800
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

187
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,520
You are in danger.

188
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,690
Grave danger.

189
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,810
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

190
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,030
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

191
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,900
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

192
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,410
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

193
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,410
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

194
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,910
Sorry.

195
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,000
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

196
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,790
...Black lost everything.

197
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,250
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

198
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,590
And in his mind...

199
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

200
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,680
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

201
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,020
And that is why...

202
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,730
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

203
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,770
To find you.

204
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,860
And kill me.

205
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,490
Harry, would you swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

206
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,200
...you won't go looking for Black.

207
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,910
Mr. Weasley...

208
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,080
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

209
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,500
Quick. Quick.

210
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,620
Ron, Ron!

211
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,420
Oh, for goodness' sake!

212
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,090
Don't lose him!

213
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,220
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

214
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,840
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

215
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,600
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

216
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,520
I was lucky not to be arrested.

217
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,730
I still think it was brilliant.

218
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,650
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

219
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,860
Who do you think that is?

220
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,900
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

221
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,200
How is it she knows everything?

222
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,490
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

223
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,080
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

224
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,920
I gotta tell you something.

225
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,470
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

226
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
...to come after you?
- Yeah.

227
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

228
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,520
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

229
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,030
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

230
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,200
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

231
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,280
Why are we stopping?

232
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,080
We can't be there yet.

233
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,540
What's going on?

234
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,420
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

235
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,670
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

236
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,470
There's something moving out there.

237
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,110
I think someone's coming aboard.

238
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,180
Bloody hell! What's happening?

239
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,880
Harry.

240
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,800
Harry, are you all right?

241
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,640
Thank you.

242
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,270
Here, eat this. It'll help.

243
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,900
It's all right. It's chocolate.

244
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,280
What was that thing that came?

245
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,870
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

246
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,740
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

247
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,540
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

248
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,050
Eat. You'll feel better.

249
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,180
What happened to me?

250
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,100
Well, you sort of went rigid.

251
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,430
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

252
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,980
And did either of you two...

253
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,480
...you know...

254
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,730
...pass out?
- No.

255
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,610
I felt weird, though.

256
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,610
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

257
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,080
But someone was screaming.

258
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,620
A woman.

259
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,580
No one was screaming, Harry.

260
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,520
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

261
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,770
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

262
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,270
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

263
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,690
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

264
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,320
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

265
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,990
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

266
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,700
Good luck, professor.

267
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,630
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

268
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,460
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

269
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,300
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

270
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,470
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

271
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,010
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher for many years...

272
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,100
...has decided to retire...

273
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,020
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

274
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,940
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

275
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,940
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

276
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,450
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

277
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,500
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

278
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,210
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

279
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:04,590
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

280
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,720
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

281
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,350
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

282
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,190
Now whilst I've been assured...

283
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,030
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

284
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,530
...a word of caution.

285
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,900
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

286
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,490
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

287
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,290
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

288
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,080
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

289
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,960
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

290
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,390
But you know,
happiness can be found...

291
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,180
...even in the darkest of times...

292
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,270
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

293
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Fortuna Major.

294
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,790
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

295
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,920
- Fortuna Major.
- No, No, No! Wait, wait.

296
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,920
Watch this.

297
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,640
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.

298
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,400
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

299
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Still doing that after three years.

300
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,740
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

301
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,120
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

302
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,530
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

303
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,660
Green. That's a monkey.

304
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,130
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

305
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,500
Do not give him one again.

306
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,300
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

307
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,140
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

308
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,440
I think we have a winner.

309
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,730
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

310
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,860
Look at him. His face.

311
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,740
Welcome, my children.

312
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:18,040
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

313
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,500
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

314
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,880
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

315
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:33,680
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

316
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,720
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
which is the art of reading tea leaves.

317
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,480
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

318
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,350
What do you see?

319
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,190
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

320
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,820
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

321
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,530
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

322
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,620
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

323
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,460
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

324
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,920
Is your grandmother quite well?

325
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,040
I think so.

326
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:09,010
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

327
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,380
Pity.

328
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,220
Broaden your minds.

329
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:23,140
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

330
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,230
- I think you are.
- Sure.

331
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,650
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

332
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,530
Yeah.

333
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,780
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

334
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,870
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

335
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,410
So...

336
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,620
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

337
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,170
Give me the cup.

338
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,630
Oh, my dear boy.

339
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,380
My dear...

340
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,140
...you have the Grim.

341
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,720
The Grin? What's the Grin?

342
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,770
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

343
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,100
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

344
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,770
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

345
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,980
It's an omen...

346
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,990
...of death."

347
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:22,330
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black, do you?

348
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,420
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

349
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,290
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

350
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,590
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

351
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,420
A fair few.

352
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,680
Hang on. That's not possible.

353
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,640
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

354
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,810
You have to be in two
classes at once.

355
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,350
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

356
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,770
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

357
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,860
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

358
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,910
I got a real treat for you today.

359
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,070
A great lesson. So follow me.

360
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,420
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

361
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,090
And open your books to page 49.

362
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,880
Exactly how do we do that?

363
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,970
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

364
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,150
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

365
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,030
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

366
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,700
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

367
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,580
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

368
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,880
Shut up, Malfoy.

369
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,430
Dementor! Dementor!

370
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,530
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

371
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,160
Yeah.

372
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,380
Isn't he beautiful?

373
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,170
Say hello to Buckbeak.

374
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,010
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

375
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,260
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

376
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,930
First thing you wanna know about hippogriff
is they're very proud creatures.

377
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,020
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

378
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,940
It may just be the last thing you ever do.

379
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,480
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

380
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,110
Well done, Harry. Well done.

381
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,280
Come on now.

382
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,160
Now...

383
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,080
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

384
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,120
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

385
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,750
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

386
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,050
If he does, you can go and touch him.

387
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:21,420
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

388
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,140
Just make your bow.

389
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,390
Nice and low.

390
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,400
Back off, Harry. Back off.

391
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,780
Keep still.

392
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,450
Keep still.

393
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,040
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

394
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,090
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

395
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,130
Go on. Don't be shy.

396
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,020
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

397
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,770
Not so fast, Harry.

398
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,110
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

399
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,490
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

400
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,710
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

401
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,710
That's it...

402
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,670
Yes!

403
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,670
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

404
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Does he get to fly?

405
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,430
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

406
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,180
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

407
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,520
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

408
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,560
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

409
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,000
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

410
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,130
That was wicked, Harry!

411
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,710
Oh, please.

412
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,840
Well done, well done.

413
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,720
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

414
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,350
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

415
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,940
Malfoy, no...

416
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,310
No!

417
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,650
Buckbeak!

418
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,990
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

419
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,950
Whoa! Buckbeak!

420
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,410
Away, you silly creature...

421
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,700
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

422
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,120
Hagrid!

423
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:25,500
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

424
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,420
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

425
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,880
You and your bloody chicken!

426
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,410
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

427
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,460
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

428
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,960
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

429
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,170
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

430
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,680
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

431
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,600
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

432
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,640
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

433
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,560
Sirius Black!

434
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

435
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,650
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

436
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,320
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

437
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,820
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

438
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:40,580
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

439
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,540
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

440
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,730
Intriguing, isn't it?

441
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,740
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

442
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,700
...as to what is inside?

443
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,910
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

444
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,580
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

445
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,840
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

446
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,550
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

447
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,970
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

448
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,590
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

449
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,270
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

450
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,400
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

451
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,190
After me. Riddikulus!

452
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,530
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.

453
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,240
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

454
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,660
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!

455
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,950
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

456
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,160
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

457
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:12,080
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

458
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:16,710
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

459
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,010
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

460
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,550
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,220
Come on.

462
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,190
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

463
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,060
Professor Snape.

464
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,110
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

465
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,690
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

466
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,370
- I believe,You live with your grandmother.
- Yes but I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either.

467
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,450
No...

468
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,080
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

469
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,540
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

470
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,840
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

471
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,880
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

472
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,390
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

473
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,760
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

474
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,680
Can you do that?

475
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,980
Yes. Wand at the ready.

476
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,810
One, two, three.

477
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,490
Think, Neville, think.

478
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,290
Riddikulus!

479
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,500
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

480
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,630
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

481
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,180
Form a line!

482
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,770
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

483
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,060
...and turn it into something funny.

484
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,980
Next! Ron!

485
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,740
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

486
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,750
Wand at the ready, Ron.

487
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,340
Riddikulus!

488
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,840
Yes!

489
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:25,340
You see? Very good, very good!

490
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:31,680
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

491
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,690
Show us what you see.

492
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,370
Keep your nerve. Steady.

493
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,490
Riddikulus!

494
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,500
And next! Step up, step up!

495
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,420
Wonderful, wonderful!

496
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,560
Here!

497
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,230
Riddikulus!

498
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,660
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

499
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,830
Collect your books from the back of the class.

500
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,620
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

501
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,830
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

502
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,420
Now remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

503
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,550
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school on any way...

504
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,640
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

505
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,390
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

506
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,100
That's the rule, Potter.

507
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:01,520
All those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

508
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,190
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...

509
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,860
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

510
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,240
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

511
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:17,120
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

512
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,580
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

513
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,430
Professor, can I ask you something?

514
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,480
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

515
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,110
I thought it'd be obvious.

516
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,110
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

517
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,780
I did think of Voldemort at first.

518
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,620
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

519
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,330
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

520
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,370
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

521
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,040
This is very wise.

522
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,290
Before I fainted...

523
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,540
...I heard something.

524
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,710
A woman...

525
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,510
...screaming.

526
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,970
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

527
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,100
Our pain becomes their power.

528
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,140
I think it was my mother...

529
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,520
...the night she was murdered.

530
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,610
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

531
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,030
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

532
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,610
They're your mother, Lily's.

533
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:34,990
Yes.

534
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,330
Oh, yes. I knew her.

535
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,500
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

536
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:47,920
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

537
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:51,420
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

538
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,010
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

539
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:01,350
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

540
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:05,520
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

541
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,230
...he...

542
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:11,070
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

543
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,870
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

544
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:25,830
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

545
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:29,800
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

546
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,640
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

547
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,390
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

548
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,600
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.

549
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,480
What's going on?

550
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,110
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

551
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,690
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

552
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:57,160
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

553
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,450
Get back, all of you.

554
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,790
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

555
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,290
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

556
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,840
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

557
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,920
It's not funny, Ron.

558
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,010
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

559
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:25,390
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

560
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,560
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

561
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,650
You heard. Move!

562
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,750
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

563
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,170
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

564
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,460
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

565
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,430
The Fat Lady's there.

566
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,260
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

567
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,510
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

568
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,100
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

569
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,570
Dear lady, who did this to you?

570
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,530
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

571
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:23,450
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

572
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,080
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

573
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,500
Sirius Black!

574
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:33,840
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

575
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:06,830
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

576
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,540
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

577
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,710
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.

578
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,540
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

579
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,250
I didn't really expect him to linger.

580
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:20,840
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

581
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,300
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

582
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:26,140
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

583
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,180
Any theories on how he managed it?

584
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,350
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

585
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,150
You may recall...

586
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:36,150
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

587
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,400
...about your appointment
of Professor...

588
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,660
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

589
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,240
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...

590
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,040
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

591
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,540
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

592
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,380
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

593
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,960
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

594
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:06,760
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

595
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,430
Turn to page 394.

596
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:00,440
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

597
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:04,570
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

598
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,620
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

599
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:13,870
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

600
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,380
"Werewolves"?

601
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,460
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

602
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,840
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

603
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:30,220
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

604
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:34,350
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

605
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,980
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

606
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,610
No one?

607
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:43,030
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

608
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,400
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

609
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,110
A werewolf has no choice.

610
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,240
With each full moon...

611
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:54,290
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

612
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,080
Further more, the werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

613
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,000
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

614
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:04,510
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

615
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,670
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

616
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,180
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

617
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,890
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

618
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,690
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

619
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:22,610
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

620
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,320
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

621
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,780
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

622
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:34,040
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

623
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,000
Page 394.

624
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,460
The term "werewolf"...

625
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:46,880
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

626
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:52,050
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

627
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,060
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

628
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,270
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

629
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,440
...being bitten by a werewolf...

630
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,880
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

631
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,500
Aresto momentum!

632
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,880
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

633
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,340
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet here.

634
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,380
Come on Ron, let's walk you off the Astronomy Tower
and see what you look like.

635
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,640
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

636
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:46,270
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

637
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,440
You gave us a right good scare there mate.

638
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:52,190
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

639
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,820
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

640
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,950
No one blames you, Harry.

641
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,000
Dementors aren't supposed to come inside
the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

642
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,290
After he saved you,
he sent them straight off.

643
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:11,130
There's something else
you should know too, Harry.

644
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:18,010
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

645
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,010
Well...

646
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,560
I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

647
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:26,520
Is there no chance of fixing it?

648
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,060
No.

649
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:31,560
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

650
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,070
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

651
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:38,400
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

652
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:42,870
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

653
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:48,000
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

654
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:52,420
You are not weak, Harry.

655
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:56,670
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

656
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,970
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

657
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,720
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

658
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:06,970
- I'm scared, professor.
- Well!, I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

659
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,650
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

660
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:12,810
You made the one
on the train go away.

661
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,770
There was only one that night.

662
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:19,650
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

663
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:24,950
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an particular interest in you...

664
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,790
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

665
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,870
For now, I need to rest.

666
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,610
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

667
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:18,210
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

668
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,300
- But not clever enough.
- Beside, We've got a better way.

669
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:24,300
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

670
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:25,680
We'll get you there.

671
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,560
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.

672
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,310
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

673
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,520
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

674
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,070
What are you doing?!

675
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,150
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

676
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,660
- That map, it's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me...

677
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,740
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

678
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,660
George, if you will.

679
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:54,120
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

680
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:01,340
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...

681
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,720
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

682
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,220
We owe them so much.

683
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:14,600
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

684
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:17,230
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

685
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,730
- In his study.
- Pacing.

686
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,860
Does that a lot.

687
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,900
- So you mean this map shows...
- Everyone. Everyone.

688
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,110
- Everyone, where they are.
- What they're doing.

689
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,410
- Every minute.
- Every day.

690
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,580
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- Nicked it from Filch's office of course.

691
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:32,500
- First year.
- Now listen, there are seven secret passageways...

692
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,330
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

693
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,670
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you straight to Honeyduke's Cellar.

694
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,670
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

695
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,260
Oh and Harry don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

696
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:48,760
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

697
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:26,300
Now, how much do you want?

698
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,520
Delicious.

699
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,610
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

700
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,450
Twice.

701
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,490
Do you want to move a bit closer?

702
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,410
To the Shrieking Shack?

703
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,580
Actually, I'm fine here.

704
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,580
Well, well. Look who's here.

705
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,250
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

706
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,760
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

707
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,180
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

708
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:15,600
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

709
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:19,230
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

710
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,400
You filthy little mudblood!

711
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:27,150
Who is that?

712
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,740
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

713
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:57,850
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

714
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,230
Get out of the way!

715
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,020
Move!

716
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,480
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

717
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,200
Harry!

718
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:18,410
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

719
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:22,830
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

720
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,460
Harry not gonna keep it. He gonna turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

721
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:30,670
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

722
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,340
Oh look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

723
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:35,850
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

724
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:37,890
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

725
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,430
Allow me, minister.

726
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,480
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

727
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,600
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

728
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:48,690
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

729
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:52,900
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

730
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,530
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

731
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:59,330
And what would bring him here?

732
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:03,660
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

733
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,580
Come.

734
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:10,130
Harry!

735
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:22,310
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

736
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,520
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

737
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,350
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!

738
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,730
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

739
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,400
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

740
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:38,490
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

741
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:43,080
Now tell me what this is all about.

742
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:47,710
Well now years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

743
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,540
Remember? They went into hiding.
Few knew where they were.

744
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:54,590
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

745
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,010
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

746
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,560
...but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew!

747
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:03,980
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

748
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,390
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- I remember.

749
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,400
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

750
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,320
- But what happened?
- Well Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters...

751
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:15,650
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

752
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:19,700
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

753
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:22,080
He destroyed him!

754
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:27,460
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

755
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:30,670
Yes Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

756
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,050
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- And now he wants to finish what he started.

757
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:37,090
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

758
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,050
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

759
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,390
...and remains to this day...

760
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:45,470
...Harry Potter's godfather!

761
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:56,400
Ron, look!

762
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,660
- Sorry, Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me, Sorry.
- Merry Christmas.

763
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,990
Harry, what happened?

764
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,620
He was their friend...

765
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,380
...and he betrayed them.

766
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:55,130
He was their friend!

767
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,340
I hope he finds me.

768
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:02,300
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

769
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,390
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

770
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:21,280
Harry.

771
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:23,450
There you are. You came.

772
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:27,700
Are you sure about this, Harry?
Now this is very advanced magic...

773
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:30,330
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

774
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,040
I'm sure.

775
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,080
Well, everything's prepared.

776
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:38,710
Now the spell I'm going to try and teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

777
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,380
Did you ever hear of it?

778
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:42,220
No? Well...

779
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:45,970
A Patronus is a kind of positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

780
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:50,810
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

781
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,810
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

782
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:58,940
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

783
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:02,950
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

784
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,370
Close your eyes.

785
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,040
Concentrate.

786
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:13,370
Explore your past.

787
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:15,750
Do you have a memory?

788
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,550
Allow it to fill you up.

789
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:22,340
Lose yourself within it.

790
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:28,010
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.

791
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,270
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.

792
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:38,400
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

793
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,830
Expecto Patronum!

794
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:02,960
Expecto... Expecto...

795
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:04,920
Expect...

796
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:11,010
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

797
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:15,100
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

798
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,650
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

799
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,360
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

800
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:27,320
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

801
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:30,660
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

802
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,450
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

803
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:37,330
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

804
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,880
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

805
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:53,970
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

806
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:58,060
Well, it is.

807
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:00,810
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

808
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:04,900
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?

809
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,160
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

810
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,700
Just do it.

811
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,010
Expecto Patronum!

812
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:34,180
Expecto Patronum!

813
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:56,910
Yes!

814
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:02,290
Well done, Harry. Well done!

815
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:06,960
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

816
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,550
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

817
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,510
And just so you know, Harry...

818
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,680
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

819
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:17,890
...is saying something.

820
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,060
I was thinking of him.

821
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,400
And Mum.

822
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,820
Seeing their faces.

823
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,150
They were talking to me.

824
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,570
Just talking.

825
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:35,070
That's the memory I chose.

826
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,160
I don't even know if it's real.

827
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,830
But it's the best I have.

828
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:53,380
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

829
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,550
Unless of course you've been ripped to pieces!

830
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,140
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

831
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:01,480
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

832
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,770
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

833
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:07,270
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

834
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,360
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

835
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:14,410
Well, maybe you should learn to
take better care of your pets!

836
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:16,660
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

837
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:18,330
- Did.
- Didn't.

838
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:23,000
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

839
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,460
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

840
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:29,300
...talking about why we were there.

841
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:33,840
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

842
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:36,970
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

843
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:40,220
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

844
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:43,600
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

845
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:46,810
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

846
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,810
And then?

847
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,230
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

848
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,530
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

849
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,620
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

850
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:34,030
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

851
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,780
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.

852
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:40,950
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

853
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:01,260
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

854
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:04,560
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.

855
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:07,230
He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!

856
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,780
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

857
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:06,160
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

858
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,960
Mischief managed. Nox.

859
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:20,510
Potter.

860
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,180
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

861
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:25,510
I was sleepwalking.

862
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,220
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

863
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:33,150
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

864
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:37,690
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

865
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,530
If you don't mind, I would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.

866
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,950
Turn out your pockets.

867
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:51,250
Turn out your pockets!

868
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:55,790
What's this?

869
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,210
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

870
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:09,470
Reveal your secrets.

871
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:14,730
Read it.

872
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:22,700
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

873
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:26,990
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

874
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,780
Go on.

875
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:33,830
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

876
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,580
- You insolent little...
- Professor!

877
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:40,920
Well, well. Lupin.

878
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:45,800
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?

879
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:49,600
Harry, are you all right?

880
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:52,270
That remains to be seen.

881
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,850
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

882
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:00,570
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

883
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:05,530
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

884
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,200
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

885
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:13,250
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

886
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:17,670
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

887
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:20,960
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

888
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:24,470
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

889
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,220
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

890
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,770
Come in.

891
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:46,780
I haven't the faintest idea Harry how this map
came to be in your possession...

892
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:51,450
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

893
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:55,290
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

894
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:57,460
...is a map to you?

895
01:17:58,290 --> 01:18:00,750
- No.
- No, sir.

896
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:05,800
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

897
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:10,300
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

898
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:15,020
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering around the castle unprotected...

899
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:19,650
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a pretty poor way to repay them!

900
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:22,020
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

901
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:24,650
- Harry, Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

902
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:28,490
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

903
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:33,410
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

904
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,500
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

905
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:48,340
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

906
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,510
Oh, really? And who might that be?

907
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,220
Peter Pettigrew.

908
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:57,930
That's not possible.

909
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,810
It's just what I saw.

910
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:05,360
Good night, professor.

911
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:13,030
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

912
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:18,620
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

913
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:22,120
Only then can you see. Try again.

914
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,750
Now, what do we have here?

915
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:29,300
Do you mind me trying?

916
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,680
The Grim, possibly.

917
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:40,940
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

918
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,900
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

919
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:48,990
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

920
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:52,820
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

921
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:56,990
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

922
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,290
...to which you so desperately cleave.

923
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,810
Have I said something?

924
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:27,480
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
I mean not that she wasn't always mental...

925
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:30,230
...but now it's out in the open
for everyone to see.

926
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,570
Hang on.

927
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,660
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

928
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:39,410
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

929
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:22,450
Harry Potter...

930
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:33,590
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

931
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,380
Sorry?

932
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:40,220
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

933
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:42,430
...shall break free.

934
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,850
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

935
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:51,020
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

936
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,620
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

937
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:03,200
No.

938
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,200
Nothing.

939
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,840
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

940
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,760
- It just got worse.
- Now What did I tell u? Father said...

941
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:09,100
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
Think I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

942
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:11,730
This is going to be rich.

943
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:14,110
- Look who's here.
- Ah! Come to see the show?

944
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:17,400
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

945
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:19,320
Hermione, no!

946
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,160
He's not worth it.

947
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,300
Malfoy, are you okay?

948
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:42,720
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

949
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:47,310
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

950
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:11,040
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

951
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:13,500
Why don't we just set him free?

952
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:16,090
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

953
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:19,260
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, you know? Dumbledore.

954
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:21,800
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

955
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,840
When it happens.

956
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:26,350
Great man, Dumbledore.

957
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:28,890
A great man.

958
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:34,350
- We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.
- You'll do no such thing!

959
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,690
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

960
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:41,530
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

961
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:51,330
Scabbers! You're alive!

962
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:55,210
- Keep a closer eye on your pet, Ron.
- I think you owe someone an apology.

963
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:59,130
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

964
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,380
I meant me!

965
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:03,300
Blimey. What was that?

966
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,180
Hagrid!

967
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,440
Oh, crikey.

968
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:18,650
No, minister. Over this way.

969
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:22,940
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

970
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:26,910
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

971
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:30,660
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

972
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,500
Quick. Quick!

973
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,420
Hagrid.

974
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:40,500
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

975
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:45,130
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.

976
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,970
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

977
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,850
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

978
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:54,890
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

979
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:59,560
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

980
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:03,110
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

981
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,860
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

982
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:11,200
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

983
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:16,870
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

984
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,590
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

985
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:25,170
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

986
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,090
What?

987
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,340
I thought I just saw...

988
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:31,640
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

989
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:39,060
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

990
01:27:25,570 --> 01:27:27,030
Oh, no.

991
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:40,160
He bit me. Scabbers.

992
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,710
Ron. Ron!

993
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:47,210
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

994
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:50,470
Wait!

995
01:27:56,390 --> 01:28:00,690
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

996
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:03,150
That's not good. Ron, run!

997
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:08,820
Harry, Hermione, run!

998
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,030
It's the Grim!

999
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:21,080
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1000
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:23,290
Harry!

1001
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,250
- Help!
- Ron!

1002
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:32,630
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1003
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,480
Come on!

1004
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,820
Move!

1005
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:58,620
Duck!

1006
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:36,780
Harry!

1007
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:55,680
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1008
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,760
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

1009
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:01,810
I just hope I'm wrong.

1010
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:24,660
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1011
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,370
Come on.

1012
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,140
Ron.

1013
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,310
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1014
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:45,730
Harry! It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1015
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:02,410
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1016
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:04,370
No. Only one will die tonight.

1017
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:06,500
Then it'll be you!

1018
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:14,880
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1019
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:17,920
Expelliarmus!

1020
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:25,810
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1021
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:29,060
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1022
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:33,270
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you Remus?

1023
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:44,740
- I found him.
- I know.

1024
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:46,200
- It's him.
- I understand.

1025
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:49,580
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1026
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,750
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1027
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:57,510
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1028
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,010
How long have you known?

1029
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:05,720
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well well well, Hermione.

1030
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:08,850
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1031
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:11,440
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1032
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,270
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

1033
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:16,860
Twelve years of it!

1034
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,860
In Azkaban!

1035
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:31,080
Very well. Kill him.

1036
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:35,420
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1037
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:37,170
I know why.

1038
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:39,630
You betrayed my parents.

1039
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,720
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, Harry, it wasn't him.

1040
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,800
Somebody did betray your parents...

1041
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:48,470
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1042
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:52,140
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1043
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:55,440
And he's in this room! Right now!

1044
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:58,900
Come out, come out, Peter!

1045
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:02,070
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!

1046
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:07,530
Vengeance is sweet.

1047
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,950
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1048
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,450
Severus...

1049
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:16,380
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
old friend into the castle and now here's the proof.

1050
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:17,880
Brilliant, Snape.

1051
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:22,420
Once again, You've put your keen and penetrating mind to the task
and as usual come to the wrong conclusion.

1052
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:25,300
Now if you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have some unfinished business...

1053
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:30,470
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

1054
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:33,230
- Severus, don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

1055
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:35,020
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself! Remus!

1056
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:37,610
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1057
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:40,320
Why dont you run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1058
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,360
I could do it, you know.

1059
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:49,450
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1060
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:52,330
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1061
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:56,000
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like to endure.

1062
01:33:56,170 --> 01:34:01,590
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

1063
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,050
Severus, please.

1064
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:07,090
After you.

1065
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:13,270
Expelliarmus!

1066
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:18,600
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1067
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:21,400
- Tell me about Peter Pettigrew.
- He was at school with us.

1068
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:23,230
We thought he was our friend!

1069
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,400
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1070
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:29,780
I thought so too, until you mentioned
seeing Pettigrew on the map!

1071
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:32,790
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1072
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:36,960
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1073
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:42,000
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

1074
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:45,420
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

1075
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:48,090
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1076
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:50,850
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

1077
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:53,970
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!

1078
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:57,440
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1079
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,650
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1080
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:06,320
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1081
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:07,570
Scabbers!

1082
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:10,820
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1083
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,140
Remus?

1084
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:37,390
Sirius.

1085
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,480
My old friends!

1086
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:48,950
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1087
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:52,780
- Like James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!

1088
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:56,240
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1089
01:35:56,450 --> 01:36:01,670
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort! didnt you?!
- I didn't mean to!

1090
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:04,670
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1091
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,510
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1092
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:13,470
- What would you have done?
- I Would rather die!,I Would have died, rather than betray my friends!

1093
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:18,020
Harry!, James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1094
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:23,900
Your dad..your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1095
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,570
Should have realized Peter!, if Voldemort
didn't kill you, then we would. Together!

1096
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,820
No!

1097
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:36,280
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.

1098
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:38,370
But we'll take him to the castle.

1099
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:43,580
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

1100
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,130
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1101
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,710
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1102
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:57,390
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1103
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:01,100
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1104
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:02,810
I was going for the rat.

1105
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:06,810
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

1106
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:12,240
In fact more than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1107
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:17,280
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1108
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,340
Okay.

1109
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:38,890
- You better go.
- No, No. Don't worry, okay?

1110
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,470
It's fine. I'll stay.

1111
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:43,230
You go, I'll stay.

1112
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,650
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1113
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:51,230
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1114
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,990
They might chop it.

1115
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:57,110
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1116
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:01,490
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1117
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:04,580
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1118
01:38:05,410 --> 01:38:09,170
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1119
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:13,050
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1120
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:18,010
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1121
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,970
He doesn't deserve it.

1122
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:24,310
Well I just didn't think my dad
would have wanted his two best friends...

1123
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,020
...to become killers.

1124
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:29,900
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1125
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:32,440
Alive, you're free.

1126
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:35,700
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1127
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:39,240
Ron! Haven't I been a good friend, a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1128
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:41,910
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1129
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:46,120
- Sweet girl, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

1130
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:50,500
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1131
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:54,760
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1132
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,880
I know.

1133
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:02,100
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1134
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:04,770
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1135
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:07,440
What? Come and live with you?

1136
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:11,900
Well, It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1137
01:39:12,110 --> 01:39:13,650
Harry!

1138
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:32,750
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1139
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:39,430
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! This heart here!

1140
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:42,760
This flesh is only flesh!

1141
01:39:43,930 --> 01:39:46,020
Expelliarmus!

1142
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:57,650
Harry!

1143
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:01,700
Remus! Remus!

1144
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:10,250
Run! Run!

1145
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:22,300
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1146
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:27,560
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1147
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:29,980
Professor?

1148
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:35,610
Professor Lupin?

1149
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:46,620
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1150
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:49,580
There you are, Potter!

1151
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,410
Sirius!

1152
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,660
Come back here, Potter!

1153
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:34,890
Sirius!

1154
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:38,650
No. Sirius!

1155
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:23,400
Expecto Patronum!

1156
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:38,580
Harry?

1157
01:45:39,490 --> 01:45:41,870
I saw my dad.

1158
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,620
What?

1159
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:45,370
He sent the dementors away.

1160
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:46,960
I saw him across the lake.

1161
01:45:47,130 --> 01:45:48,790
Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1162
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,840
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1163
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:54,510
- You mean they're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1164
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,550
Much worse.

1165
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:59,100
They're going to suck out his soul.

1166
01:46:00,810 --> 01:46:02,180
Headmaster, you got to stop them.

1167
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:05,730
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true Sir. Sirius is innocent.

1168
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:08,110
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1169
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:09,650
He's my rat, sir.

1170
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:13,860
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1171
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:17,740
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

1172
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:20,450
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

1173
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:26,080
But im sorry to say the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1174
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:31,960
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1175
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:35,880
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1176
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:43,640
Mysterious thing, time.

1177
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:46,140
Powerful...

1178
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:49,190
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1179
01:46:50,770 --> 01:46:54,400
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1180
01:46:55,190 --> 01:46:57,320
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1181
01:46:57,490 --> 01:46:59,280
You must not be seen.

1182
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:03,120
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1183
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:06,830
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1184
01:47:07,370 --> 01:47:09,170
If you succeed tonight...

1185
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:12,170
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1186
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:16,220
Three turns should do it, I think.

1187
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,930
Oh, and by the way.

1188
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:28,940
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1189
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:31,190
Good luck.

1190
01:47:31,690 --> 01:47:34,150
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1191
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:37,150
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

1192
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:07,770
What just happened?

1193
01:48:07,930 --> 01:48:10,230
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1194
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:12,270
Where were we at 7:30?

1195
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:14,230
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1196
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,780
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1197
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:19,700
Hermione!

1198
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:40,550
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1199
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:45,930
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1200
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:48,980
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1201
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:50,480
That's us.

1202
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:53,600
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1203
01:48:53,810 --> 01:48:55,270
This is not normal.

1204
01:48:57,570 --> 01:48:59,940
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1205
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:02,320
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1206
01:49:02,490 --> 01:49:05,830
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1207
01:49:06,030 --> 01:49:09,250
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1208
01:49:09,410 --> 01:49:12,790
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1209
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:18,250
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1210
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,720
Good punch.

1211
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,390
Thanks.

1212
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:27,050
Malfoy's coming.

1213
01:49:27,970 --> 01:49:30,310
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1214
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:33,850
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1215
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:37,940
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1216
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,900
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1217
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:03,590
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1218
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,930
Of course.

1219
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:09,100
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1220
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:13,310
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1221
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,020
Let's go.

1222
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:38,420
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1223
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:41,090
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1224
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:43,710
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1225
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:47,130
Scabbers, you're alive!

1226
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:50,100
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1227
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:53,220
- Harry, you can't.
- Hermoine, He betrayed my parents.

1228
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:56,390
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1229
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:02,980
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1230
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:05,990
If you just go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1231
01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:09,030
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time, Harry.

1232
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:11,450
We can't be seen.

1233
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:16,460
Fudge is coming.

1234
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:19,460
And we aren't leaving?

1235
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:23,210
Why aren't we leaving?

1236
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:35,680
Are you mad?

1237
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:43,070
That hurt.

1238
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:44,610
Sorry.

1239
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:08,130
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1240
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,360
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1241
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:31,740
What?

1242
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:34,450
I thought I just saw...

1243
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:37,330
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1244
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:53,930
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1245
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:02,140
Get away. Get off.

1246
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:27,750
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1247
01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:31,760
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

1248
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:35,760
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1249
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:42,940
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1250
01:53:45,310 --> 01:53:49,110
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1251
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:53,240
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...

1252
01:53:53,610 --> 01:53:55,320
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1253
01:53:58,030 --> 01:54:01,000
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1254
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,500
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1255
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:10,630
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1256
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:12,510
- Now, look there.
- Where?

1257
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:16,090
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

1258
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:19,760
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1259
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:22,770
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

1260
01:54:23,730 --> 01:54:26,600
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

1261
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:27,940
- Over there.
- Where?

1262
01:54:28,110 --> 01:54:29,860
- Over there.
- This way.

1263
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:32,740
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

1264
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,110
But where is it?

1265
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:39,240
I saw the beast, just now.

1266
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:42,080
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

1267
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:43,580
Buckbeak.

1268
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:47,880
Oh c ome now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1269
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:49,380
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1270
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:53,840
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this. Hagrid

1271
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:56,880
After all how could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1272
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:58,930
- Right.
- Well, well.

1273
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:00,640
We must search the grounds.

1274
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:03,850
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1275
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:09,440
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1276
01:55:09,610 --> 01:55:13,610
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1277
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:15,650
Thank you.

1278
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:19,160
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1279
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,420
- Come on.
- This way.

1280
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:40,010
This way, now.

1281
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:44,180
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1282
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:46,890
- How?
- No idea.

1283
01:55:56,190 --> 01:55:58,570
- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!

1284
01:56:04,990 --> 01:56:07,000
And Snape's coming.

1285
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:14,880
And now we wait.

1286
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:17,880
And now we wait.

1287
01:56:45,450 --> 01:56:48,700
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

1288
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,290
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1289
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:57,800
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1290
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:00,090
...I did see someone.

1291
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:03,680
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1292
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:05,180
With a Patronus.

1293
01:57:05,350 --> 01:57:07,270
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1294
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:08,890
According to him...

1295
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:12,480
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1296
01:57:12,650 --> 01:57:14,520
It was my dad.

1297
01:57:15,650 --> 01:57:17,440
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1298
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:19,860
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

1299
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,610
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1300
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:29,370
Here we come.

1301
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,420
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1302
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:40,420
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.

1303
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:43,930
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1304
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:45,720
It'll just be me and him.

1305
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:48,350
We could live in the country...

1306
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:51,140
...someplace you can see the sky.

1307
01:57:51,310 --> 01:57:54,150
I think he'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1308
01:57:55,190 --> 01:57:56,730
Harry!

1309
01:57:58,270 --> 01:57:59,980
Run!

1310
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:08,410
Let's go.

1311
01:58:27,970 --> 01:58:30,310
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1312
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:35,940
Thanks.

1313
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:41,820
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1314
01:59:56,930 --> 01:59:58,690
That was so scary.

1315
01:59:58,850 --> 02:00:01,810
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1316
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:16,370
Sirius. Come on!

1317
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:34,510
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1318
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:37,890
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1319
02:00:46,610 --> 02:00:48,440
Any minute now.

1320
02:00:48,650 --> 02:00:50,700
Right there. You'll see.

1321
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:54,580
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1322
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:57,290
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1323
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:03,880
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

1324
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,800
...both of you.

1325
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:11,590
Harry!

1326
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:17,390
Expecto Patronum!

1327
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:17,580
You were right, Hermione.

1328
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:21,080
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1329
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:24,000
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1330
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:26,540
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1331
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:28,420
...well, I had already done it.

1332
02:02:28,590 --> 02:02:31,050
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1333
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:34,050
But I don't like flying...!

1334
02:02:47,190 --> 02:02:48,520
Bombarda!

1335
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:24,640
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1336
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:26,140
...to both of you.

1337
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:29,230
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1338
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:32,320
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1339
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,240
And besides...

1340
02:03:35,150 --> 02:03:38,450
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

1341
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:40,740
And you know it.

1342
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:43,700
And for now, that will do.

1343
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:48,580
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1344
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:52,130
...but you look so like your father.

1345
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:55,840
Except your eyes.

1346
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,090
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

1347
02:04:01,050 --> 02:04:06,140
It's cruel that I got to spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1348
02:04:06,730 --> 02:04:08,230
But know this:

1349
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:12,520
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1350
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:15,860
And you can always find them...

1351
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:20,110
...in here.

1352
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:33,040
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1353
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:01,490
We have to go.

1354
02:05:29,770 --> 02:05:32,440
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1355
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:34,150
Did what?

1356
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:36,270
Good night.

1357
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:46,370
How did you get there?

1358
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:49,200
I mean i was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1359
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:52,160
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

1360
02:05:52,330 --> 02:05:55,880
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1361
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:23,860
Hello, Harry.

1362
02:06:27,490 --> 02:06:29,330
I saw you coming.

1363
02:06:33,870 --> 02:06:36,580
I've looked worse, believe me.

1364
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:42,470
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1365
02:06:42,630 --> 02:06:45,590
No. I resigned, actually.

1366
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,550
Resigned? Why?

1367
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:53,020
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1368
02:06:53,180 --> 02:06:58,690
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1369
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:02,240
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1370
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:04,360
- But Dumbledore...
- Dumbledore has already...

1371
02:07:04,530 --> 02:07:06,410
...risked enough on my behalf.

1372
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:09,830
Besides, people like me are...

1373
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:13,790
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1374
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:25,930
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1375
02:07:26,090 --> 02:07:28,260
None of it made any difference.

1376
02:07:28,430 --> 02:07:31,970
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

1377
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:35,640
Harry, It made all the difference in the world.
You helped uncovered the truth.

1378
02:07:35,810 --> 02:07:38,310
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1379
02:07:38,690 --> 02:07:41,190
It made a great deal of difference.

1380
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:48,030
If I am proud of anything...

1381
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:50,870
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1382
02:07:51,030 --> 02:07:53,790
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1383
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:58,210
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1384
02:07:59,130 --> 02:08:01,630
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1385
02:08:01,790 --> 02:08:04,380
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1386
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:06,260
Until then...

1387
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:09,300
...mischief managed.

1388
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:47,760
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1389
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:49,340
Harry.

1390
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:51,550
Wherever did you get it?

1391
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:54,140
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1392
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:56,470
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1393
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:59,940
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1394
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:02,610
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1395
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:04,270
Did not.

1396
02:09:05,650 --> 02:09:09,150
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

1397
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:10,860
For me?

1398
02:09:11,030 --> 02:09:13,570
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1399
02:09:13,740 --> 02:09:15,660
This came with it.

1400
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,170
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

1401
02:09:22,330 --> 02:09:24,170
How fast is it, Harry?

1402
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:45,150
Lumos.

1403
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:47,730
I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.

1404
02:21:06,910 --> 02:21:08,710
Mischief managed.

1405
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:15,920
Nox.....


1
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:49,957
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,600
How fastidious you've become, Wormtail.

3
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,051
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:50,166
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,285
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,306
I only meant...

7
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:57,907
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:57,992 --> 00:03:00,611
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:04,236
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,081
Exactly as I said.

11
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:09,293
I will not disappoint you, my Lord.

12
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:10,868
Good.

13
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:14,088
First, gather our old comrades.

14
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:15,874
Send them a sign.

15
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:31,937
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

16
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:35,046
...is standing just outside the door.

17
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:40,944
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

18
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,228
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

19
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,184
Harry.

20
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:51,634
Harry!

21
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,563
Are you all right?

22
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:57,778
Hermione. Bad dream.

23
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,985
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

24
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,958
Last night.

25
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,113
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

26
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:06,599
Bloody hell.

27
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,513
Honestly, get dressed.

28
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:10,958
And don't go back to sleep.

29
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,533
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

30
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,686
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

31
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:27,728
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

32
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:28,848
Keep up!

33
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,431
Arthur!

34
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:36,035
It's about time, son.

35
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,213
Sorry, Amos.

36
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,973
Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start.

37
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:43,103
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.

38
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:45,586
Works with me at the Ministry.

39
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,210
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

40
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:50,246
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:51,793
This way.

42
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,503
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

43
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,493
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

44
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:01,871
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

45
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,707
Yes, it's just over there.

46
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:11,082
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

47
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:13,023
We don't want to be late.

48
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:16,678
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

49
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,531
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

50
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:23,230
- That isn't just any manky old boot, mate.
- It's a Portkey.

51
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:24,245
Time to go!

52
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:26,318
What's a Portkey?

53
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:31,095
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

54
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,260
...three!

55
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:44,108
Let go, kids!

56
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,487
- What?
- Let go!

57
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,608
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

58
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:05,089
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

59
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:12,564
Go on, look at that!

60
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:17,155
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

61
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:23,408
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

62
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:26,114
Look!

63
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,475
Come on! Keep up, girls!

64
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:37,408
Blimey!

65
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:39,776
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

66
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,265
- See you at the match.
- See you.

67
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,103
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

68
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:44,391
See you later, Cedric.

69
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:50,618
Home sweet home.

70
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:54,098
What?

71
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:04,113
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

72
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:05,613
- All to the bath.
- Look.

73
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:07,840
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

74
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:11,368
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

75
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:13,871
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

76
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:15,734
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

77
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,142
I love magic.

78
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:38,170
Get your Quidditch World Cup programs here!

79
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,297
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

80
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:43,537
Well, put it this way,

81
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:45,106
If it rains...

82
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:47,432
...you'll be the first to know.

83
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:50,914
Father and I are in the minister's box...

84
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,693
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

85
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:56,525
Don't boast, Draco.

86
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,139
There's no need with these people.

87
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:04,253
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

88
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,749
While you can.

89
00:08:19,903 --> 00:08:22,022
Come on up. Take your seats.

90
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:24,208
I told you these seats would
be worth waiting for.

91
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,815
Come on!

92
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,650
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

93
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,428
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

94
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:41,383
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

95
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:48,414
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

96
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:56,263
Who's that?

97
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,564
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

98
00:09:02,103 --> 00:09:05,653
Krum! Krum! Krum!

99
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:10,318
Krum! Krum! Krum!

100
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:11,613
Krum!

101
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,156
Yes!

102
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:23,099
Good evening!

103
00:09:23,657 --> 00:09:26,202
As Minister for Magic...

104
00:09:26,923 --> 00:09:29,963
...it gives me great pleasure...

105
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:33,995
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

106
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:39,470
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

107
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:42,470
Let the match...

108
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:43,959
...begin!

109
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:52,653
Krum! Krum! Krum!

110
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:02,163
There's no one like Krum.

111
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:03,941
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

112
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:06,470
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

113
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:10,338
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

114
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:11,605
He's an artist.

115
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,960
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

116
00:10:14,242 --> 00:10:15,803
<i>Viktor, I love you</i>

117
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:17,518
<i>Viktor, I do</i>

118
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:21,181
<i>When we're apart
My heart beats only for you</i>

119
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,509
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

120
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:25,190
Stop! Stop it!

121
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:27,553
It's not the Irish.

122
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,978
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

123
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,841
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

124
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,718
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

125
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:42,048
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

126
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:43,623
Go!

127
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:45,581
Harry!

128
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:03,313
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

129
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,866
Harry! Harry!

130
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:55,863
<i>Morsmordre!</i>

131
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:24,093
Harry!

132
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:28,813
- Where are you?
- Harry!

133
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,909
We've been looking for you for ages!

134
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:35,329
Thought we lost you, mate.

135
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:37,812
What is that?

136
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,126
Stupefy!

137
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:45,142
Stop!

138
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:46,881
That's my son!

139
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:51,363
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

140
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:52,748
Which of you conjured it?

141
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,849
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

142
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,173
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

143
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:59,468
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

144
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:00,855
What crime?

145
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:03,355
It's the Dark Mark, Harry.
It's his mark.

146
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,191
What, Voldemort?

147
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:10,188
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

148
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:11,695
- His followers?
- Yeah.

149
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:13,751
Death Eaters.

150
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:18,463
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

151
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:20,767
There!

152
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:23,060
All of you, this way!

153
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:25,544
A man, Harry?

154
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:27,228
Who?

155
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:29,191
I don't know.

156
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:33,022
I didn't see his face.

157
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:52,085
Anything from the trolley?

158
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,211
Anything from the trolley?

159
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,858
Anything from the trolley, dears?

160
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,297
Packet of Drooble's...

161
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:06,433
...and a Licorice Wand.

162
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:10,748
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

163
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,082
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

164
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,941
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

165
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:25,018
Thank you.

166
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,705
Anything sweet for you, dear?

167
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:30,749
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

168
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,518
Anything from the trolley?

169
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:35,776
This is horrible.

170
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:39,305
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

171
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:41,778
Wasn't there any security or...?

172
00:14:41,863 --> 00:14:43,878
Loads, according to Dad.

173
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,032
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

174
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:53,852
It's hurting again, isn't it?
Your scar.

175
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:55,942
I'm fine.

176
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:00,834
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

177
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:04,901
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

178
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:16,500
Hedwig. There we go.

179
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,028
Clear the runway!

180
00:16:04,273 --> 00:16:06,298
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

181
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:35,350
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

182
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,878
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

183
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,985
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

184
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:46,603
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

185
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:48,836
Yes, what is it?

186
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:50,288
What is it?

187
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,749
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

188
00:16:56,533 --> 00:17:02,300
So, Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event.

189
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:04,713
The Triwizard Tournament.

190
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:07,303
- Now, for those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

191
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:10,586
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

192
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,987
...for a series of magical contests.

193
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:16,452
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

194
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,441
Now let me be clear.

195
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,498
If chosen, you stand alone.

196
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:23,747
And trust me when I say...

197
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:26,405
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

198
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:28,749
But more of that later.

199
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:31,607
For now, please join me in welcoming...

200
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:35,677
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

201
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:39,021
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

202
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:53,700
Bloody hell.

203
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:04,183
Blimey. That's one big woman.

204
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:28,217
And now our friends from the north.

205
00:18:28,302 --> 00:18:31,152
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

206
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:34,027
...and their high master,
Igor Karkaroff.

207
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:58,588
Oh, it's Krum!

208
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,308
Blimey, it's him!

209
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:01,795
Viktor Krum!

210
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:12,923
Albus.

211
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:13,986
Igor.

212
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:32,154
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

213
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:34,686
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

214
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,684
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

215
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:40,731
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

216
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:43,743
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

217
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,954
You idiot!

218
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:58,348
Your attention, please!

219
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:02,783
I'd like to say a few words.

220
00:20:04,973 --> 00:20:06,708
Eternal glory.

221
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:11,135
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

222
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,426
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

223
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:20,135
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

224
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:21,608
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

225
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:25,332
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

226
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:27,488
To explain all this...

227
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:30,969
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

228
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:32,711
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

229
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:50,434
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

230
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:54,501
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

231
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,211
Dark-wizard catcher.

232
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,477
Half the cells in Azkaban
are filled thanks to him.

233
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:01,442
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

234
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,107
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

235
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:19,007
Thank you.

236
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:27,303
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

237
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:29,977
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

238
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:39,366
After due consideration...

239
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:42,709
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

240
00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:45,825
...no student under the age of 17...

241
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,565
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

242
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,222
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

243
00:21:52,307 --> 00:21:54,992
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

244
00:21:55,423 --> 00:21:58,495
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

245
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,250
The Goblet of Fire.

246
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:24,388
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

247
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,354
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

248
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:30,903
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

249
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:33,964
Do not do so lightly.

250
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:37,411
If chosen, there's no turning back.

251
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:42,442
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

252
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:10,681
Alastor Moody.

253
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:14,691
Ex-Auror...

254
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:18,356
...Ministry malcontent...

255
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:21,958
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

256
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:25,733
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

257
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:27,646
Any questions?

258
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,343
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

259
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:36,598
...I believe in a practical approach.

260
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:42,577
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

261
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:45,970
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

262
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:47,751
Because they are unforgivable.

263
00:23:48,214 --> 00:23:49,608
The use of any one of them will...

264
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:53,674
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

265
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,750
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

266
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,017
I say different!

267
00:23:58,465 --> 00:24:00,421
You need to know what you're up against!

268
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,075
You need to be prepared.

269
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:04,761
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

270
00:24:04,846 --> 00:24:07,122
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

271
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:08,409
No way.

272
00:24:08,737 --> 00:24:10,564
The old codger can see out
the back of his head.

273
00:24:11,673 --> 00:24:13,423
And hear across classrooms!

274
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:18,640
So, which curse shall we see first?

275
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,475
- Weasley!
- Yes?

276
00:24:20,663 --> 00:24:21,610
Stand.

277
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:26,422
Give us a curse.

278
00:24:27,313 --> 00:24:31,198
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

279
00:24:31,783 --> 00:24:33,107
The Imperius Curse.

280
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:36,442
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

281
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:39,465
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

282
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:42,493
Perhaps this will show you why.

283
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,110
Hello.

284
00:24:52,982 --> 00:24:54,546
Lovely little beauty.

285
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,123
<i>Engorgio.</i>

286
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:01,519
<i>Imperio!</i>

287
00:25:06,353 --> 00:25:08,119
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

288
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:16,073
If she bites...

289
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:18,226
...she's lethal.

290
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:22,557
What are you laughing at?

291
00:25:24,294 --> 00:25:25,262
Get off!

292
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:29,475
Talented, isn't she?

293
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,529
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

294
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,474
Drown herself?

295
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,937
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

296
00:25:52,022 --> 00:25:55,266
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

297
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,648
...under the influence
of the Imperius Curse.

298
00:25:58,733 --> 00:25:59,827
But here's the rub...

299
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,521
How do we sort out the liars?

300
00:26:06,323 --> 00:26:07,405
Another, another.

301
00:26:08,956 --> 00:26:10,050
Up, up. Come on.

302
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:11,726
Longbottom, is it?

303
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:13,799
Up.

304
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:20,303
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

305
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:23,459
There's the...

306
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:26,134
The Cruciatus Curse.

307
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:28,583
Correct, correct. Come, come.

308
00:26:29,313 --> 00:26:30,556
Particularly nasty.

309
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,469
The torture curse.

310
00:26:36,813 --> 00:26:38,548
<i>Crucio!</i>

311
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:52,661
Stop it!

312
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:55,031
Can't you see it's bothering him?
Stop it!

313
00:27:13,224 --> 00:27:16,481
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

314
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:20,264
No?

315
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:23,087
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

316
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:29,205
The Killing Curse.

317
00:27:30,663 --> 00:27:32,966
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

318
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:35,832
...and he's sitting in this room.

319
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:09,597
Brilliant, isn't he?

320
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:11,873
Completely demented, of course,

321
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,333
and terrifying to be in
the same room with...

322
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:15,957
...but he's really been there, you know?

323
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:17,605
He's looked evil in the eye.

324
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,172
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

325
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,090
To perform them in a classroom...

326
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:24,126
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

327
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:28,594
Neville?

328
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:30,122
Son?

329
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:32,022
You all right?

330
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:36,335
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

331
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:53,173
We're gonna be late!

332
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:08,991
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

333
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:27,405
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

334
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:30,233
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

335
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:31,824
Yeah, rather you than me.

336
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,484
Yes!

337
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:38,354
Thank you, thank you.

338
00:29:38,686 --> 00:29:41,551
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

339
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,503
It's not going to work.

340
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:47,013
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

341
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,623
You see this? This is an Age Line.

342
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:52,487
Dumbledore drew it himself.

343
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:53,698
So?

344
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:59,677
So, a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

345
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:02,779
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

346
00:30:02,864 --> 00:30:06,471
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

347
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:10,617
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

348
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,153
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

349
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:18,323
- Yes!
- Yes!

350
00:30:19,044 --> 00:30:20,038
Yeah!

351
00:30:21,674 --> 00:30:22,745
Yes!

352
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,741
Ready?

353
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:30,297
- Yes!
- Yes!

354
00:30:39,343 --> 00:30:40,786
- You said!
- You said!

355
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:45,725
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?
- I'll tear your ears off!

356
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,320
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

357
00:30:48,405 --> 00:30:51,293
Fight! Fight! Fight!

358
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:56,790
We're "old school," right?

359
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,407
Yeah, but you look older!

360
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:32,818
Sit down. Please.

361
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,999
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

362
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:41,525
The champion selection.

363
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:16,395
The Durmstrang champion is Viktor Krum.

364
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:35,003
The champion for Beauxbatons...

365
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,251
...is Fleur Delacour.

366
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:50,733
The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!

367
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,580
Excellent!

368
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:05,231
We now have our three champions.

369
00:33:05,945 --> 00:33:09,641
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

370
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:13,605
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

371
00:33:13,932 --> 00:33:16,192
...this vessel of victory...

372
00:33:16,968 --> 00:33:18,399
...the Triwizard Cup!

373
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:51,117
Harry Potter.

374
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:55,054
Harry Potter?

375
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,304
No. No.

376
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:03,988
Harry Potter!

377
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:05,128
Go on, Harry.

378
00:34:06,053 --> 00:34:07,163
Harry, for goodness sake.

379
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:40,526
He's a cheat!

380
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:43,070
He's not even 17 yet!

381
00:35:11,453 --> 00:35:14,994
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

382
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,150
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- Quiet! I can't think!

383
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:20,299
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

384
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,637
- Harry.
- I protest!

385
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:23,677
Harry, did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

386
00:35:23,762 --> 00:35:26,088
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

387
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:27,513
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

388
00:35:27,598 --> 00:35:30,087
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

389
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,224
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

390
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:35,815
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

391
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,973
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it.

392
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:41,108
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

393
00:35:41,193 --> 00:35:44,473
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

394
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:47,864
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff

395
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:49,357
perhaps you remember.

396
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:51,183
This doesn't help, Alastor.

397
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:54,258
Leave this to you, Barty.

398
00:35:56,493 --> 00:35:57,793
The rules are absolute.

399
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:03,070
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

400
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,746
Mr. Potter has no choice.

401
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:10,499
He is, as of tonight...

402
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:13,845
...a Triwizard champion.

403
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:43,850
This can't go on, Albus.

404
00:36:44,753 --> 00:36:47,175
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

405
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:49,083
What do you suggest, Minerva?

406
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:52,145
Put an end to it.

407
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,267
Don't let Potter compete.

408
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:57,764
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

409
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:01,253
Well, the devil with Barty and his rules.

410
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:03,673
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

411
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:07,828
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

412
00:37:07,913 --> 00:37:11,973
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

413
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:15,266
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

414
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:18,617
...let them unfold.

415
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:20,994
What...? Do nothing?

416
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:23,047
Offer him up as bait?

417
00:37:24,012 --> 00:37:26,899
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

418
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:28,793
I agree.

419
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,513
With Severus.

420
00:37:31,093 --> 00:37:33,509
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

421
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:36,489
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

422
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,997
He must be anxious enough as it is...

423
00:37:40,545 --> 00:37:42,177
...knowing what lies ahead.

424
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,729
Then again, we all are.

425
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:02,134
How did you do it?

426
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,620
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

427
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:09,002
Might've let
your best friend know, though.

428
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:12,067
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

429
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:14,980
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

430
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:16,372
Okay?

431
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:19,592
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

432
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,619
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

433
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:29,322
I didn't put my name in that cup.

434
00:38:29,563 --> 00:38:32,249
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

435
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:37,602
Look, I don't know
what happened tonight...

436
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:39,087
...and I don't know why.

437
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:41,018
It just did.

438
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:42,814
Okay?

439
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:53,400
Piss off.

440
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:11,153
What a charismatic quartet.

441
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:13,845
Hello.

442
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:17,524
I'm Rita Skeeter.

443
00:39:18,062 --> 00:39:20,572
I write for the "Daily Prophet".

444
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,028
But of course you know that, don't you?

445
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,743
It's you we don't know.

446
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,294
You're the juicy news.

447
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:32,815
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

448
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:36,757
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

449
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:40,052
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

450
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:42,801
In short, what makes a champion tick?

451
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,557
"Me, Myself and I" want to know.

452
00:39:45,642 --> 00:39:47,500
Not to mention my rabid readers.

453
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:50,210
So, who's feeling up to sharing?

454
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:56,372
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

455
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,905
This is cozy.

456
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,623
It's a broom cupboard.

457
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,854
You should feel right at home, then.

458
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,921
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

459
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:19,649
No.

460
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:22,081
So, tell me, Harry.

461
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,843
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

462
00:40:25,928 --> 00:40:27,496
I'm 14. Sorry.

463
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:30,643
About to compete
against three students...

464
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:34,040
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

465
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:36,853
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

466
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:38,746
...in your dizziest daydreams.

467
00:40:39,863 --> 00:40:41,089
Concerned?

468
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,846
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

469
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,298
Just ignore the quill.

470
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,953
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

471
00:40:51,038 --> 00:40:53,023
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

472
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:56,618
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

473
00:40:56,703 --> 00:40:59,987
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

474
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:01,794
No, I didn't enter.

475
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:03,048
Of course you didn't.

476
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:07,664
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

477
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:11,178
Scratch that last.

478
00:41:12,263 --> 00:41:14,662
Speaking of your parents,
were they alive...

479
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:16,483
...how do you think they'd feel?

480
00:41:16,568 --> 00:41:17,416
Proud?

481
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,563
Or concerned...

482
00:41:18,648 --> 00:41:22,204
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

483
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:24,499
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

484
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:30,397
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

485
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,968
<i>Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig.</i>

486
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,241
<i>Ever since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...</i>

487
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,119
<i>...and she's too easily recognized.</i>

488
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,511
<i>We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.</i>

489
00:42:14,913 --> 00:42:19,055
<i>Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.</i>

490
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,614
<i>And make sure you're alone.</i>

491
00:42:21,095 --> 00:42:22,113
<i>Sirius.</i>

492
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:24,147
<i>P. S.</i>

493
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:25,882
<i>The bird bites.</i>

494
00:42:36,683 --> 00:42:37,717
Sirius?

495
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:57,173
<i>Harry Potter, age 12...</i>

496
00:42:57,258 --> 00:43:00,043
<i>...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.</i>

497
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:02,493
<i>His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...</i>

498
00:43:02,578 --> 00:43:04,047
<i>...and choking back tears...</i>

499
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:22,532
Sirius. How...?

500
00:43:22,858 --> 00:43:25,505
I don't have much time, Harry,
so let me get straight to it.

501
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,285
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

502
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,308
No!

503
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:31,903
I had to ask.

504
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:34,716
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.

505
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,915
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

506
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,287
But who was the third man in the room?

507
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,075
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

508
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:43,917
No.

509
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:49,133
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

510
00:43:49,218 --> 00:43:50,518
And what was that?

511
00:43:52,628 --> 00:43:53,797
He wanted...

512
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:55,530
...me.

513
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:58,261
I don't know why.

514
00:43:58,346 --> 00:44:00,298
But he was gonna use this man
to get to me.

515
00:44:02,594 --> 00:44:04,517
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

516
00:44:04,856 --> 00:44:06,322
Yes.

517
00:44:06,705 --> 00:44:07,980
It's just a dream.

518
00:44:09,262 --> 00:44:10,285
Look, Harry.

519
00:44:10,855 --> 00:44:14,071
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

520
00:44:14,156 --> 00:44:15,557
...these are not just coincidences.

521
00:44:15,642 --> 00:44:17,892
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

522
00:44:18,493 --> 00:44:19,573
What are you saying?

523
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:22,697
I'm saying the devils
are inside the walls.

524
00:44:22,782 --> 00:44:24,143
Igor Karkaroff?

525
00:44:24,232 --> 00:44:25,366
He was a Death Eater.

526
00:44:25,648 --> 00:44:28,878
And no one, no one stops
being a Death Eater.

527
00:44:28,963 --> 00:44:31,478
Then there's Barty Crouch.
Heart of stone.

528
00:44:31,563 --> 00:44:33,862
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

529
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,990
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

530
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:43,276
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet, Harry...

531
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,187
...but whoever did is no friend to you.

532
00:44:45,272 --> 00:44:47,669
People die in this tournament.

533
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:50,834
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

534
00:44:54,863 --> 00:44:57,109
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

535
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:02,512
- Who were you talking to?
- What?

536
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:05,036
- Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

537
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:06,814
Maybe you're imagining things.

538
00:45:07,687 --> 00:45:08,873
Wouldn't be the first time.

539
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,525
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

540
00:45:39,243 --> 00:45:40,236
Amazing.

541
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,969
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

542
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:48,062
Right, sorry.

543
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:52,218
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

544
00:45:52,473 --> 00:45:55,112
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

545
00:45:57,412 --> 00:45:58,929
It's already been through enough people.

546
00:45:59,014 --> 00:46:01,101
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

547
00:46:02,562 --> 00:46:05,025
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

548
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,625
What do you want me to say again?

549
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:08,313
Go.

550
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:15,846
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

551
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:20,148
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

552
00:46:20,233 --> 00:46:22,189
Is that right? Well...

553
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:23,752
What?

554
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:30,955
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

555
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:37,378
Dean was told by Parvati that...

556
00:46:39,098 --> 00:46:40,768
Please don't ask me to say it again.

557
00:46:41,553 --> 00:46:43,030
Hagrid's looking for you.

558
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:46,040
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

559
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,264
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

560
00:46:59,446 --> 00:47:02,148
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

561
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:03,399
You'll see soon enough.

562
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,472
Now pay attention, this is important.

563
00:47:07,823 --> 00:47:08,957
What's with the flower?

564
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:12,125
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

565
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:14,362
As a matter of fact, I have.

566
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,377
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

567
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:28,045
Hagrid?

568
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:33,667
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

569
00:47:40,563 --> 00:47:41,755
<i>Bonsoir</i>, Olympe.

570
00:47:42,414 --> 00:47:43,692
Oh, Hagrid.

571
00:47:44,238 --> 00:47:46,093
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.

572
00:47:46,704 --> 00:47:50,003
I thought perhaps you had forgotten me.

573
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,710
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

574
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,321
What is it you wanted to show me?

575
00:47:57,003 --> 00:47:59,667
When we spoke earlier, you sounded so...

576
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:01,851
...exhilarated.

577
00:48:02,725 --> 00:48:04,800
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

578
00:48:15,952 --> 00:48:17,309
Can we get closer?

579
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:26,627
Dragons?

580
00:48:27,299 --> 00:48:28,863
That's the first task?

581
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:31,284
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

582
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,016
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

583
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,736
Oh, crikey!

584
00:48:38,228 --> 00:48:40,692
Although, I have to admit...

585
00:48:40,777 --> 00:48:43,288
...that Horntail is a right nasty
piece of work.

586
00:48:43,994 --> 00:48:46,399
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

587
00:48:48,213 --> 00:48:50,300
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

588
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:53,454
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

589
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:55,513
Didn't Ron tell you that?

590
00:48:57,473 --> 00:48:58,467
No, he didn't.

591
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:00,792
He didn't tell me a thing.

592
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:13,994
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

593
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,519
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

594
00:49:18,604 --> 00:49:21,090
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

595
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,633
Like the badge?

596
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:26,037
Excuse me.

597
00:49:30,644 --> 00:49:31,690
Harry.

598
00:49:32,897 --> 00:49:34,817
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

599
00:49:34,902 --> 00:49:35,858
Can I have a word?

600
00:49:37,393 --> 00:49:39,877
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

601
00:49:39,962 --> 00:49:42,038
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

602
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:47,210
Dragons. That's the first task.

603
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:50,303
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

604
00:49:50,983 --> 00:49:52,359
Are you serious?

605
00:49:53,686 --> 00:49:57,061
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

606
00:49:57,146 --> 00:49:59,274
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

607
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,879
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

608
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,258
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

609
00:50:03,812 --> 00:50:05,889
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

610
00:50:06,923 --> 00:50:09,376
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

611
00:50:10,128 --> 00:50:11,588
It just happens a fair bit.

612
00:50:11,673 --> 00:50:14,099
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

613
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:16,628
You're a right foul git, you know that?

614
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:18,549
- You think so?
- I know so.

615
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:20,427
Anything else?

616
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,510
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

617
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:29,724
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

618
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:33,008
My father and I have a bet, you see.

619
00:50:33,693 --> 00:50:36,202
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

620
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,603
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

621
00:50:42,688 --> 00:50:45,764
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

622
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:49,989
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

623
00:50:51,696 --> 00:50:53,666
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

624
00:50:56,343 --> 00:50:58,520
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

625
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:03,248
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

626
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,013
- Professor Moody!
- ...back-shooting...

627
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:06,475
What are you doing?

628
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,153
Teaching.

629
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:12,741
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

630
00:51:19,348 --> 00:51:20,631
Stand still! Stand still!

631
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,218
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

632
00:51:34,303 --> 00:51:36,318
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

633
00:51:36,403 --> 00:51:37,416
Professor!

634
00:51:38,354 --> 00:51:42,098
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair boy!

635
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:44,537
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

636
00:51:45,174 --> 00:51:48,904
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

637
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:50,819
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

638
00:51:51,773 --> 00:51:52,986
He might've mentioned it.

639
00:51:53,252 --> 00:51:55,769
Well, you will do well to remember it.

640
00:51:57,243 --> 00:51:58,131
Away!

641
00:52:01,913 --> 00:52:03,630
You. Come with me.

642
00:52:39,283 --> 00:52:40,965
That's a Foe-Glass.

643
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,914
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

644
00:52:44,842 --> 00:52:48,298
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

645
00:52:53,582 --> 00:52:55,383
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

646
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,899
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

647
00:52:58,123 --> 00:52:59,043
Now...

648
00:53:01,593 --> 00:53:03,617
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

649
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:09,913
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

650
00:53:12,103 --> 00:53:12,961
Sit.

651
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,726
Listen to me, Potter.

652
00:53:19,778 --> 00:53:20,990
Your pal Diggory?

653
00:53:21,277 --> 00:53:25,114
By your age, he could turn a whistle into
a watch and have it sing you the time.

654
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:27,913
Miss Delacour?

655
00:53:28,323 --> 00:53:30,988
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

656
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:35,017
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

657
00:53:35,293 --> 00:53:37,072
...but Karkaroff's is not.

658
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:38,756
They'll have a strategy.

659
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:43,104
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

660
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,109
Come on, Potter.

661
00:53:49,748 --> 00:53:50,981
What are your strengths?

662
00:53:53,306 --> 00:53:54,346
I don't know.

663
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:57,439
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

664
00:53:57,799 --> 00:53:59,287
Better than fair, the way I heard it.

665
00:53:59,832 --> 00:54:01,153
But I'm not allowed a broom.

666
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:05,117
You're allowed a wand.

667
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,477
Bets! Place your bets!

668
00:54:13,562 --> 00:54:15,998
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

669
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:19,097
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

670
00:54:19,182 --> 00:54:21,497
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

671
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:23,235
Yes, sir?

672
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:26,431
Ten-to-one for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

673
00:54:27,303 --> 00:54:28,894
Your attention, please.

674
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,789
This is a great day for all of us.

675
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:39,323
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

676
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,338
Please keep your seats at all times.

677
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:45,587
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

678
00:54:45,672 --> 00:54:48,435
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

679
00:54:49,283 --> 00:54:51,078
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

680
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,919
- How are you feeling? Okay?
- ...the greatest of luck.

681
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,885
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

682
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,047
Battle a dragon.

683
00:55:06,184 --> 00:55:08,464
Young love.

684
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:10,585
How...

685
00:55:13,183 --> 00:55:14,213
...stirring.

686
00:55:17,143 --> 00:55:20,311
If everything goes unfortunately today...

687
00:55:20,396 --> 00:55:22,620
...you two may even
make the front page.

688
00:55:23,443 --> 00:55:25,570
You have no business here.

689
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,910
This tent is for champions...

690
00:55:28,193 --> 00:55:29,534
...and friends.

691
00:55:32,703 --> 00:55:36,648
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

692
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,833
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

693
00:55:42,918 --> 00:55:47,163
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

694
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:50,457
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

695
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:52,039
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

696
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:55,891
Sorry, I'll just go.

697
00:55:55,976 --> 00:55:57,324
Barty, the bag.

698
00:55:57,959 --> 00:55:59,857
Champions, in a circle around me.

699
00:56:00,258 --> 00:56:02,790
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

700
00:56:03,645 --> 00:56:06,768
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

701
00:56:07,686 --> 00:56:09,638
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

702
00:56:14,243 --> 00:56:15,573
The Welsh Green.

703
00:56:20,527 --> 00:56:21,599
Mr. Krum.

704
00:56:24,873 --> 00:56:26,442
The Chinese Fireball.

705
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:35,101
The Swedish Short-Snout.

706
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,218
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

707
00:56:38,303 --> 00:56:40,002
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

708
00:56:43,912 --> 00:56:46,265
The Hungarian Horntail.

709
00:56:48,563 --> 00:56:51,693
These represent four very real dragons...

710
00:56:51,778 --> 00:56:54,906
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

711
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:56,760
Your objective is simple.

712
00:56:57,485 --> 00:56:58,732
Collect the egg.

713
00:56:59,498 --> 00:57:02,498
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

714
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:05,555
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

715
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:07,235
Any questions?

716
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:11,291
Very well. Good luck, champions.

717
00:57:11,376 --> 00:57:13,538
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

718
00:57:22,893 --> 00:57:26,733
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

719
00:57:38,283 --> 00:57:41,194
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

720
00:57:41,706 --> 00:57:44,998
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

721
00:57:45,472 --> 00:57:48,660
And now our fourth and final contestant.

722
00:57:50,963 --> 00:57:54,553
Harry! Harry! Harry!

723
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,680
Harry! Harry! Harry!

724
00:59:01,653 --> 00:59:04,681
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

725
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:06,620
<i>Accio</i> Firebolt!

726
00:59:36,113 --> 00:59:38,273
- Yeah!
- Yes!

727
00:59:47,138 --> 00:59:48,161
Oh, my.

728
00:59:58,253 --> 01:00:01,616
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

729
01:02:33,573 --> 01:02:35,204
Yes! Yes!

730
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:57,325
Yes, Harry!

731
01:02:58,933 --> 01:03:01,726
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.

732
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,696
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

733
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,827
- Never!
- Never!

734
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:08,685
Shush!

735
01:03:09,555 --> 01:03:11,666
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

736
01:03:13,283 --> 01:03:16,162
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

737
01:03:16,896 --> 01:03:20,222
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

738
01:03:30,688 --> 01:03:32,451
What the bloody hell was that?

739
01:03:37,183 --> 01:03:39,692
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

740
01:03:40,103 --> 01:03:43,161
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

741
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,774
I reckon you have to be barking mad to
put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

742
01:03:51,653 --> 01:03:54,330
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

743
01:03:55,702 --> 01:03:57,214
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

744
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,489
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

745
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,751
Brilliant.
That makes me feel loads better.

746
01:04:06,506 --> 01:04:08,106
Least I warned you about the dragons.

747
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,877
Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

748
01:04:09,963 --> 01:04:11,463
No, no, no, I did.

749
01:04:11,633 --> 01:04:12,992
No, don't you remember?

750
01:04:13,464 --> 01:04:14,757
I told Hermione to tell you...

751
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:17,918
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

752
01:04:18,968 --> 01:04:22,352
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

753
01:04:24,023 --> 01:04:26,487
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

754
01:04:27,319 --> 01:04:28,564
...after you'd figured that out.

755
01:04:29,406 --> 01:04:31,696
Who...?
Who could possibly figure that out?

756
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:34,346
That's completely mental.

757
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:36,727
Yeah. Isn't it?

758
01:04:37,743 --> 01:04:39,320
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

759
01:04:42,373 --> 01:04:43,359
Boys.

760
01:05:08,523 --> 01:05:09,585
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

761
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,688
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

762
01:05:20,153 --> 01:05:21,236
Shush.

763
01:05:22,488 --> 01:05:23,742
Look at this!

764
01:05:26,106 --> 01:05:27,808
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

765
01:05:29,528 --> 01:05:31,788
"Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl..."

766
01:05:31,873 --> 01:05:34,480
"...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards."

767
01:05:34,655 --> 01:05:36,949
"Her latest prey, sources report..."

768
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:40,306
"...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum."

769
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,524
"No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

770
01:05:46,473 --> 01:05:47,998
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

771
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:49,834
Thank you, Nigel.

772
01:05:54,887 --> 01:05:56,011
Not now, Nigel.

773
01:05:57,007 --> 01:05:57,912
Later.

774
01:05:59,525 --> 01:06:00,361
Go on.

775
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,679
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

776
01:06:11,413 --> 01:06:13,163
Oh, look, mom's sent me something.

777
01:06:21,382 --> 01:06:23,005
Mom sent me a dress.

778
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,460
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

779
01:06:27,603 --> 01:06:29,092
Nose down, Harry.

780
01:06:29,973 --> 01:06:33,598
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

781
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:36,778
What are you on about?

782
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,090
They're not for Ginny.

783
01:06:39,459 --> 01:06:40,574
They're for you.

784
01:06:42,216 --> 01:06:45,507
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

785
01:06:47,122 --> 01:06:48,605
The Yule Ball...

786
01:06:49,493 --> 01:06:54,208
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

787
01:06:55,543 --> 01:06:57,203
...since its inception.

788
01:06:58,293 --> 01:07:01,942
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

789
01:07:02,343 --> 01:07:03,926
...gather in the Great Hall...

790
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:07,918
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

791
01:07:09,763 --> 01:07:12,098
As representatives of the host school...

792
01:07:12,183 --> 01:07:17,465
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

793
01:07:17,692 --> 01:07:19,949
And I mean this literally, because...

794
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:24,707
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

795
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:26,984
...a dance.

796
01:07:31,453 --> 01:07:32,685
Silence!

797
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:36,538
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

798
01:07:36,623 --> 01:07:39,132
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

799
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:43,357
I will not have you, in the course of a
single evening, besmirching that name...

800
01:07:43,442 --> 01:07:47,401
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

801
01:07:48,702 --> 01:07:50,638
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

802
01:07:50,723 --> 01:07:52,082
Now, to dance...

803
01:07:52,306 --> 01:07:55,332
...is to let the body breathe.

804
01:07:56,235 --> 01:07:59,663
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

805
01:07:59,748 --> 01:08:02,190
...longing to burst forth
and take flight.

806
01:08:02,275 --> 01:08:04,136
Something's about to burst
out of Eloise Midgen,

807
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,716
but I don't think it's a swan.

808
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:09,662
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

809
01:08:09,747 --> 01:08:12,038
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

810
01:08:12,123 --> 01:08:13,860
Will you join me, please?

811
01:08:19,174 --> 01:08:22,756
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

812
01:08:22,972 --> 01:08:25,191
- Where?
- My waist.

813
01:08:25,554 --> 01:08:27,797
And extend your arm.

814
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,431
Mr. Filch, if you please.

815
01:08:33,723 --> 01:08:35,723
One, two, three.

816
01:08:35,808 --> 01:08:39,789
One, two, three. One, two, three.

817
01:08:43,175 --> 01:08:45,004
Never gonna let him forget this, are you?

818
01:08:45,368 --> 01:08:46,260
- Never.
- Never.

819
01:08:46,345 --> 01:08:50,173
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

820
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,719
Why do they have to travel in packs?

821
01:09:15,804 --> 01:09:17,690
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

822
01:09:26,313 --> 01:09:29,823
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

823
01:09:29,908 --> 01:09:31,632
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

824
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,815
I take after my mom.

825
01:09:40,163 --> 01:09:43,941
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

826
01:09:44,293 --> 01:09:46,261
No, not the maternal sort, her.

827
01:09:46,346 --> 01:09:50,049
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

828
01:09:50,194 --> 01:09:51,960
I could pick him up at the age of 6

829
01:09:52,045 --> 01:09:53,743
with one hand
and put him up on the dresser.

830
01:09:54,915 --> 01:09:56,650
He laughed so hard at that.

831
01:09:59,223 --> 01:10:00,299
Very funny.

832
01:10:07,023 --> 01:10:10,079
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

833
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:13,283
So, I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

834
01:10:14,403 --> 01:10:16,623
But enough of me. What about you?

835
01:10:33,913 --> 01:10:35,099
This is mad.

836
01:10:35,184 --> 01:10:37,039
At this rate, we'll be the
only ones in our year

837
01:10:37,124 --> 01:10:38,156
without dates.

838
01:10:40,977 --> 01:10:43,529
Well, us and Neville.

839
01:10:44,072 --> 01:10:46,135
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

840
01:10:47,582 --> 01:10:49,880
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

841
01:10:53,323 --> 01:10:55,118
Now, I'm really depressed.

842
01:11:00,913 --> 01:11:03,403
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

843
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:07,909
Who you going with, then?

844
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,843
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

845
01:11:12,928 --> 01:11:17,840
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

846
01:11:18,898 --> 01:11:20,019
To the ball?

847
01:11:20,553 --> 01:11:21,648
Yeah, all right.

848
01:11:25,707 --> 01:11:26,790
Oi, Hermione.

849
01:11:27,433 --> 01:11:28,369
You're a girl.

850
01:11:29,273 --> 01:11:30,435
Very well spotted.

851
01:11:30,725 --> 01:11:31,669
Come with one of us?

852
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,026
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

853
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,692
For a girl, it's just sad.

854
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:44,952
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

855
01:11:52,753 --> 01:11:54,245
And I said yes!

856
01:11:56,498 --> 01:11:57,801
Bloody hell.

857
01:11:58,267 --> 01:11:59,375
She's lying, right?

858
01:12:00,223 --> 01:12:01,388
If you say so.

859
01:12:02,143 --> 01:12:05,227
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

860
01:12:05,728 --> 01:12:07,605
Tonight, when we get back
to the common room...

861
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,496
...we'll both have partners. Agreed?

862
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,521
Agreed.

863
01:12:35,257 --> 01:12:36,683
- Cho!
- Harry!

864
01:12:40,598 --> 01:12:43,081
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

865
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,451
Okay, thanks.

866
01:12:49,473 --> 01:12:50,491
Cho?

867
01:12:51,483 --> 01:12:52,326
Yes?

868
01:12:54,393 --> 01:12:56,468
Well, I just wondered if you...

869
01:12:56,553 --> 01:12:58,741
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

870
01:13:01,283 --> 01:13:02,940
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

871
01:13:04,453 --> 01:13:08,958
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

872
01:13:15,373 --> 01:13:16,405
Harry...

873
01:13:17,133 --> 01:13:19,352
...I'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

874
01:13:20,794 --> 01:13:21,720
And...

875
01:13:23,053 --> 01:13:25,937
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

876
01:13:28,046 --> 01:13:30,541
Okay. Yeah. Great.

877
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:33,984
Fine. No problem.

878
01:13:34,893 --> 01:13:36,042
Okay. Good.

879
01:13:37,943 --> 01:13:38,799
Harry?

880
01:13:40,356 --> 01:13:41,316
I really am...

881
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,102
...sorry.

882
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:55,078
It's all right, Ron.

883
01:13:55,163 --> 01:13:57,723
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

884
01:13:58,469 --> 01:13:59,543
What happened to you?

885
01:14:00,673 --> 01:14:02,291
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

886
01:14:02,747 --> 01:14:03,660
What?

887
01:14:04,217 --> 01:14:05,232
What did she say?

888
01:14:05,673 --> 01:14:06,899
No, of course.

889
01:14:08,593 --> 01:14:11,431
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

890
01:14:12,298 --> 01:14:14,039
There she was, walking by.

891
01:14:14,849 --> 01:14:16,643
You know how I like it when they walk.

892
01:14:17,523 --> 01:14:20,601
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

893
01:14:21,369 --> 01:14:24,254
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

894
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:29,494
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

895
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,601
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

896
01:14:33,686 --> 01:14:34,774
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

897
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:37,727
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

898
01:14:39,463 --> 01:14:41,505
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

899
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:43,633
Hey!

900
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:02,005
Bloody hell.

901
01:15:04,704 --> 01:15:05,998
Bloody hell.

902
01:15:09,842 --> 01:15:10,676
Bloody...

903
01:15:11,238 --> 01:15:12,528
Oh, bloody...

904
01:15:16,357 --> 01:15:19,118
What are those? What are those?

905
01:15:19,203 --> 01:15:21,804
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

906
01:15:22,296 --> 01:15:24,790
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

907
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:27,532
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

908
01:15:27,617 --> 01:15:29,897
Traditional? They're ancient!

909
01:15:30,669 --> 01:15:32,327
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

910
01:15:35,178 --> 01:15:37,539
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

911
01:15:42,726 --> 01:15:44,179
Murder me, Harry.

912
01:15:45,952 --> 01:15:47,116
Leave it alone!

913
01:15:48,613 --> 01:15:49,786
Poor kid.

914
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:52,117
I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

915
01:15:52,203 --> 01:15:54,863
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

916
01:15:54,948 --> 01:15:58,248
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

917
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:00,587
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

918
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,223
Nobody asked her.

919
01:16:03,223 --> 01:16:05,960
Would've taken her myself if
she wasn't so bloody proud.

920
01:16:07,128 --> 01:16:08,274
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

921
01:16:08,688 --> 01:16:09,766
Don't you look...

922
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,124
...dashing.

923
01:16:12,888 --> 01:16:15,568
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

924
01:16:16,143 --> 01:16:18,238
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

925
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,136
It's traditional that
the three champions...

926
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:22,522
Well, in this case, four.
Are the first to dance.

927
01:16:22,733 --> 01:16:25,241
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

928
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:27,209
Well, now you know.

929
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:33,377
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

930
01:16:33,768 --> 01:16:35,982
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

931
01:16:36,067 --> 01:16:37,227
Come along this way.

932
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:44,114
Oh, come on.

933
01:16:45,253 --> 01:16:47,499
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

934
01:16:47,584 --> 01:16:48,965
...in the procession, please.

935
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,752
Oh, you are very late.

936
01:16:53,013 --> 01:16:55,089
This way. This way. Come along.

937
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:58,803
She looks beautiful!

938
01:16:59,556 --> 01:17:00,676
Yeah, she does.

939
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:51,512
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

940
01:17:52,693 --> 01:17:55,136
No. Absolutely not.

941
01:17:59,874 --> 01:18:00,799
Hi!

942
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:12,134
Harry, take my waist.

943
01:18:13,113 --> 01:18:14,180
- What?
- Now!

944
01:19:21,085 --> 01:19:22,821
Are you ready?

945
01:19:23,653 --> 01:19:26,070
<i>Move your body like a hairy troll</i>

946
01:19:26,703 --> 01:19:29,127
<i>Learning to rock and roll</i>

947
01:19:29,353 --> 01:19:32,026
<i>Spin around like a crazy elf</i>

948
01:19:32,663 --> 01:19:34,971
<i>Dancing by himself</i>

949
01:19:35,213 --> 01:19:38,107
<i>Boogie down like a unicorn</i>

950
01:19:38,348 --> 01:19:40,962
<i>No stopping till the break of dawn</i>

951
01:19:41,212 --> 01:19:44,032
<i>Put your hands up in the air</i>

952
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:46,971
<i>Like an ogre who just don't care</i>

953
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:50,459
<i>Can you dance like a Hippogriff?</i>

954
01:19:52,694 --> 01:19:54,311
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

955
01:19:57,397 --> 01:19:59,793
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

956
01:20:02,414 --> 01:20:03,686
May I have your arm?

957
01:20:03,997 --> 01:20:06,693
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

958
01:20:32,765 --> 01:20:33,903
Hot, isn't it?

959
01:20:35,175 --> 01:20:38,101
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

960
01:20:38,653 --> 01:20:41,677
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

961
01:20:43,986 --> 01:20:45,653
What's got your wand in a knot?

962
01:20:46,653 --> 01:20:48,044
He's a Durmstrang.

963
01:20:48,592 --> 01:20:49,983
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

964
01:20:50,354 --> 01:20:51,352
The enemy?

965
01:20:52,564 --> 01:20:54,349
Who was it wanting his autograph?

966
01:20:54,793 --> 01:20:57,046
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament is...

967
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:00,422
...international magical cooperation...

968
01:21:01,455 --> 01:21:02,955
...to make friends.

969
01:21:03,753 --> 01:21:06,127
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

970
01:21:16,845 --> 01:21:18,707
Are you going to ask me to dance or not?

971
01:21:19,269 --> 01:21:20,221
No.

972
01:21:28,523 --> 01:21:31,424
- He's using you.
- How dare you?

973
01:21:31,702 --> 01:21:33,581
Besides, I can take care of myself.

974
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:35,825
I doubt it. He's way too old.

975
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:38,522
What? What? That's what you think?

976
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:39,733
Yeah, that's what I think.

977
01:21:39,818 --> 01:21:41,755
You know the solution then, don't you?

978
01:21:42,173 --> 01:21:43,058
Go on.

979
01:21:43,324 --> 01:21:44,386
Next time there's a ball

980
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:47,467
pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

981
01:21:47,552 --> 01:21:49,465
And not as a last resort.

982
01:21:49,843 --> 01:21:53,663
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

983
01:21:54,223 --> 01:21:55,223
Harry.

984
01:21:56,013 --> 01:21:57,127
Where have you been?

985
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:59,219
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

986
01:22:02,813 --> 01:22:06,648
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

987
01:22:07,102 --> 01:22:08,124
What's this about?

988
01:22:13,163 --> 01:22:16,015
<i>No, don't let</i>

989
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:22,216
<i>This magic die</i>

990
01:22:23,646 --> 01:22:26,635
<i>The answer's there</i>

991
01:23:25,143 --> 01:23:26,727
Let me see it again.

992
01:23:28,444 --> 01:23:31,258
Yes, the time is close now.

993
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,014
Harry, at last!

994
01:23:39,188 --> 01:23:44,533
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

995
01:23:55,223 --> 01:23:56,526
You all right, Harry?

996
01:23:58,093 --> 01:23:59,278
I just got in.

997
01:24:00,473 --> 01:24:01,531
Me.

998
01:24:12,983 --> 01:24:15,856
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

999
01:24:16,364 --> 01:24:18,255
The task is two days from now.

1000
01:24:18,389 --> 01:24:19,975
Really? I had no idea.

1001
01:24:22,248 --> 01:24:24,038
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

1002
01:24:24,123 --> 01:24:26,223
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

1003
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:32,054
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

1004
01:24:36,418 --> 01:24:39,094
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

1005
01:24:40,016 --> 01:24:41,682
Mostly, he watches me study.

1006
01:24:43,223 --> 01:24:44,667
It's a bit annoying, actually.

1007
01:24:46,683 --> 01:24:48,622
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

1008
01:24:50,233 --> 01:24:51,480
What's that supposed to mean?

1009
01:24:52,313 --> 01:24:54,566
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

1010
01:24:55,483 --> 01:24:56,581
...in the most brutal way.

1011
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:58,012
They're almost cruel.

1012
01:24:59,823 --> 01:25:00,697
And...

1013
01:25:03,783 --> 01:25:04,967
...I'm scared for you.

1014
01:25:06,623 --> 01:25:08,591
You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.

1015
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:11,636
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

1016
01:25:12,503 --> 01:25:13,420
Hey, Potter!

1017
01:25:19,923 --> 01:25:21,438
- Potter!
- Cedric.

1018
01:25:23,984 --> 01:25:25,185
How...? How are you?

1019
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:27,801
Spectacular.

1020
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:31,763
Look, I realize I never really
thanked you properly

1021
01:25:31,848 --> 01:25:33,595
for tipping me off about those dragons.

1022
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:34,666
Forget about it.

1023
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,254
I'm sure you would've
done the same for me.

1024
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:37,212
Exactly.

1025
01:25:39,113 --> 01:25:41,479
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

1026
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,537
It's not a bad place for a bath.

1027
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:52,286
Just take your egg and...

1028
01:25:53,036 --> 01:25:55,096
...mull things over in the hot water.

1029
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,167
I must be out of my mind.

1030
01:26:43,423 --> 01:26:44,907
I'm definitely out of my mind.

1031
01:26:48,263 --> 01:26:51,258
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

1032
01:26:51,723 --> 01:26:52,708
Myrtle!

1033
01:26:53,527 --> 01:26:54,664
Hello, Harry.

1034
01:26:55,987 --> 01:26:58,756
Long time no see.

1035
01:27:03,696 --> 01:27:07,501
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

1036
01:27:07,586 --> 01:27:10,887
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

1037
01:27:11,242 --> 01:27:13,658
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

1038
01:27:13,743 --> 01:27:14,973
Polyjuice Potion?

1039
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,138
Kicked the habit.

1040
01:27:17,223 --> 01:27:20,373
Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

1041
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,690
That's what he did.

1042
01:27:29,534 --> 01:27:30,835
The other boy...

1043
01:27:32,628 --> 01:27:34,256
...the handsome one...

1044
01:27:36,039 --> 01:27:37,343
...Cedric.

1045
01:27:40,653 --> 01:27:43,142
Well, go on. Open it.

1046
01:27:51,493 --> 01:27:56,517
<i>Come seek us where our voices sound</i>

1047
01:27:56,602 --> 01:28:01,276
<i>We cannot sing above the ground</i>

1048
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:06,002
<i>An hour long you'll have to look</i>

1049
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:11,199
<i>To recover what we took</i>

1050
01:28:19,332 --> 01:28:20,320
Myrtle...

1051
01:28:22,353 --> 01:28:25,173
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

1052
01:28:26,606 --> 01:28:28,272
Very good.

1053
01:28:29,212 --> 01:28:33,331
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

1054
01:28:34,123 --> 01:28:37,429
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

1055
01:28:55,544 --> 01:28:56,841
Harry, tell me again.

1056
01:28:59,088 --> 01:29:01,874
"Come seek us where our voices sound."

1057
01:29:02,113 --> 01:29:04,386
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

1058
01:29:05,733 --> 01:29:07,716
"An hour long you'll have to look."

1059
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:09,586
Again, obvious.

1060
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:11,962
Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

1061
01:29:13,283 --> 01:29:14,845
"Potentially problematic"?

1062
01:29:15,106 --> 01:29:18,320
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1063
01:29:19,123 --> 01:29:23,497
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1064
01:29:23,726 --> 01:29:25,776
Hate to break up the skull session.

1065
01:29:26,102 --> 01:29:28,223
Professor McGonagall
would like to see you in her office.

1066
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,570
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1067
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:33,629
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1068
01:29:33,714 --> 01:29:34,562
Exactly.

1069
01:29:34,647 --> 01:29:36,492
Presumably Potter is well prepared by now

1070
01:29:36,577 --> 01:29:38,502
and could do with a good night's sleep.

1071
01:29:38,683 --> 01:29:40,381
Go. Now!

1072
01:29:51,233 --> 01:29:52,094
Longbottom!

1073
01:29:53,149 --> 01:29:55,236
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1074
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:06,166
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1075
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:08,833
...you'd be better off with
"Goshawk's Guide to Herbology".

1076
01:30:09,328 --> 01:30:13,732
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1077
01:30:13,817 --> 01:30:17,703
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1078
01:30:18,236 --> 01:30:19,212
...about plants.

1079
01:30:20,298 --> 01:30:21,436
Now, if there's a...

1080
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:25,645
...Tibetan turnip that will allow me

1081
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:28,019
to breathe underwater
for an hour then great.

1082
01:30:28,997 --> 01:30:29,840
But otherwise...

1083
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:33,047
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1084
01:30:34,562 --> 01:30:37,052
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1085
01:30:37,913 --> 01:30:39,533
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1086
01:30:39,618 --> 01:30:40,848
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1087
01:30:40,933 --> 01:30:42,640
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1088
01:30:43,352 --> 01:30:44,405
Don't be so mean.

1089
01:30:45,678 --> 01:30:47,515
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1090
01:30:49,748 --> 01:30:51,538
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1091
01:30:51,623 --> 01:30:53,526
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1092
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:54,813
Most likely?

1093
01:30:55,638 --> 01:30:57,848
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1094
01:30:57,933 --> 01:31:00,331
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1095
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:03,100
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1096
01:31:03,185 --> 01:31:05,175
I just wanted to help.

1097
01:31:05,523 --> 01:31:07,857
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1098
01:31:08,739 --> 01:31:10,112
Where are they anyway?

1099
01:31:10,685 --> 01:31:13,008
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1100
01:31:20,687 --> 01:31:22,779
Welcome to the second task.

1101
01:31:23,203 --> 01:31:26,514
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1102
01:31:26,994 --> 01:31:28,313
A treasure of sorts.

1103
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:31,360
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1104
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:33,658
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1105
01:31:34,174 --> 01:31:35,413
In order to win...

1106
01:31:35,498 --> 01:31:39,422
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1107
01:31:39,798 --> 01:31:42,521
- Simple enough, except for this.
- Put that in your mouth.

1108
01:31:42,606 --> 01:31:46,243
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1109
01:31:46,519 --> 01:31:50,487
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1110
01:31:50,976 --> 01:31:53,258
You may begin at the sound of the cannon.

1111
01:32:19,803 --> 01:32:22,668
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1112
01:32:24,016 --> 01:32:26,868
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1113
01:32:28,879 --> 01:32:30,709
Yeah!

1114
01:32:31,983 --> 01:32:32,945
What?

1115
01:33:53,183 --> 01:33:55,389
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1116
01:33:55,474 --> 01:33:58,006
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1117
01:33:58,609 --> 01:34:01,005
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1118
01:35:19,563 --> 01:35:21,150
But she's my friend too!

1119
01:35:22,896 --> 01:35:24,211
Only one!

1120
01:36:16,073 --> 01:36:17,401
Let's get down below.

1121
01:36:28,003 --> 01:36:30,889
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1122
01:37:27,876 --> 01:37:29,245
Yes!

1123
01:37:48,139 --> 01:37:49,918
<i>Ascendio!</i>

1124
01:37:55,463 --> 01:37:56,542
Harry!

1125
01:37:59,544 --> 01:38:00,482
He's all right.

1126
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,153
He's all right. Barty!

1127
01:38:03,763 --> 01:38:04,993
Go get him another towel.

1128
01:38:05,078 --> 01:38:07,136
I want all the judges over here now!

1129
01:38:07,773 --> 01:38:11,266
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1130
01:38:11,943 --> 01:38:13,353
My little sister.

1131
01:38:14,023 --> 01:38:15,049
Thank you.

1132
01:38:16,403 --> 01:38:18,517
And you! You helped.

1133
01:38:19,608 --> 01:38:21,813
Well, yeah, a bit.

1134
01:38:28,219 --> 01:38:29,331
<i>Merci.</i>

1135
01:38:29,828 --> 01:38:31,119
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1136
01:38:31,204 --> 01:38:33,307
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1137
01:38:35,022 --> 01:38:37,014
Personally, I think
you behaved admirably.

1138
01:38:37,343 --> 01:38:39,040
I finished last, Hermione.

1139
01:38:40,223 --> 01:38:44,041
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1140
01:38:44,126 --> 01:38:47,556
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1141
01:38:47,933 --> 01:38:49,996
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1142
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,689
Attention!

1143
01:38:56,065 --> 01:38:59,919
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1144
01:39:00,488 --> 01:39:03,732
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1145
01:39:04,278 --> 01:39:06,948
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1146
01:39:07,033 --> 01:39:11,812
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1147
01:39:11,897 --> 01:39:15,852
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1148
01:39:16,485 --> 01:39:17,881
...second place...

1149
01:39:18,813 --> 01:39:20,338
- Second place!
- Well done!

1150
01:39:20,423 --> 01:39:22,933
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1151
01:39:24,343 --> 01:39:25,890
Yes!

1152
01:39:29,473 --> 01:39:31,263
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1153
01:39:31,348 --> 01:39:33,022
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1154
01:39:33,107 --> 01:39:35,445
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1155
01:39:35,530 --> 01:39:38,148
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1156
01:39:38,523 --> 01:39:40,210
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1157
01:39:40,295 --> 01:39:41,176
Well done, boy.

1158
01:39:42,073 --> 01:39:44,908
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1159
01:39:45,443 --> 01:39:49,502
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1160
01:39:50,493 --> 01:39:51,637
Quite remarkable, really.

1161
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:53,429
Tragic, of course...

1162
01:39:54,123 --> 01:39:55,630
...to lose one's family.

1163
01:39:58,077 --> 01:39:59,637
Never whole again, are we?

1164
01:40:02,388 --> 01:40:04,286
Still, life goes on...

1165
01:40:05,303 --> 01:40:06,428
...and here we stand.

1166
01:40:09,893 --> 01:40:12,563
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1167
01:40:12,648 --> 01:40:13,762
Bartemius!

1168
01:40:14,393 --> 01:40:18,124
Not trying to lure Potter into one of the
Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1169
01:40:18,497 --> 01:40:21,210
The last boy who went into the
Department of Mysteries never came out!

1170
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:35,702
And they say I'm mad.

1171
01:40:45,553 --> 01:40:48,746
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1172
01:40:49,347 --> 01:40:52,363
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1173
01:40:52,973 --> 01:40:54,857
Suppose you remind me of meself a little.

1174
01:40:55,426 --> 01:40:58,172
And here we all are, four years later.

1175
01:40:58,513 --> 01:40:59,857
We're still a bunch of misfits.

1176
01:40:59,942 --> 01:41:02,607
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1177
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:04,474
And Harry, of course.

1178
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:10,082
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1179
01:41:10,569 --> 01:41:11,717
Hooray!

1180
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:16,772
<i>Hogwarts, Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts</i>

1181
01:41:16,857 --> 01:41:19,472
<i>Teach us something, please</i>

1182
01:41:29,354 --> 01:41:30,487
Mr. Crouch?

1183
01:41:38,063 --> 01:41:39,845
A man has died here, Fudge.

1184
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:41,776
And he won't be the last.
You must take action.

1185
01:41:41,868 --> 01:41:43,241
I will not.

1186
01:41:43,455 --> 01:41:44,682
In times like these,

1187
01:41:44,767 --> 01:41:47,769
the wizard world looks to its
leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1188
01:41:47,854 --> 01:41:49,053
Then for once show them some!

1189
01:41:49,138 --> 01:41:51,577
The Triwizard Tournament
will not be canceled.

1190
01:41:51,662 --> 01:41:53,554
I will not be seen as a coward!

1191
01:41:53,639 --> 01:41:56,601
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1192
01:41:56,686 --> 01:41:57,801
What did you say?

1193
01:41:57,886 --> 01:41:59,522
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1194
01:41:59,784 --> 01:42:02,697
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1195
01:42:07,923 --> 01:42:08,920
Oh, Harry!

1196
01:42:09,555 --> 01:42:11,725
Harry, how good to see you again.

1197
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,388
I can come back later, professor.

1198
01:42:14,473 --> 01:42:15,518
Not necessary, Harry.

1199
01:42:15,603 --> 01:42:17,951
The minister and I are done.
I'll be back in a moment.

1200
01:42:18,036 --> 01:42:19,870
Minister, after you.

1201
01:42:21,103 --> 01:42:23,110
There you are. Your hat.

1202
01:42:23,195 --> 01:42:26,754
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1203
01:42:26,839 --> 01:42:29,841
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1204
01:44:01,743 --> 01:44:02,795
Professor?

1205
01:44:03,543 --> 01:44:05,201
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1206
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:20,792
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1207
01:44:20,877 --> 01:44:22,804
...to present evidence to this council.

1208
01:44:22,947 --> 01:44:25,466
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1209
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:29,280
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1210
01:44:30,153 --> 01:44:33,207
Until such time, you remain
in the eyes of the Ministry

1211
01:44:33,292 --> 01:44:34,702
a convicted Death Eater.

1212
01:44:34,787 --> 01:44:36,392
Do you accept these terms?

1213
01:44:37,153 --> 01:44:39,125
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1214
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,037
I have names, sir.

1215
01:44:43,054 --> 01:44:46,470
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1216
01:44:49,392 --> 01:44:50,628
Rosier is dead.

1217
01:44:50,713 --> 01:44:53,068
He took a piece of me with him
though, didn't he?

1218
01:44:53,234 --> 01:44:54,377
I didn't know.

1219
01:44:54,462 --> 01:44:55,954
If that is all the
witness has to offer...

1220
01:44:56,039 --> 01:44:57,138
No, no, no.

1221
01:44:57,303 --> 01:44:59,912
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1222
01:45:00,763 --> 01:45:03,218
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1223
01:45:03,303 --> 01:45:04,471
Yeah, yeah the same.

1224
01:45:04,556 --> 01:45:07,713
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1225
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,428
Very well.

1226
01:45:10,983 --> 01:45:12,250
Council will deliberate.

1227
01:45:13,015 --> 01:45:15,022
In the meantime,
you will be returned to Azkaban.

1228
01:45:15,107 --> 01:45:19,849
No! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1229
01:45:19,934 --> 01:45:22,983
As the council is very much aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1230
01:45:23,068 --> 01:45:25,157
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater

1231
01:45:25,242 --> 01:45:27,180
and, prior to Lord
Voldemort's downfall...

1232
01:45:27,265 --> 01:45:29,479
...turned spy for us at
great personal risk.

1233
01:45:29,564 --> 01:45:30,418
It's a lie!

1234
01:45:30,503 --> 01:45:32,001
Today he's no more a Death Eater than I.

1235
01:45:32,086 --> 01:45:33,926
Severus Snape remains faithful
to the Dark Lord!

1236
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:36,039
Silence!

1237
01:45:37,003 --> 01:45:40,352
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1238
01:45:40,437 --> 01:45:42,387
...this session is now concluded.

1239
01:45:42,883 --> 01:45:44,532
Oh, no, no, no.

1240
01:45:46,018 --> 01:45:47,478
I've heard about one more.

1241
01:45:47,563 --> 01:45:49,388
- What's that?
- The name.

1242
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:51,808
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1243
01:45:51,893 --> 01:45:53,624
...this person took part
in the capture...

1244
01:45:54,012 --> 01:45:56,358
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1245
01:45:56,443 --> 01:46:00,116
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1246
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,475
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1247
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,743
Barty Crouch...

1248
01:46:07,873 --> 01:46:08,951
...Junior.

1249
01:46:18,383 --> 01:46:19,648
Hold him down!

1250
01:46:23,723 --> 01:46:26,832
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1251
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:30,161
Hello, Father.

1252
01:46:31,987 --> 01:46:33,504
You are no son of mine.

1253
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:49,260
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1254
01:46:51,283 --> 01:46:52,611
It's a Pensieve.

1255
01:46:52,696 --> 01:46:56,982
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1256
01:46:57,673 --> 01:47:00,732
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1257
01:47:01,673 --> 01:47:04,403
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1258
01:47:04,803 --> 01:47:06,576
...some small detail...

1259
01:47:07,803 --> 01:47:09,428
...something I might have overlooked...

1260
01:47:10,103 --> 01:47:13,620
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1261
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:18,789
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1262
01:47:19,938 --> 01:47:21,249
It's maddening.

1263
01:47:23,138 --> 01:47:25,464
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1264
01:47:26,493 --> 01:47:28,189
What exactly happened to him?

1265
01:47:28,664 --> 01:47:30,467
He was sent to Azkaban.

1266
01:47:31,366 --> 01:47:32,992
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1267
01:47:34,203 --> 01:47:37,386
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1268
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:41,532
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1269
01:47:43,003 --> 01:47:44,782
I had a dream about him.

1270
01:47:47,383 --> 01:47:49,616
It was in the summer, before school.

1271
01:47:52,353 --> 01:47:54,667
In the dream, I was in a house.

1272
01:47:55,523 --> 01:47:59,778
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.

1273
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:03,292
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.

1274
01:48:04,483 --> 01:48:06,985
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

1275
01:48:08,153 --> 01:48:09,359
Always the same one.

1276
01:48:12,703 --> 01:48:14,836
Sir, these dreams...

1277
01:48:15,207 --> 01:48:19,550
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1278
01:48:22,123 --> 01:48:24,772
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1279
01:48:25,553 --> 01:48:27,206
I think it's best if you simply...

1280
01:48:33,223 --> 01:48:34,480
...cast them away.

1281
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:47,531
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1282
01:48:56,929 --> 01:48:57,866
Potter!

1283
01:48:58,333 --> 01:49:00,554
What's your hurry?

1284
01:49:06,018 --> 01:49:09,280
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1285
01:49:09,923 --> 01:49:11,564
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1286
01:49:12,885 --> 01:49:13,753
Yes, sir.

1287
01:49:15,433 --> 01:49:16,375
Ingenious.

1288
01:49:18,643 --> 01:49:21,786
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1289
01:49:23,443 --> 01:49:26,464
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1290
01:49:28,613 --> 01:49:30,246
Nor is this.

1291
01:49:34,783 --> 01:49:35,793
Know what it is?

1292
01:49:37,743 --> 01:49:39,151
Bubble juice, sir?

1293
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:41,303
Veritaserum.

1294
01:49:42,373 --> 01:49:46,137
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1295
01:49:46,222 --> 01:49:49,806
The use of it on a student
is, regrettably, forbidden.

1296
01:49:49,890 --> 01:49:50,743
However...

1297
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:55,149
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1298
01:49:55,234 --> 01:50:00,281
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1299
01:50:00,366 --> 01:50:04,746
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1300
01:50:05,853 --> 01:50:11,869
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1301
01:50:12,283 --> 01:50:15,613
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1302
01:50:15,698 --> 01:50:17,056
...I'm going to find out why!

1303
01:50:44,813 --> 01:50:46,502
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1304
01:51:05,416 --> 01:51:07,015
<i>Sonorus!</i>

1305
01:51:11,256 --> 01:51:16,636
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1306
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:18,896
Only he knows its exact position.

1307
01:51:19,385 --> 01:51:21,086
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1308
01:51:23,933 --> 01:51:25,013
...and Mr. Potter...

1309
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:29,211
...are tied for first position...

1310
01:51:29,296 --> 01:51:31,355
...they will be the first
to enter the maze,

1311
01:51:31,646 --> 01:51:32,905
followed by Mr. Krum...

1312
01:51:34,617 --> 01:51:37,874
- ...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1313
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:42,436
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1314
01:51:46,663 --> 01:51:49,347
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1315
01:51:49,533 --> 01:51:52,374
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1316
01:51:52,459 --> 01:51:56,666
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1317
01:51:57,375 --> 01:52:00,423
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1318
01:52:04,465 --> 01:52:08,367
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1319
01:52:09,063 --> 01:52:12,047
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1320
01:52:12,412 --> 01:52:15,559
You see, people change in the maze.

1321
01:52:15,644 --> 01:52:17,497
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1322
01:52:17,745 --> 01:52:21,732
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1323
01:52:23,913 --> 01:52:26,374
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1324
01:52:34,703 --> 01:52:36,462
Cedric, good luck.

1325
01:52:37,555 --> 01:52:38,842
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1326
01:52:42,327 --> 01:52:44,683
On the count of three. One...

1327
01:56:12,219 --> 01:56:13,215
Fleur?

1328
01:56:15,383 --> 01:56:16,280
Fleur.

1329
01:56:20,450 --> 01:56:21,542
<i>Periculum!</i>

1330
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:01,850
Get down!

1331
01:57:02,933 --> 01:57:04,045
Get down!

1332
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:06,375
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1333
01:57:16,042 --> 01:57:19,282
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1334
01:57:19,367 --> 01:57:20,899
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1335
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:34,136
Yes.

1336
01:57:55,592 --> 01:57:56,735
Harry!

1337
01:57:59,736 --> 01:58:00,757
Harry!

1338
01:58:03,548 --> 01:58:04,518
Harry!

1339
01:58:07,698 --> 01:58:08,713
Harry!

1340
01:58:11,007 --> 01:58:12,181
<i>Reducto!</i>

1341
01:58:29,933 --> 01:58:31,698
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1342
01:58:32,813 --> 01:58:36,990
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1343
01:58:37,693 --> 01:58:38,846
For a moment, so did I.

1344
01:58:41,323 --> 01:58:42,493
Some game, huh?

1345
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:44,368
Some game.

1346
01:58:50,484 --> 01:58:51,446
Go!

1347
01:59:02,133 --> 01:59:04,777
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1348
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:07,293
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1349
01:59:07,378 --> 01:59:08,355
...three!
...three!

1350
01:59:20,852 --> 01:59:23,508
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1351
01:59:31,076 --> 01:59:32,257
Where are we?

1352
01:59:38,086 --> 01:59:39,319
I've been here before.

1353
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:44,622
It's a Portkey.

1354
01:59:46,917 --> 01:59:50,398
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1355
01:59:52,963 --> 01:59:55,484
Cedric! We have to get back to the cup.

1356
01:59:55,922 --> 01:59:56,783
Now!

1357
01:59:56,868 --> 01:59:57,952
What are you talking about?

1358
02:00:03,993 --> 02:00:06,273
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1359
02:00:14,265 --> 02:00:16,958
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1360
02:00:17,043 --> 02:00:19,954
<i>- Avada Kedavra!</i>
- No! Cedric!

1361
02:00:30,968 --> 02:00:32,779
Do it! Now!

1362
02:00:44,792 --> 02:00:47,121
Bone of the father...

1363
02:00:47,366 --> 02:00:49,924
...unwillingly given.

1364
02:00:57,294 --> 02:01:00,294
Flesh of the servant...

1365
02:01:02,415 --> 02:01:05,082
...willingly sacrificed.

1366
02:01:09,779 --> 02:01:12,479
And blood of the enemy...

1367
02:01:19,107 --> 02:01:21,453
...forcibly taken.

1368
02:01:27,823 --> 02:01:30,820
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1369
02:01:31,533 --> 02:01:32,451
...again.

1370
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:39,424
My wand, Wormtail.

1371
02:02:49,823 --> 02:02:51,417
Hold out your arm.

1372
02:02:52,037 --> 02:02:53,122
Master.

1373
02:02:53,697 --> 02:02:55,784
Thank you, master.

1374
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:58,014
The other arm, Wormtail.

1375
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:40,039
Welcome, my friends.

1376
02:03:41,867 --> 02:03:44,798
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1377
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:49,955
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1378
02:03:51,819 --> 02:03:53,814
I confess myself...

1379
02:03:55,140 --> 02:03:56,279
...disappointed.

1380
02:03:57,423 --> 02:03:59,395
Not one of you tried to find me.

1381
02:03:59,683 --> 02:04:03,054
Crabbe! Macnair!

1382
02:04:03,863 --> 02:04:05,025
Goyle!

1383
02:04:07,646 --> 02:04:08,835
Not even you...

1384
02:04:13,266 --> 02:04:14,354
...Lucius.

1385
02:04:17,073 --> 02:04:21,742
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1386
02:04:21,827 --> 02:04:25,105
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1387
02:04:25,190 --> 02:04:30,359
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1388
02:04:32,164 --> 02:04:37,613
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1389
02:04:39,763 --> 02:04:41,673
...that is my true mask.

1390
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:43,814
I returned.

1391
02:04:46,678 --> 02:04:49,792
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1392
02:04:51,749 --> 02:04:56,818
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1393
02:05:02,624 --> 02:05:05,043
Thank you, master.

1394
02:05:05,646 --> 02:05:06,732
Thank you.

1395
02:05:10,583 --> 02:05:12,885
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1396
02:05:14,423 --> 02:05:15,451
Harry.

1397
02:05:16,025 --> 02:05:18,585
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1398
02:05:19,045 --> 02:05:21,663
Standing on the bones of my father.

1399
02:05:22,452 --> 02:05:23,387
Yeah.

1400
02:05:23,612 --> 02:05:24,631
I'd introduce you...

1401
02:05:24,716 --> 02:05:28,800
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1402
02:05:32,056 --> 02:05:34,318
The boy who lived.

1403
02:05:34,904 --> 02:05:37,736
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1404
02:05:38,042 --> 02:05:41,617
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1405
02:05:41,913 --> 02:05:46,481
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1406
02:05:46,993 --> 02:05:48,167
Yes, shall I?

1407
02:05:49,115 --> 02:05:50,112
It was love.

1408
02:05:50,644 --> 02:05:54,952
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1409
02:05:55,037 --> 02:05:57,633
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1410
02:05:58,143 --> 02:05:59,384
I could not touch him.

1411
02:06:01,167 --> 02:06:03,071
It was old magic.

1412
02:06:03,570 --> 02:06:05,265
Something I should have foreseen.

1413
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:07,532
But no matter, no matter.

1414
02:06:07,929 --> 02:06:09,773
Things have changed.

1415
02:06:10,869 --> 02:06:13,462
I can touch you...

1416
02:06:14,976 --> 02:06:15,868
...now.

1417
02:06:24,913 --> 02:06:25,783
Yeah.

1418
02:06:32,504 --> 02:06:35,590
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1419
02:06:36,963 --> 02:06:38,445
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1420
02:06:40,702 --> 02:06:43,075
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1421
02:06:44,688 --> 02:06:46,827
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1422
02:06:46,912 --> 02:06:49,249
First, we bow to each other.

1423
02:06:49,683 --> 02:06:52,093
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1424
02:06:52,178 --> 02:06:54,846
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1425
02:06:55,190 --> 02:06:57,024
I said, bow.

1426
02:06:58,813 --> 02:07:02,444
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1427
02:07:03,406 --> 02:07:04,563
<i>Crucio!</i>

1428
02:07:07,792 --> 02:07:09,081
<i>Crucio!</i>

1429
02:07:10,703 --> 02:07:12,143
Attaboy, Harry.

1430
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:14,507
Your parents would be proud.

1431
02:07:15,122 --> 02:07:18,261
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1432
02:07:18,346 --> 02:07:19,353
<i>Expelliar...</i>

1433
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:25,547
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1434
02:07:26,013 --> 02:07:27,480
I'm going to destroy you.

1435
02:07:30,183 --> 02:07:35,661
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1436
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:39,004
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1437
02:07:39,089 --> 02:07:40,922
...they'll speak only of how you...

1438
02:07:42,052 --> 02:07:43,299
...begged for death.

1439
02:07:44,113 --> 02:07:46,689
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1440
02:07:48,403 --> 02:07:49,429
...obliged.

1441
02:07:50,363 --> 02:07:51,258
Get up!

1442
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:58,668
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1443
02:07:58,753 --> 02:08:01,079
I want you to look at me when I kill you!

1444
02:08:01,309 --> 02:08:04,046
I want to see the light leave your eyes!

1445
02:08:18,443 --> 02:08:19,443
Have it your way.

1446
02:08:21,353 --> 02:08:23,084
<i>- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!</i>

1447
02:08:41,253 --> 02:08:43,760
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1448
02:08:48,503 --> 02:08:49,858
He's mine!

1449
02:09:23,269 --> 02:09:26,982
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1450
02:09:27,415 --> 02:09:29,336
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1451
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:31,211
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1452
02:09:32,633 --> 02:09:35,246
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1453
02:09:36,048 --> 02:09:37,766
Take my body back to my father.

1454
02:09:39,433 --> 02:09:40,546
Let go.

1455
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:42,682
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1456
02:09:44,023 --> 02:09:46,577
Let go! Let go!

1457
02:09:52,403 --> 02:09:53,846
<i>Accio!</i>

1458
02:09:59,325 --> 02:10:01,334
No!

1459
02:10:14,213 --> 02:10:15,474
He did it!

1460
02:10:17,173 --> 02:10:18,149
Harry!

1461
02:10:21,069 --> 02:10:22,127
Harry!

1462
02:10:24,032 --> 02:10:26,657
No! No! No, don't!

1463
02:10:27,948 --> 02:10:29,818
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1464
02:10:29,903 --> 02:10:32,033
He's back. He's back.

1465
02:10:32,714 --> 02:10:34,030
Voldemort's back.

1466
02:10:34,405 --> 02:10:36,811
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1467
02:10:37,024 --> 02:10:39,570
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1468
02:10:39,655 --> 02:10:42,296
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1469
02:10:42,990 --> 02:10:45,233
He's home. You both are.

1470
02:10:45,318 --> 02:10:48,595
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1471
02:10:52,043 --> 02:10:55,441
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1472
02:10:55,887 --> 02:10:56,832
Let me through.

1473
02:10:57,813 --> 02:10:58,856
Let me through!

1474
02:11:01,239 --> 02:11:02,409
Let me through!

1475
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:04,153
That's my son!

1476
02:11:05,349 --> 02:11:06,925
That's my boy!

1477
02:11:09,733 --> 02:11:11,611
It's my boy!

1478
02:11:15,233 --> 02:11:18,049
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1479
02:11:19,102 --> 02:11:21,332
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1480
02:11:22,377 --> 02:11:24,728
No!

1481
02:11:27,913 --> 02:11:29,679
It's all right, I got you.

1482
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:33,129
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1483
02:11:37,803 --> 02:11:39,074
No!

1484
02:11:40,624 --> 02:11:42,372
No!

1485
02:12:24,973 --> 02:12:26,057
Are you all right, Potter?

1486
02:12:27,344 --> 02:12:28,841
Does it hurt? That?

1487
02:12:29,353 --> 02:12:30,592
Not so much now.

1488
02:12:32,103 --> 02:12:33,532
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1489
02:12:37,313 --> 02:12:38,658
The cup was a Portkey.

1490
02:12:42,033 --> 02:12:43,198
Someone had bewitched it.

1491
02:12:44,153 --> 02:12:45,248
What was it like?

1492
02:12:46,573 --> 02:12:48,279
- What was he like?
- Who?

1493
02:12:48,364 --> 02:12:49,616
The Dark Lord.

1494
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:55,020
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1495
02:12:56,833 --> 02:12:57,738
I don't know.

1496
02:13:01,503 --> 02:13:03,947
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1497
02:13:07,393 --> 02:13:08,741
...into one of my nightmares.

1498
02:13:28,018 --> 02:13:29,029
Were there others?

1499
02:13:29,825 --> 02:13:31,299
In the graveyard, were there others?

1500
02:13:36,043 --> 02:13:36,948
I...

1501
02:13:37,964 --> 02:13:41,581
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1502
02:13:49,497 --> 02:13:52,246
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1503
02:13:57,325 --> 02:13:59,737
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1504
02:13:59,822 --> 02:14:01,281
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1505
02:14:05,854 --> 02:14:09,681
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1506
02:14:09,766 --> 02:14:11,456
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1507
02:14:13,737 --> 02:14:15,819
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1508
02:14:16,813 --> 02:14:19,238
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1509
02:14:19,323 --> 02:14:20,736
...that led him straight to it?

1510
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:31,289
It was you from the beginning.

1511
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:34,037
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1512
02:14:34,603 --> 02:14:37,564
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1513
02:14:38,433 --> 02:14:40,563
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1514
02:14:41,233 --> 02:14:44,613
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1515
02:14:44,903 --> 02:14:46,205
And now the deed is done.

1516
02:14:47,748 --> 02:14:51,263
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1517
02:15:00,523 --> 02:15:04,391
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1518
02:15:05,046 --> 02:15:06,899
...that I have once and for all...

1519
02:15:08,130 --> 02:15:12,390
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1520
02:15:12,475 --> 02:15:13,685
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1521
02:15:18,580 --> 02:15:19,655
Severus.

1522
02:15:22,314 --> 02:15:23,749
That's it, take it.

1523
02:15:25,935 --> 02:15:27,037
Do you know who I am?

1524
02:15:27,857 --> 02:15:29,352
Albus Dumbledore.

1525
02:15:29,437 --> 02:15:32,143
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1526
02:15:32,453 --> 02:15:35,374
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1527
02:15:38,402 --> 02:15:39,546
Harry, away from there!

1528
02:16:01,103 --> 02:16:02,415
You all right, Alastor?

1529
02:16:02,998 --> 02:16:04,467
I'm sorry, Albus.

1530
02:16:05,319 --> 02:16:06,688
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1531
02:16:09,273 --> 02:16:10,440
Polyjuice Potion.

1532
02:16:10,525 --> 02:16:13,019
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1533
02:16:13,957 --> 02:16:15,306
We'll get you up in a minute.

1534
02:16:50,268 --> 02:16:51,190
Harry!

1535
02:16:55,308 --> 02:16:57,169
Barty Crouch Junior.

1536
02:16:57,786 --> 02:17:00,231
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

1537
02:17:03,203 --> 02:17:04,436
Your arm, Harry.

1538
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:10,467
You know what this means, don't you?

1539
02:17:11,796 --> 02:17:12,846
He's back.

1540
02:17:14,423 --> 02:17:16,411
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1541
02:17:17,513 --> 02:17:19,195
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1542
02:17:20,053 --> 02:17:21,487
Send an owl to Azkaban.

1543
02:17:22,174 --> 02:17:23,791
I think they'll find they're
missing a prisoner.

1544
02:17:24,913 --> 02:17:27,733
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1545
02:17:28,103 --> 02:17:30,366
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1546
02:17:50,730 --> 02:17:53,104
Today, we acknowledge...

1547
02:17:54,167 --> 02:17:56,113
...a really terrible loss.

1548
02:17:59,133 --> 02:18:01,407
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1549
02:18:01,986 --> 02:18:03,804
...exceptionally hard-working...

1550
02:18:05,180 --> 02:18:07,190
...infinitely fair-minded...

1551
02:18:08,130 --> 02:18:09,871
...and, most importantly...

1552
02:18:10,813 --> 02:18:14,723
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1553
02:18:16,523 --> 02:18:20,264
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1554
02:18:23,953 --> 02:18:24,909
You see...

1555
02:18:26,333 --> 02:18:28,203
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1556
02:18:29,224 --> 02:18:30,713
...by Lord Voldemort!

1557
02:18:33,213 --> 02:18:36,079
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1558
02:18:37,423 --> 02:18:40,355
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1559
02:18:43,223 --> 02:18:44,295
Now, the pain...

1560
02:18:45,110 --> 02:18:48,534
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1561
02:18:48,763 --> 02:18:49,929
...and reminds us...

1562
02:18:50,483 --> 02:18:54,129
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1563
02:18:54,353 --> 02:18:57,162
...our hearts beat as one.

1564
02:18:58,200 --> 02:18:59,621
In light of recent events...

1565
02:19:00,653 --> 02:19:02,715
...the bonds of friendship
we've made this year

1566
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:05,345
will be more important than ever.

1567
02:19:06,453 --> 02:19:10,842
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1568
02:19:12,203 --> 02:19:13,818
You remember that...

1569
02:19:14,963 --> 02:19:17,399
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1570
02:19:18,474 --> 02:19:20,425
...kind and honest and...

1571
02:19:21,470 --> 02:19:25,259
...brave and true, right to the very end.

1572
02:19:51,158 --> 02:19:52,758
I never liked these curtains.

1573
02:19:53,914 --> 02:19:55,937
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1574
02:19:56,892 --> 02:19:58,115
By accident, of course.

1575
02:20:04,473 --> 02:20:07,027
I put you in terrible
danger this year, Harry.

1576
02:20:07,473 --> 02:20:08,340
I'm sorry.

1577
02:20:12,157 --> 02:20:13,053
Professor...

1578
02:20:14,143 --> 02:20:16,578
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1579
02:20:17,882 --> 02:20:22,159
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1580
02:20:23,797 --> 02:20:25,621
<i>Priori Incantatem.</i>

1581
02:20:30,413 --> 02:20:32,374
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1582
02:20:33,703 --> 02:20:34,729
They reappeared.

1583
02:20:36,908 --> 02:20:40,022
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1584
02:20:43,343 --> 02:20:45,305
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1585
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:50,549
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1586
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:55,503
But remember this:

1587
02:20:56,473 --> 02:20:57,710
You have friends here.

1588
02:21:00,324 --> 02:21:01,296
You're not alone.

1589
02:21:22,745 --> 02:21:23,617
Hermione.

1590
02:21:24,955 --> 02:21:26,375
This is for you.

1591
02:21:27,542 --> 02:21:29,339
Write to me. Promise.

1592
02:21:30,772 --> 02:21:31,675
Bye.

1593
02:21:38,595 --> 02:21:39,673
<i>Au revoir</i>, Ron.

1594
02:22:24,393 --> 02:22:27,004
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1595
02:22:27,089 --> 02:22:28,199
- No.
- No.

1596
02:22:28,403 --> 02:22:29,577
No, I didn't think so.

1597
02:22:29,819 --> 02:22:32,146
Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1598
02:22:37,203 --> 02:22:39,275
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1599
02:22:47,333 --> 02:22:48,227
Yes.

1600
02:22:53,553 --> 02:22:56,771
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1601
02:22:56,856 --> 02:22:58,962
I won't. You know I won't.

1602
02:23:00,853 --> 02:23:03,697
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.


1
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,787
I don't know about you,
it's just too hot today, isn't it?

2
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,987
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,788
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow,
maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,587
So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...

5
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,387
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,585
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,394
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,593
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,990
I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.

10
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,386
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,984
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,389
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,386
Beat up another 10-year-old?

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,187
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,591
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,186
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,785
"Don't kill Cedric."

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,984
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,787
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."

20
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,587
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,792
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,984
She dead?

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,591
Is she dead?

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,591
Is she a dead Pott...?

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,989
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,986
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,992
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,184
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,189
Dudley, run.

30
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,791
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,189
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,589
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,387
They might come back.

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,992
Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,993
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- I don't understand. How do you know...?

36
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,389
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,790
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?

38
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,588
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,194
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

40
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,987
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,185
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,183
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,194
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

44
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,384
There's sweat. There's stifling.

45
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,391
Diddykins?

46
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,994
Is that you?

47
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,984
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,794
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,394
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,184
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,594
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.

52
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,592
Vernon, don't say that.

53
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,991
Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,184
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,387
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,384
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

57
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,588
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,185
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,384
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,393
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,994
...you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,788
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,790
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,987
Justice.

65
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,794
He's not very well.

66
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,589
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,391
Very clean, these Muggles.

68
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,790
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

69
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,991
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,390
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

71
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,387
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.

72
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,789
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

73
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,983
But the letter said...

74
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,992
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,389
...pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

76
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,790
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,984
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,391
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,385
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,194
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,591
Come on.

82
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,984
In you go, son.

83
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,592
There've been no sightings.

84
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,386
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,187
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...

86
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,591
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

87
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,589
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,991
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,390
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first
and a wizard second.

90
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,585
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.

91
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,390
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,387
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,187
Heavens, you're all right.

94
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,788
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,988
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.

96
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,991
Yeah.

97
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,788
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

98
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,590
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...

99
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,387
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

100
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,190
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,387
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

102
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,790
Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.

103
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,985
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,191
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,193
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,987
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,187
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.

108
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,384
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

109
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,585
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

110
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,592
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,791
So, what is this place?

112
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,985
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,792
It's a secret society.

114
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,394
Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,585
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, I suppose?

116
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,194
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.

117
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,988
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.

118
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,989
- Only...
- Only what?

119
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,788
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,984
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,987
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.

122
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,991
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,992
...the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,184
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,193
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
- Lf you're all done shouting...

126
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,192
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,185
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn't for Harry...

128
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,384
...we wouldn't even know
Voldemort was back.

129
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,992
He's not a child, Molly.

130
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,594
But he's not an adult either.

131
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,592
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.

132
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,989
He's as good as.

133
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,786
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.

134
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,394
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.

135
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,392
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon,
just like his godfather.

136
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,391
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

137
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,391
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

138
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,391
About your supposed reformation.

139
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,187
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?

140
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,986
- Get off it.
- Quick.

141
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,991
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

142
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,184
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

143
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,987
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

144
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,387
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,185
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,789
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...

147
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,792
...does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.

148
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,984
Hi, Mum.

149
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,186
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,794
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,587
Harry Potter.

152
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,389
Sirius.

153
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,589
This is very, very peculiar.

154
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,184
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,193
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,393
Show him. He'II find out soon enough.

157
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,190
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,383
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

159
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,585
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,988
Why?

161
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,991
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

162
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,184
No one in their right mind
could believe that...

163
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,987
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

164
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,992
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,589
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

166
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,194
The last time Voldemort gained power...

167
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,385
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,393
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

169
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,790
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,588
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

171
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,787
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.

172
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,590
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,185
He's been recruiting heavily,
and we've been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,587
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.

175
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,189
We believe...

176
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,591
...Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,192
Sirius.

178
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,590
Something he didn't have last time.

179
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,391
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,393
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,392
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.

182
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,587
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,991
Harry.

184
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,184
You are hereby expelled.

185
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,590
Before the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,791
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,587
Ingenious, these Muggles.

188
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,789
Here we are.

189
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,790
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.

190
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,590
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,392
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,585
Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody for Daily Prophet?

193
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,184
Dumbledore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?

194
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,990
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

195
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,586
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,787
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,590
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,388
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?

199
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,584
In five minutes.

200
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,188
Department of Mysteries.

201
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,187
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

202
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,794
Yes, but we must be...

203
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,390
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

204
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,188
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.

205
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,784
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

206
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,586
Yes?

207
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,987
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

208
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,184
Good luck, Harry.

209
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,994
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...

210
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,992
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

211
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,584
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

212
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,785
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag...

213
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,586
Witness for the defense.

214
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,990
Albus Percival Wulfric...

215
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,584
...Brian Dumbledore.

216
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,990
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...

217
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,594
...had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

218
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,991
But by a happy mistake,
I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.

219
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,383
The charges?

220
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,994
The charges against the accused
are as follows:

221
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,786
"That he did knowingly...

222
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,384
...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...

223
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,392
...produce a Patronus Charm...

224
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,585
...in the presence of a Muggle."

225
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,990
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

226
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,390
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

227
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,392
...while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

228
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,790
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...

229
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,587
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

230
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,784
Dementors?

231
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,392
In Little Whinging?

232
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,789
That's quite clever.

233
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,190
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?

234
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,384
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

235
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,994
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.

236
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,187
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

237
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,591
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

238
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,583
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.

239
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,784
Please describe the attack.

240
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,184
What did they look like?

241
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,991
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

242
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,392
Not the boys. The Dementors.

243
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,393
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

244
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,983
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

245
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,390
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

246
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,383
Now, look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...

247
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,188
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

248
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,986
I don't think anyone would believe...

249
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,390
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

250
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,192
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.

251
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,593
Dementors are, after all,
under the control of the Ministry of Magic.

252
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,787
And it's so silly of me,
but it sounded for a moment as though...

253
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,793
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

254
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,587
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary...

255
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,787
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

256
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,190
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

257
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,988
...and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

258
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,789
Of course, there is someone...

259
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,792
...who might be behind the attack.

260
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,785
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

261
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,191
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

262
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,590
He is not back.

263
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,194
In the matter of Harry Potter...

264
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,794
...the law clearly states...

265
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,191
...that magic may be used before Muggles
in life-threatening situations.

266
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,192
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

267
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,385
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

268
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,790
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

269
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,193
Those in favor of conviction?

270
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,393
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?

271
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,994
Cleared of all charges.

272
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,584
Professor.

273
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,585
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

274
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,387
You'II blow the entire operation.

275
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,594
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you...

276
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,785
I had to see you off, didn't I?

277
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,394
What's life without a little risk?

278
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,789
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

279
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,586
Don't worry about me.

280
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,993
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

281
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,990
Original Order of the Phoenix.

282
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,786
Marlene McKinnon.

283
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,587
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.

284
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,184
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

285
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,986
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

286
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,592
Neville's parents.

287
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,787
They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.

288
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,992
It's been 14 years.

289
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,785
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

290
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,785
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?

291
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,190
It feels like it did before.

292
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,984
You keep it.

293
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,790
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.

294
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,191
I'II see you at the train.

295
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,794
Bye-bye, darling.

296
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,991
I love you.

297
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,384
Hold my hand, lovey.

298
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,584
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

299
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,591
Bye.

300
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,392
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

301
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,992
Better enjoy it while you can.

302
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,788
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

303
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,991
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

304
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,989
It's only Malfoy.

305
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,384
What'd you expect?

306
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,388
Hi, guys.

307
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,584
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

308
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,584
What is it?

309
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,788
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

310
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,787
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

311
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,394
It's pulling itself, like always.

312
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,594
You're not going mad.

313
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,194
I can see them too.

314
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,992
You're just as sane as I am.

315
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,594
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

316
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,194
Luna Lovegood.

317
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,987
What an interesting necklace.

318
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,787
It's a charm, actually.

319
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,584
Keeps away the Nargles.

320
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,591
Hungry.

321
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,194
I hope there's pudding.

322
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,593
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

323
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,191
Good evening, children.

324
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,787
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

325
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,792
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

326
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,394
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

327
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,393
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

328
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,593
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

329
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,785
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

330
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,987
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

331
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,593
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

332
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,387
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

333
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,589
Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.

334
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,988
And how lovely to see all your bright...

335
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,992
...happy faces smiling up at me.

336
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,188
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

337
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,794
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

338
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,992
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

339
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,791
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

340
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,984
Although each headmaster...

341
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,393
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

342
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,594
...progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

343
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,588
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...

344
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,184
...perfect what can be perfected...

345
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,992
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

346
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,387
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

347
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,190
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

348
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,589
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

349
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,593
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

350
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,786
Dean, Seamus.

351
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,189
- Good holiday?
- All right.

352
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,987
Better than Seamus', anyway.

353
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,989
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.

354
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,584
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

355
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,990
The Daily Prophet's been saying
a lot of things about you and Dumbledore.

356
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,388
What, your mum believes them?

357
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,391
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.

358
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,585
I guess you should read the Prophet, then,
like your stupid mother.

359
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,184
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.

360
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,589
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

361
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,785
Do you believe the rubbish he's come out
with about You-Know-Who?

362
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,984
Yeah. I do.

363
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,789
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?

364
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,794
- You all right?
- Fine.

365
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,985
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

366
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,187
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

367
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,990
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.

368
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,192
Harry.

369
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,994
Bring it over here. Over here.

370
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,790
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

371
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,986
Good morning, children.

372
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,588
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

373
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,194
O- W-Ls.

374
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,785
More commonly known as OWLs.

375
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,985
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

376
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,586
Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.

377
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,383
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

378
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,584
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...

379
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,184
...you will be following
a carefully structured, Ministry-approved...

380
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,385
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

381
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,787
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

382
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,392
Using spells?

383
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,188
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

384
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,992
We're not gonna use magic?

385
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,983
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.

386
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,787
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.

387
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,190
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

388
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,594
It is the view of the Ministry...

389
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,387
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

390
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,391
...to get you through your examinations...

391
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,994
...which, after all,
is what school is all about.

392
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,787
And how's theory supposed to prepare us
for what's out there?

393
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,791
There is nothing out there, dear.

394
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,985
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

395
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,584
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.

396
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,190
Now, let me make this quite plain.

397
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,792
You have been told...

398
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,988
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.

399
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,188
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

400
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,792
Detention, Mr. Potter.

401
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,984
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

402
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,594
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

403
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,784
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

404
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,791
Enough!

405
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,586
Enough.

406
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,390
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

407
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,192
Come in.

408
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,189
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

409
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,986
Sit.

410
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,588
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.

411
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,591
No, not with your quill.

412
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,388
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.

413
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,591
Now...

414
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,189
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."

415
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,784
How many times?

416
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,783
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

417
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,986
You haven't given me any ink.

418
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,991
Oh, you won't need any ink.

419
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,591
Yes?

420
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,788
- Nothing.
- That's right.

421
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,193
Because you know, deep down...

422
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,589
...you deserve to be punished.

423
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,794
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

424
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,391
Go on.

425
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,989
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

426
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,592
Get out of class whenever you like.

427
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,787
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

428
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,588
Care for another?

429
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,194
- I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.
- Please.

430
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,590
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

431
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,386
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

432
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,188
Hermione, you're honestly
the most wonderful person I've ever met.

433
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,785
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

434
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,589
What's wrong with your hand?

435
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,591
Nothing.

436
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,589
The other hand.

437
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,391
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

438
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,584
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.

439
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,784
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

440
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,394
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

441
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,791
- Lf the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

442
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,394
Harry, you've got to report this.

443
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,984
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.

444
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,185
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.

445
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,194
You don't understand.

446
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,594
Then help us to.

447
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,389
Dear Padfoot...

448
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,186
...I hope you're all right.

449
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,183
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

450
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,183
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

451
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,188
I know you, of all people,
will understand.

452
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,994
Hello, Harry Potter.

453
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,983
- Your feet. Aren't they cold?
- Bit.

454
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,791
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

455
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,190
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

456
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,793
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

457
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,386
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

458
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,784
Different.

459
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,589
But why can't the others see them?

460
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,593
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.

461
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,594
So you've known someone
who's died, then?

462
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,784
My mum.

463
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,590
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

464
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,990
...and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.

465
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,787
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

466
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,984
Yes, it was rather horrible.

467
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,791
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.

468
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,385
We both believe you, by the way.

469
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,792
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back,
and you fought him...

470
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,985
...and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.

471
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,187
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.

472
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,191
I don't think that's true.

473
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,985
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.

474
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,389
What do you mean?

475
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,584
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...

476
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,184
...I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...

477
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,385
...because if it's just you alone...

478
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,387
...you're not as much of a threat.

479
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,783
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

480
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,192
Harry.

481
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,986
Can I join you?

482
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,392
Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?

483
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,187
I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...

484
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,591
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

485
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,386
So silly of me, but it sounds...

486
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,393
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

487
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,788
...Minerva.

488
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,385
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.

489
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,994
I am sorry, dear.

490
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,390
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

491
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,392
...and by extension, the minister himself.

492
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,186
I am a tolerant woman...

493
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,593
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

494
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,984
Disloyalty.

495
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,993
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

496
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,993
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

497
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,391
What's happened to Dumbledore?

498
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,994
Having already revolutionized...

499
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,992
...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...

500
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,993
...Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...

501
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,385
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

502
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,589
Just one question, dear.

503
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,185
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?

504
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,188
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

505
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,384
Yes.

506
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,585
But you were unsuccessful?

507
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,987
Obviously.

508
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,393
Could you please predict something
for me?

509
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,186
I'm sorry?

510
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,387
Move those mouths.

511
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,184
One teensy little prophecy?

512
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,191
Pity.

513
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,589
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.

514
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,989
Yes, I do. Something dark.

515
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,790
You are in grave danger.

516
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,984
Lovely.

517
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,384
Cho. What's going on?

518
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,187
It's Professor Trelawney.

519
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,784
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.

520
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,190
Hogwarts is my home.

521
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,789
You can't do this.

522
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,387
Actually, I can.

523
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,792
Something you'd like to say?

524
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,792
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.

525
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,984
There...

526
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,783
Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?

527
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,994
Sybil, dear. This way.

528
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,991
Thank you.

529
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,593
Dumbledore, may I remind you
that under the terms...

530
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,785
...of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister...

531
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,985
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

532
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,584
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

533
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,184
That power remains with the headmaster.

534
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,186
For now.

535
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,984
Don't you all have studying to do?

536
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,592
Professor.

537
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,392
Professor?

538
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,187
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

539
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,794
Professor Dumbledore.

540
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,994
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

541
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,188
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.

542
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,191
She's taking over the entire school.

543
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,990
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

544
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,787
Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...

545
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,792
...that these disappearances
are the work...

546
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,588
...of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.

547
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,386
Harry.

548
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,584
Sirius.

549
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,394
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

550
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,392
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

551
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,391
Training you to kill half-breeds?

552
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,585
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

553
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,787
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

554
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,188
Combat?

555
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,192
What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?

556
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,588
That's exactly what he thinks.

557
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,787
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

558
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,384
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

559
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,188
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

560
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,192
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.

561
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,794
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

562
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,191
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

563
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,984
Voldemort is on the move.

564
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,991
Well, what can we do?

565
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,388
Someone's coming.

566
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,789
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

567
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,193
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.

568
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,387
He really is out there, isn't he?

569
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,785
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.

570
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,987
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how,
we need someone who will.

571
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,387
Harry.

572
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,389
This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

573
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,583
I'm a nutter, remember?

574
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:17,185
Look on the bright side:
You can't be any worse than old toad face.

575
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,988
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

576
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,389
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

577
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,994
Just a couple of people.

578
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,191
Lovely spot.

579
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,384
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

580
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,187
Matey, come back here.

581
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,192
Hi.

582
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,987
So you all know why we're here.

583
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,786
We need a teacher.

584
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,189
A proper teacher.

585
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,385
One who's had experience
defending themselves against the Dark Arts.

586
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,186
- Why?
- Why?

587
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,384
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.

588
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,186
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

589
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,384
So Dumbledore says because he says.

590
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,187
The point is, where's the proof?

591
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,390
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

592
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,588
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

593
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,990
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.

594
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,185
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

595
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,791
Yes.

596
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,988
I've seen it.

597
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,594
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.

598
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,793
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.

599
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,188
It's true.

600
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,385
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

601
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,987
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

602
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,786
Wait.

603
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,385
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

604
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,984
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.

605
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,788
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.

606
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,793
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

607
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,788
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.

608
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,590
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

609
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,591
But out there...

610
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,990
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...

611
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,993
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

612
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,384
You don't know what that's like.

613
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,589
You're right, Harry, we don't.

614
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,984
That's why we need your help.

615
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,390
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...

616
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,586
...Voldemort...

617
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,589
He's really back.

618
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,186
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...

619
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,588
...where Umbridge won't find out.

620
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,784
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

621
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,792
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

622
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,984
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

623
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,786
Who cares?

624
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,590
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?

625
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,387
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?

626
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,188
Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.

627
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,986
What's that?

628
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,185
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?

629
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,192
Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...

630
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,192
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

631
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,988
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no chance she can find us.

632
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,389
Will do, Harry.

633
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,193
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

634
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,988
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

635
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,992
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

636
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,787
You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.

637
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,983
The what?

638
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,594
It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.

639
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,990
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

640
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,594
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

641
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,787
So say you really needed the toilet...

642
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,190
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.

643
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:23,388
It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.

644
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,391
Expelliarmus.

645
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,392
I'm hopeless.

646
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,587
You're just flourishing your wand too much.
Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

647
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:52,193
You will please copy
the approved text four times...

648
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,385
...to ensure maximum retention.

649
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,188
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

650
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,589
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.

651
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,592
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.

652
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,989
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

653
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,993
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

654
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,591
Stupefy!

655
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,390
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

656
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,389
Don't worry. I'II go easy on you.

657
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,994
Thanks, Ronald.

658
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,189
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

659
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,385
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

660
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,994
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

661
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,986
Stupefy.

662
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,189
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

663
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:19,183
I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?

664
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,792
It was completely intentional.

665
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,190
Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?

666
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,191
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.

667
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,589
Expelliarmus.

668
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,585
Very good. Keep your concentration.

669
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,991
Great.

670
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,784
A little higher.

671
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,590
I'm okay. I'm okay.

672
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,392
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

673
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,790
Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad
for extra credit...

674
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,587
...may sign up
in the high inquisitor's office.

675
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,784
Diminuendo.

676
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:59,191
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

677
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,384
Believing in yourself.

678
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,584
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

679
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,192
Think of it this way.

680
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,387
Every great wizard in history
has started out...

681
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,393
...as nothing more
than what we are now: Students.

682
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,790
If they can do it, why not us?

683
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,184
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.

684
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,586
Expelliarmus.

685
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,591
Expelliarmus.

686
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,186
Reducto.

687
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,592
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

688
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,387
Expelliarmus.

689
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,194
Expelliarmus.

690
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,188
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

691
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,384
So that's it for this lesson.

692
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,984
Now, we're not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.

693
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,992
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.

694
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,788
And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.

695
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,392
Well done, mate.

696
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,391
Thanks.

697
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,192
See you after Christmas.

698
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,194
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

699
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,992
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

700
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,987
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

701
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,389
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

702
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,186
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

703
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,987
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

704
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,389
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

705
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,187
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...

706
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,192
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?

707
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,790
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

708
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,587
Yeah. I'm okay.

709
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,985
Anyway, it's worth it.

710
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,184
It's just, learning all this...

711
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,790
...makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it...

712
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,985
Cedric did know this stuff.

713
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,787
He was really good.

714
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,185
It's just, Voldemort was better.

715
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,189
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

716
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,190
I've never been able
to stun anything before.

717
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,584
Mistletoe.

718
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,789
Probably full of Nargles, though.

719
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,384
What are Nargles?

720
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,784
No idea.

721
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,994
Well, how was it?

722
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,191
Wet.

723
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,191
I mean, she was sort of crying.

724
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,384
That bad at it, are you?

725
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,585
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

726
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,989
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.

727
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,594
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.

728
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,790
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

729
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,984
Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...

730
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,992
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

731
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,390
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

732
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,587
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

733
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:35,384
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.

734
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,984
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...

735
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,784
Harry.

736
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,184
Voldemort may be after something.

737
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,590
Something he didn't have last time.

738
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,786
Harry.

739
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,386
Harry.

740
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,190
In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...

741
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,986
...or looking down at the scene?

742
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,390
Neither. It was like I...

743
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,584
Will you please just tell me
what's happening?

744
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,989
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.

745
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,389
Make sure he's found
by the right people.

746
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,186
- Sir.
- Phineas.

747
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,589
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.

748
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,194
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...

749
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:11,387
...and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.

750
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,392
They've got him, Albus.
It was close, but they think he'll make it.

751
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,994
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

752
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,991
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...

753
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,786
Look at me!

754
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,187
What's happening to me?

755
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,986
You wished to see me, headmaster?

756
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,188
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.

757
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,590
Otherwise, we'II all be vulnerable.

758
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,192
It appears there's a connection...

759
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,589
...between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.

760
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:58,991
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

761
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,992
Pray he remains ignorant.

762
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,584
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

763
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:09,991
...he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

764
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,991
...unhinge it.

765
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,390
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

766
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,584
...to invade the minds of his victims...

767
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,787
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

768
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,990
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...

769
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,187
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

770
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,986
...kill them.

771
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,789
Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...

772
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,384
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

773
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:44,383
In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

774
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,790
You will attempt to resist.

775
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,791
Prepare yourself.

776
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,586
Legilimens.

777
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,787
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

778
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,184
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

779
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,394
Here we go.

780
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,994
Daddy's back.

781
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,184
Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.

782
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:47,990
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...

783
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,389
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

784
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,789
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

785
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,189
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

786
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:01,387
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

787
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,392
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

788
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,391
Oh, Harry, Harry.

789
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,994
There you are.

790
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,589
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

791
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,591
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

792
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,591
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

793
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,386
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

794
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,788
Fred? George?

795
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,394
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

796
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,789
To Mr. Harry Potter...

797
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,590
...without whom I would not be here.

798
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,789
- Harry.
- Harry.

799
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,586
Harry.

800
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,594
That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.

801
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,387
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

802
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,985
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.

803
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,791
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

804
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,586
No more than usual, Ron.

805
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,989
I don't know why...

806
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,785
Nasty brat, standing there
as bold as brass.

807
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,385
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

808
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,790
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.

809
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,394
- Lf my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

810
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,187
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!

811
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,384
Of course, master.

812
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:21,383
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

813
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,389
Sorry about that.

814
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,393
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

815
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,994
Not to me, anyway.

816
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,191
What, you grew up here?

817
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,589
This is my parents' house.

818
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,991
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

819
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,188
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.

820
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,792
This is the Black family tree.

821
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,184
My deranged cousin.

822
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,987
I hated the lot of them.

823
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,188
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

824
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,787
My mother did that after I ran away.

825
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,789
Charming woman.

826
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,584
I was 16.

827
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,791
Where did you go?

828
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,986
Round your dad's.

829
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,792
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

830
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,385
I see him so much in you, Harry.

831
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,187
You are so very much alike.

832
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,789
I'm not so sure.

833
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,186
Sirius, when I was...

834
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:40,383
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.

835
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,984
I was the snake.

836
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,192
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...

837
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,785
...there was a moment
when I wanted to...

838
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,390
This connection
between me and Voldemort.

839
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:02,587
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?

840
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:07,990
I just feel so angry all the time.

841
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,585
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

842
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,593
...something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?

843
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,184
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.

844
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,190
You're not a bad person.

845
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:31,190
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

846
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,986
You understand?

847
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,383
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

848
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:44,190
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.

849
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,984
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.

850
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,187
That's who we really are.

851
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,389
Harry, time to go.

852
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,791
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

853
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,791
You'II see.

854
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,186
Come on.

855
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,783
Really?

856
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,587
Harry. Harry.

857
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,989
Hagrid's back.

858
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,589
I'm sorry.

859
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,990
I will say this one last time.

860
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,389
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.

861
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,585
I told you. I've been away for me health.

862
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,787
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

863
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:24,988
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.

864
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,994
If I were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.

865
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,584
In fact, I mightn't bother
unpacking at all.

866
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:53,784
This is top-secret, right?

867
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,594
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.

868
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,591
Giants?

869
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,189
You found them?

870
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:04,591
Well, they're not that hard to find,
to be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

871
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,792
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

872
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,985
But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.

873
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,384
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

874
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:17,188
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

875
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,589
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

876
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,991
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I suppose.

877
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,786
And they did this to you?

878
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,984
Not exactly, no.

879
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,391
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.

880
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,589
It's changing out there.

881
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,784
Just like last time.

882
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,784
There's a storm coming, Harry.

883
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,384
We'd all best be ready when she does.

884
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,385
We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...

885
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,187
...in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.

886
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,784
And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.

887
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,587
We strongly suspect...

888
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,791
...that the breakout was engineered...

889
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,987
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

890
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,585
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

891
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:03,190
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.

892
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,784
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.

893
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,985
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.

894
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,786
Harry.

895
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,189
I wanted to apologize.

896
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:29,387
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

897
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:35,589
So, what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.

898
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,784
Neville?

899
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,384
Fourteen years ago...

900
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,791
...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...

901
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,384
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

902
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,393
She tortured them for information...

903
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,994
...but they never gave in.

904
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,992
I'm quite proud to be their son.

905
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,587
But I'm not sure
I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.

906
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:30,385
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.

907
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:37,384
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

908
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,984
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.

909
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,786
George, your turn now.

910
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,387
Expecto Patronum.

911
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,190
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...

912
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,988
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

913
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,786
Wow, that was really good.

914
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,586
Fantastic, Ginny.

915
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,593
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

916
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,387
So focus, Luna.

917
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,186
Think of the happiest thing you can.

918
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,191
Expecto Patronum.

919
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,987
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

920
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,790
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.

921
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,792
Expecto Patronum.

922
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,392
I'II make short work of this.

923
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,594
Bombarda Maxima.

924
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,186
Get them.

925
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,792
Been watching them for weeks.

926
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,984
And see, "Dumbledore's Army"...

927
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,187
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

928
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,991
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

929
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,592
...never fooled us for a minute.

930
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,784
We saw your lies for what they were:

931
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,588
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.

932
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,783
Naturally.

933
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,394
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.

934
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,984
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...

935
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,790
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

936
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,587
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.

937
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,990
And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.

938
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,991
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.

939
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,594
If we hurry,
we should still make the morning edition.

940
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:12,390
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...

941
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,186
...to Azkaban...

942
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,988
...to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.

943
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,390
I thought we might hit this little snag.

944
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,788
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to...

945
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,392
What was the phrase?

946
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,992
Come quietly.

947
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,991
Well, I can tell you this:

948
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,389
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.

949
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,186
Enough of this.

950
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,792
Take him.

951
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,791
Well, you may not like him, minister...

952
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,394
...but you can't deny...

953
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,585
...Dumbledore has got style.

954
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:27,785
Boys and girls are not permitted
to be within eight inches of each other.

955
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,190
Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

956
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:36,183
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

957
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:40,990
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

958
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,784
Harry.

959
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,190
You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.

960
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,987
Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.

961
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,584
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

962
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,784
Yeah, we talked you into it.

963
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,189
Yeah, but I agreed.

964
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:14,785
I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.

965
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,987
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

966
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:23,587
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

967
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,387
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

968
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,984
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

969
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,989
To go it alone.

970
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,784
Hagrid.

971
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,194
Any idea where he's taking us?

972
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:50,784
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

973
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,787
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

974
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,792
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

975
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,589
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

976
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,784
...they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.

977
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,586
Hagrid, what's going on?

978
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,989
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

979
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,188
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...

980
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,385
...I'll likely be getting the sack
any day now.

981
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:25,393
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

982
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,984
Grawpy.

983
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,394
Down here, you great buffoon.

984
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,984
Grawpy.

985
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,384
Brought you some company.

986
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,989
I couldn't just leave him, because...

987
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,786
Because he's my brother.

988
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,188
Blimey.

989
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,191
Well, half brother, really.

990
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:09,786
He's completely harmless, just like I said.
Little high-spirited, is all.

991
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,789
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

992
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:16,189
We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?

993
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,589
That's your new friend, Hermione.

994
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,386
Grawpy.

995
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,586
Grawp.

996
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,584
Put me down.

997
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,584
Now.

998
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,192
You all right?

999
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,991
Fine.

1000
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,184
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1001
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,192
I think you've got an admirer.

1002
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,594
You just stay away from her, all right?

1003
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,185
He gets his own food and all.

1004
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,384
It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.

1005
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,594
You will look after him, won't you?

1006
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,785
I'm the only family he's got.

1007
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,589
Feeling sentimental?

1008
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:04,193
- That's private.
- Not to me.

1009
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,988
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1010
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,985
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.

1011
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,585
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1012
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,384
You're just like your father.

1013
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,391
Lazy, arrogant.

1014
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,584
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

1015
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,387
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

1016
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,391
Control your emotions.

1017
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,790
Discipline your mind.

1018
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,592
Legilimens.

1019
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,183
Harry.

1020
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,384
Sirius.

1021
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,992
I may vomit.

1022
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,592
Stop it.

1023
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,794
Is this what you call control?

1024
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,985
We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.

1025
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,788
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1026
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,791
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1027
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,793
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.

1028
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,985
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn't fair.

1029
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,993
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1030
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,584
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1031
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,991
- Legilimens.
- Protego.

1032
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,392
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1033
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,584
Snape. Expelliarmus.

1034
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,591
Nice one, James.

1035
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,989
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.

1036
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,991
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1037
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,787
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

1038
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,189
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1039
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,792
Enough.

1040
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,384
Enough.

1041
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,587
Your lessons are at an end.

1042
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,783
L...

1043
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,588
Get out.

1044
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,584
- What's your name?
- Michael.

1045
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,591
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

1046
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,785
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1047
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,791
It's fading already.

1048
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:30,988
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

1049
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,187
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1050
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:44,387
...naughty children
deserve to be punished.

1051
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,188
You know, George...

1052
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:51,988
...I've always felt ourfutures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.

1053
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,790
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1054
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,384
All right, professor!

1055
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,584
Here you go.

1056
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,389
Ready when you are.

1057
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,185
I need that prophecy.

1058
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,589
You'II have to kill me.

1059
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:15,385
Oh, I will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.

1060
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,584
Crucio.

1061
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,789
Crucio.

1062
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,592
Sirius.

1063
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:34,783
Harry, are you sure?

1064
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,189
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.

1065
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,191
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

1066
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,384
I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.

1067
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,391
Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.

1068
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,585
Something he didn't have the last time,
in the Department of Mysteries.

1069
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,194
Harry, please, just listen.

1070
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,389
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?

1071
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,385
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1072
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:59,790
What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?

1073
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,793
Hermione,
he's the only family I've got left.

1074
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,192
What do we do?

1075
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,786
We'II have to use the Floo Network.

1076
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,791
Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.

1077
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,984
Not all of them.

1078
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,991
Alohomora.

1079
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:29,986
Alert the Order if you can.

1080
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,390
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.

1081
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:37,188
When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.

1082
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:40,385
That you are.

1083
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,790
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.

1084
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,184
You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you?

1085
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,191
- No.
- Liar.

1086
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:55,192
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

1087
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:58,784
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1088
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,392
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1089
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:03,392
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.

1090
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:06,984
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1091
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,992
Unless you wish to poison him...

1092
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,790
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1093
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,189
I cannot help you.

1094
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,184
He's got Padfoot.

1095
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:27,388
He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.

1096
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,584
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1097
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,591
What is he talking about, Snape?

1098
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:39,994
No idea.

1099
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,784
Very well.

1100
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,794
You give me no choice, Potter.

1101
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,792
As this is an issue of Ministry security...

1102
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,394
...you leave me with...

1103
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,994
...no alternative.

1104
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,384
The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.

1105
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,389
That's illegal.

1106
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:04,393
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.

1107
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,991
Tell her, Harry!

1108
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,791
Tell me what?

1109
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,789
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1110
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,184
...I will.

1111
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,589
Where what is?

1112
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,787
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1113
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,786
How much further?

1114
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,984
Not far.

1115
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:41,387
It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.

1116
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,592
What are you doing?

1117
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,784
Lmprovising.

1118
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,584
Well?

1119
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,794
Where is this weapon?

1120
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,787
There isn't one, is there?

1121
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,394
You were trying to trick me.

1122
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,984
You know...

1123
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,189
...I really hate children.

1124
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:41,390
You have no business here, centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.

1125
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,186
Lower your weapons.

1126
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:50,593
I warn you, under the law,
as creatures of near-human intelligence...

1127
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,192
Protego.

1128
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,792
How dare you?

1129
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,791
Filthy half-breed.

1130
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,592
Incarcerous.

1131
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,387
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1132
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:17,383
Now, enough. I will have order.

1133
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,794
You filthy animal.

1134
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:30,792
Do you know who I am?

1135
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,792
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1136
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:36,189
No, he doesn't understand.

1137
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,390
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1138
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,391
I'm sorry, professor.

1139
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,391
But I must not tell lies.

1140
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,389
What are you doing?

1141
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:55,587
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1142
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,194
Let me go!

1143
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:02,191
Thank you, Grawp.

1144
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:05,988
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1145
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:16,984
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1146
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,184
Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.

1147
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:22,192
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1148
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,584
That was clever, Ron.

1149
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,189
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.

1150
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:29,589
So how are we getting to London?

1151
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:34,393
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1152
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:37,194
...but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.

1153
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,385
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.

1154
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,994
Or was that all just words to you?

1155
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,988
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.

1156
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,787
So how are we going to get to London?

1157
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:58,187
We fly, of course.

1158
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,194
Department of Mysteries.

1159
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,384
This is it.

1160
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,387
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.

1161
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,391
Ninety-four.

1162
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,592
Ninety-five.

1163
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,185
- He should be here.
- Harry.

1164
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,191
It's got your name on it.

1165
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:44,390
The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

1166
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:47,194
And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...

1167
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:50,385
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

1168
01:43:55,200 --> 01:44:00,991
For neithercan live
while the other survives.

1169
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,392
Harry.

1170
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,592
Where's Sirius?

1171
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:20,993
You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...

1172
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:25,794
...and reality.

1173
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:31,793
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1174
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,392
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1175
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,994
If you do anything to us, I'II break it.

1176
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:40,794
He knows how to play.

1177
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:44,588
Itty, bitty baby.

1178
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:46,192
Potter.

1179
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,191
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1180
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:51,192
Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?

1181
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,589
Better, now they're about to be avenged.

1182
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,783
Now, let's everybody just calm down...

1183
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,392
...shall we?

1184
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,994
All we want is that prophecy.

1185
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,184
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?

1186
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,384
You dare speak his name?

1187
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:11,986
You filthy half-blood!

1188
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,992
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?

1189
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:21,793
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1190
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:24,985
Which is lucky for you, really.

1191
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,184
Haven't you always wondered...

1192
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:35,786
...what was the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1193
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,594
Why he was unable to kill you...

1194
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,592
...when you were just an infant?

1195
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:47,388
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1196
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:52,590
All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.

1197
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,589
All you have to do...

1198
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,784
...is give it to me.

1199
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:01,588
Then I can show you everything.

1200
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:11,584
I've waited 14 years.

1201
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,386
I know.

1202
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:17,192
I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.

1203
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,986
Stupefy.

1204
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,592
Levicorpus.

1205
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,384
Petrificus Totalus.

1206
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,584
Well done, Neville.

1207
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,191
Stupefy.

1208
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,992
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

1209
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:10,589
Stupefy.

1210
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:19,987
Reducto.

1211
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,394
Get back to the door.

1212
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:15,583
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?

1213
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,389
The voices.

1214
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,789
Can you tell what they're saying?

1215
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,594
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1216
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,591
Let's get out of here.

1217
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,591
I hear them too.

1218
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,185
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1219
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,191
Please, Harry.

1220
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,789
Get behind me.

1221
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,587
Did you actually believe...

1222
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:36,390
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...

1223
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:41,986
...that children stood a chance
against us?

1224
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:48,987
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1225
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,185
Give me the prophecy now...

1226
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:59,785
...or watch your friends die.

1227
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,386
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1228
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,390
Get away from my godson.

1229
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,387
Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.

1230
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,391
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1231
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:17,585
You've done beautifully.

1232
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,386
Now, let me take it from here.

1233
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:20,992
Black.

1234
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,788
Expelliarmus!

1235
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:49,791
Nice one, James.

1236
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,991
Avada Kedavra.

1237
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:19,587
No. No.

1238
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,185
I killed Sirius Black.

1239
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,989
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.

1240
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:02,385
You've got to mean it, Harry.

1241
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:06,587
She killed him. She deserves it.

1242
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:13,384
You know the spell, Harry.

1243
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,984
Do it.

1244
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:36,190
So weak.

1245
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:45,385
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.

1246
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:47,186
The Aurors are on their way.

1247
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:51,785
By which time I shall be gone, and you...

1248
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:55,394
...shall be dead.

1249
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,989
You've lost, old man.

1250
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:26,192
Harry.

1251
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:31,591
So weak.

1252
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:34,194
So vulnerable.

1253
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:39,392
Look at me.

1254
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:45,387
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1255
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:48,392
It's how you are not.

1256
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:54,591
Harry?

1257
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,991
You're the weak one...

1258
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:31,585
...and you'll never know
love or friendship.

1259
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,590
And I feel sorry for you.

1260
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:03,193
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1261
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:08,986
And you will lose everything.

1262
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:24,784
He's back.

1263
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:30,986
I know how you feel, Harry.

1264
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,184
No, you don't.

1265
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,388
It's my fault.

1266
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:43,188
No, the fault is mine.

1267
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:45,386
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1268
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:48,984
...before Voldemort made the connection
between you.

1269
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:53,387
I thought by distancing myself from you,
as I have done all year...

1270
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:58,986
...he'd be less tempted,
and therefore you might be more protected.

1271
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,788
The prophecy said:

1272
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:09,191
"Neither one can live
while the other one survives."

1273
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:16,394
It means one of us
is gonna have to kill the other, in the end.

1274
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:19,591
Yes.

1275
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:21,192
Why didn't you tell me?

1276
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:24,988
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1277
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,787
The same reason your friends saved you.

1278
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,584
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1279
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:34,990
...I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.

1280
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:38,394
I cared too much about you.

1281
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:03,989
How come you're not at the feast?

1282
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,585
Lost all my possessions.
Apparently people have been hiding them.

1283
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:09,783
That's awful.

1284
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:11,586
Oh, it's all good fun.

1285
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:15,184
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1286
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:17,987
Do you want any help finding them?

1287
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:23,988
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1288
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,184
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?

1289
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:33,986
That's all right.

1290
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,184
Anyway, my mum always said...

1291
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:40,591
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1292
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,788
If not always in the way we expect.

1293
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:50,785
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1294
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:27,392
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1295
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:29,584
What's that?

1296
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:32,387
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...

1297
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:35,585
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1298
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,591
Yeah?

1299
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:41,587
Something worth fighting for.

<font color="#696969">Horace?</font>

36
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,075
<font color="#696969">Horace?</font>

37
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,667
<font color="#696969">Merlin's beard!</font>

38
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:13,107
<font color="#696969">No need to disfigure me, Albus.</font>

39
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:16,965
<font color="#696969">Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.</font>

40
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:22,283
<font color="#696969">It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?</font>

41
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:25,202
<font color="#696969">Dragon's blood.</font>

42
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,747
<font color="#696969">~ Oh.
~ Oh, yes, introductions.</font>

43
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,917
<font color="#696969">Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine....</font>

44
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,481
<font color="#696969">....Horace Slughorn.</font>

45
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,150
<font color="#696969">Horace....</font>

46
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:39,173
<font color="#696969">....well, you know who this is.</font>

47
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,988
<font color="#696969">Harry Potter.</font>

48
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:46,576
<font color="#696969">What's with all the theatrics, Horace?</font>

49
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:49,183
<font color="#696969">You weren't, by any chance, waiting for someone else?</font>

50
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:51,893
<font color="#696969">Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.</font>

51
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,751
<font color="#696969">All right, the Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for 
over a year.</font>

52
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,315
<font color="#696969">Do you know what that's like?</font>

53
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,173
<font color="#696969">You can only say no so many times, so I never stay anywhere more 
than a week.</font>

54
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,675
<font color="#696969">Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.</font>

55
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:08,784
<font color="#696969">Well, I think we should put it back in order for them, don't you? Mind.</font>

56
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,276
<font color="#696969">That was fun.</font>

57
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:49,238
<font color="#696969">~ Do you mind if I use the loo?
~ No, of course.</font>

58
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:53,200
<font color="#696969">Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.</font>

59
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:58,935
<font color="#696969">The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.</font>

60
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:09,361
<font color="#696969">You're very like your father.</font>

61
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,428
<font color="#696969">~ Except for the eyes. You have your....
~ My mother's eyes. Yeah.</font>

62
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:17,285
<font color="#696969">Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.</font>

63
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,726
<font color="#696969">Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.</font>

64
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,541
<font color="#696969">One of my best friends is Muggle-born. Best in our year.</font>

65
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,731
<font color="#696969">Please don't think I'm prejudiced. No, no.</font>

66
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:30,110
<font color="#696969">Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.</font>

67
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:32,091
<font color="#696969">Right at the front.</font>

68
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:43,560
<font color="#696969">All mine. Each and every one.</font>

69
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:45,749
<font color="#696969">Ex-students, I mean.</font>

70
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:52,422
<font color="#696969">You recognize Barnabas Cuffe, editor of The Daily Prophet.</font>

71
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:55,759
<font color="#696969">Always takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion....</font>

72
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,218
<font color="#696969">....on the news of the day.</font>

73
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:01,076
<font color="#696969">Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.</font>

74
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:03,683
<font color="#696969">Free tickets whenever I want them.</font>

75
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,915
<font color="#696969">Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.</font>

76
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,147
<font color="#696969">Ah, yes.</font>

77
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,441
<font color="#696969">Regulus Black.</font>

78
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,611
<font color="#696969">You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.</font>

79
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,322
<font color="#696969">I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius.</font>

80
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,720
<font color="#696969">It's a shame. Talented boy.</font>

81
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:27,142
<font color="#696969">I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set.</font>

82
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,227
<font color="#696969">Horace?</font>

83
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:31,521
<font color="#696969">Do you mind if I take this?</font>

84
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:39,758
<font color="#696969">~ I do love knitting patterns.
~ Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?</font>

85
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:42,990
<font color="#696969">I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable.</font>

86
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:45,492
<font color="#696969">I would have considered it
a personal triumph....</font>

87
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:48,620
<font color="#696969">....had you consented to return to Hogwarts. Oh, well.</font>

88
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,748
<font color="#696969">You're like my friend Mr. Potter here, one of a kind.</font>

89
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:54,146
<font color="#696969">Well, bye-bye, Horace.</font>

90
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,440
<font color="#696969">Bye.</font>

91
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,994
<font color="#696969">All right. I'll do it.</font>

92
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:14,686
<font color="#696969">But I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water 
closet I had before.</font>

93
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:19,065
<font color="#696969">And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!</font>

94
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:22,506
<font color="#696969">They are indeed.</font>

95
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:27,823
<font color="#696969">Sir, exactly what was all that about?</font>

96
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:33,037
<font color="#696969">You are talented, famous and powerful. Everything Horace values.</font>

97
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:36,686
<font color="#696969">Professor Slughorn is gonna try to collect you, Harry.</font>

98
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,188
<font color="#696969">You would be his crowning jewel.</font>

99
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:44,923
<font color="#696969">That's why he's returning to Hogwarts. And it's crucial he should return.</font>

100
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:48,780
<font color="#696969">I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.</font>

101
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:53,994
<font color="#696969">She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.</font>

102
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:57,539
<font color="#696969">It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse.</font>

103
00:11:57,747 --> 00:12:01,396
<font color="#696969">Oh, you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.</font>

104
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:04,628
<font color="#696969">But, sir, what about Hedwig? And my trunk?</font>

105
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,444
<font color="#696969">Both are waiting for you.</font>

106
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:42,476
<font color="#696969">Hedwig.</font>

107
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,334
<font color="#696969">Mum?</font>

108
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:49,045
<font color="#696969">Ginny, what is it?</font>

109
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:51,756
<font color="#696969">I was only wondering
when Harry got here.</font>

110
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,092
<font color="#696969">~ What? Harry? Harry who?
~ Harry Potter, of course.</font>

111
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:58,429
<font color="#696969">I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?</font>

112
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:02,182
<font color="#696969">~ His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
~ No, dear, I seriously doubt that.</font>

113
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,457
<font color="#696969">Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?</font>

114
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:08,542
<font color="#696969">Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?</font>

115
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:11,774
<font color="#696969">Of course not. I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?</font>

116
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:14,381
<font color="#696969">~ Is that an owl?
~ You haven't seen him, have you?</font>

117
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:16,362
<font color="#696969">He's wandering about the house.</font>

118
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,239
<font color="#696969">~ Really?
~ Really.</font>

119
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,115
<font color="#696969">Harry!</font>

120
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,039
<font color="#696969">Harry!</font>

121
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:29,812
<font color="#696969">Hello.</font>

122
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,253
<font color="#696969">What a lovely surprise.</font>

123
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:37,632
<font color="#696969">Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?</font>

124
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,655
<font color="#696969">~ I didn't know. Dumbledore.
~ Oh, that man.</font>

125
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:43,053
<font color="#696969">But then, what would we do
without him?</font>

126
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:47,015
<font color="#696969">Got a bit of toothpaste.</font>

127
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,669
<font color="#696969">So when did you get here?</font>

128
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:57,546
<font color="#696969">A few days ago.</font>

129
00:13:58,484 --> 00:14:00,778
<font color="#696969">Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.</font>

130
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,844
<font color="#696969">Mum sort of lost it last week.</font>

131
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:07,972
<font color="#696969">Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.</font>

132
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,536
<font color="#696969">That it's too dangerous.</font>

133
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:12,560
<font color="#696969">~ Oh, come on.
~ She's not alone.</font>

134
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:16,001
<font color="#696969">Even my parents, and they're Muggles, know something bad's happening.</font>

135
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:20,067
<font color="#696969">Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy....</font>

136
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,778
<font color="#696969">....and it took a few days, but she came around.</font>

137
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:28,095
<font color="#696969">But this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?</font>

138
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:31,953
<font color="#696969">There's been a lot of talk recently that....</font>

139
00:14:32,683 --> 00:14:34,351
<font color="#696969">....Dumbledore's got a bit old.</font>

140
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,332
<font color="#696969">Rubbish! Well, he's only....</font>

141
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,105
<font color="#696969">What is he?</font>

142
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:41,441
<font color="#696969">Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.</font>

143
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:05,422
<font color="#696969">Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!</font>

144
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:06,986
<font color="#696969">The Dark Lord trusts him.</font>

145
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:10,739
<font color="#696969">~ The Dark Lord's mistaken.
~ Pfft.</font>

146
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:42,331
<font color="#696969">Run along, Wormtail.</font>

147
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:47,753
<font color="#696969">I know I ought not to be here.</font>

148
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,715
<font color="#696969">The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.</font>

149
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:54,530
<font color="#696969">If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.</font>

150
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:58,909
<font color="#696969">Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.</font>

151
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:06,729
<font color="#696969">As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.</font>

152
00:16:06,937 --> 00:16:08,084
<font color="#696969">You?</font>

153
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,525
<font color="#696969">The Dark Lord told you?</font>

154
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:14,653
<font color="#696969">Your sister doubts me.</font>

155
00:16:15,695 --> 00:16:18,510
<font color="#696969">Understandable. Over the years I've played my part well.</font>

156
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:22,368
<font color="#696969">So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.</font>

157
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:27,790
<font color="#696969">Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.</font>

158
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:29,875
<font color="#696969">I don't doubt you, Severus.</font>

159
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:33,212
<font color="#696969">You should be honored, Cissy. As should Draco.</font>

160
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:39,467
<font color="#696969">He's just a boy.</font>

161
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:43,325
<font color="#696969">I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.</font>

162
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:48,643
<font color="#696969">But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.</font>

163
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:53,335
<font color="#696969">~ Severus.
~ Swear to it.</font>

164
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,799
<font color="#696969">Make the Unbreakable Vow.</font>

165
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:06,785
<font color="#696969">It's just empty words.</font>

166
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:10,121
<font color="#696969">He'll give it his best effort.</font>

167
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,623
<font color="#696969">But when it matters most....</font>

168
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,462

has ordered Draco to perform?</font>

<font color="#696969">Hi, Ron.</font>

205
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:02,990
<font color="#696969">Hi.</font>

206
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:20,194
<font color="#696969">How are Fred and George
doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.</font>

207
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:22,904
<font color="#696969">Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.</font>

208
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:25,407
<font color="#696969">I reckon he's right.</font>

209
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,743
<font color="#696969">Oh, no.</font>

210
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,558
<font color="#696969">Everyone got their wands
from Ollivander's.</font>

211
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,425
<font color="#696969">Harry?</font>

212
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:49,283
<font color="#696969">Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy look like two people....</font>

215
00:22:39,594 --> 00:22:41,054
<font color="#696969">Quibbler.</font>

216
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:47,727
<font color="#696969">He's lovely. They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know.</font>

217
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:50,229
<font color="#696969">~ Quibbler?
~ Oh, please.</font>

218
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,982
<font color="#696969">~ What's a Wrackspurt?
~ They're invisible creatures.</font>

219
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:57,319
<font color="#696969">They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.</font>

220
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,404
<font color="#696969">Quibbler.</font>

221
00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:12,646
<font color="#696969">So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?</font>

222
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,522
<font color="#696969">And who were all those people?</font>

223
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,755
<font color="#696969">Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.</font>

224
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,840
<font color="#696969">Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.</font>

225
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:22,551
<font color="#696969">It's happened. He's one of them.</font>

226
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,219
<font color="#696969">One of what?</font>

227
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:28,389
<font color="#696969">Harry is under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.</font>

228
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:30,579
<font color="#696969">You're barking.</font>

229
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:32,873
<font color="#696969">What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?</font>

230
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:37,043
<font color="#696969">Well, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?</font>

231
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:39,129
<font color="#696969">It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.</font>

232
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:43,091
<font color="#696969">Look, his father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense.</font>

233
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:44,863
<font color="#696969">Hermione saw it with her own eyes.</font>

234
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:48,408
<font color="#696969">I told you, I don't know what I saw.</font>

235
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:51,640
<font color="#696969">I need some air.</font>

236
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:12,180
<font color="#696969">Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.</font>

237
00:24:32,616 --> 00:24:35,848
<font color="#696969">~ What was that? Blaise?
~ Don't know.</font>

238
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:39,080
<font color="#696969">Relax, boys. It's probably just a first-year messing around.</font>

239
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:42,625
<font color="#696969">Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.</font>

240
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:56,075
<font color="#696969">Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.</font>

241
00:24:56,284 --> 00:24:58,265
<font color="#696969">I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower....</font>

242
00:24:58,473 --> 00:25:00,559
<font color="#696969">....if I had to continue
for another two years.</font>

243
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,123
<font color="#696969">What's that supposed to mean?</font>

244
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:07,231
<font color="#696969">Let's just say you won't see me wasting my time in Charms class next year.</font>

245
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:10,776
<font color="#696969">Amused, Blaise?</font>

246
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:14,634
<font color="#696969">We'll see just who's laughing in the end.</font>

247
00:25:36,842 --> 00:25:40,596
<font color="#696969">You two go on.
I wanna check something.</font>

248
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:44,036
<font color="#696969">Where's Harry?</font>

249
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:47,164
<font color="#696969">He's probably already on the platform. Come on.</font>

250
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:06,349
<font color="#696969">Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?</font>

251
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:08,121
<font color="#696969">Petrificus Totalus.</font>

252
00:26:19,382 --> 00:26:20,842
<font color="#696969">Oh, yeah....</font>

253
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:24,491
<font color="#696969">....she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.</font>

254
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:33,145
<font color="#696969">That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.</font>

255
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,812
<font color="#696969">Finite.</font>

256
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:26,215
<font color="#696969">~ Hello, Harry.
~ Luna!</font>

257
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:31,324
<font color="#696969">~ How'd you know where I was?
~ Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.</font>

258
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:40,708
<font color="#696969">Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.</font>

259
00:27:40,812 --> 00:27:44,044
<font color="#696969">That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.</font>

260
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:46,233
<font color="#696969">Oh, I am your friend, Luna.</font>

261
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:48,423
<font color="#696969">That's nice.</font>

262
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:51,759
<font color="#696969">About time. I've been looking all over for you two.</font>

263
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:54,783
<font color="#696969">Right. Names?</font>

264
00:27:55,096 --> 00:27:57,390
<font color="#696969">Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.</font>

265
00:27:57,598 --> 00:27:59,683
<font color="#696969">No exceptions, Potter.</font>

266
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:01,977
<font color="#696969">Who are those people?</font>

267
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:04,480
<font color="#696969">Aurors. For security.</font>

268
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:06,148
<font color="#696969">What's this cane here, then?</font>

269
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:08,650
<font color="#696969">It's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick.</font>

270
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:12,821
<font color="#696969">And what exactly would you
be wanting with a....?</font>

271
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:17,096
<font color="#696969">Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.</font>

272
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,517
<font color="#696969">It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.</font>

273
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,797
<font color="#696969">Nice face, Potter.</font>

274
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:40,763
<font color="#696969">Would you like me to fix it for you?</font>

275
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:44,621
<font color="#696969">Personally, I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way....</font>

276
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,394
<font color="#696969">....but it's up to you.</font>

277
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:49,104
<font color="#696969">Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?</font>

278
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:52,962
<font color="#696969">No, but I've done several toes, and how different are they, really?</font>

279
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:57,967
<font color="#696969">Um....Okay, yeah. Give it a go.</font>

280
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,450
<font color="#696969">~ Episkey.
~ Ah!</font>

281
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:11,730
<font color="#696969">~ How do I look?
~ Exceptionally ordinary.</font>

282
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,232
<font color="#696969">Brilliant.</font>

283
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,616
<font color="#696969">Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.</font>

284
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:30,184
<font color="#696969">Will you stop eating?</font>

285
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,687
<font color="#696969">Your best friend is missing!</font>

286
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:36,023
<font color="#696969">Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.</font>

287
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:40,402
<font color="#696969">He's covered in blood again.</font>

288
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:44,781
<font color="#696969">~ Why is it he's always covered in blood?
~ Looks like it's his own this time.</font>

289
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:47,075
<font color="#696969">Where have you been?</font>

290
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:49,786
<font color="#696969">~ What happened to your face?
~ Later.</font>

291
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,558
<font color="#696969">What've I missed?</font>

292
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,833
<font color="#696969">Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times.</font>

293
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:59,587
<font color="#696969">Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?</font>

294
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,179
<font color="#696969">Very best of evenings to you all.</font>

295
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:10,326
<font color="#696969">Thanks.</font>

296
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:17,207
<font color="#696969">First off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff....</font>

<font color="#696969">Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say....</font>

299
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:29,823
<font color="#696969">....has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.</font>

300
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:32,951
<font color="#696969">Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts....</font>

301
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,932
<font color="#696969">....will be taken by Professor Snape.</font>

302
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:36,809
<font color="#696969">Snape?</font>

303
00:30:42,856 --> 00:30:44,420
<font color="#696969">Now, as you know....</font>

304
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:48,278
<font color="#696969">....each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival here tonight.</font>

305
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:50,467
<font color="#696969">And you have the right to know why.</font>

306
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:54,846
<font color="#696969">Once there was a young man, who, like you....</font>

307
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:57,453
<font color="#696969">....sat in this very hall....</font>

308
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,458
<font color="#696969">....walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roof.</font>

309
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:07,462
<font color="#696969">He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.</font>

310
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:09,131
<font color="#696969">His name?</font>

311
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,946
<font color="#696969">Tom Riddle.</font>

312
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,827
<font color="#696969">Today, of course....</font>

313
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:22,685
<font color="#696969">....he's known all over the world by another name.</font>

314
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:29,045
<font color="#696969">Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight....</font>

315
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:31,547
<font color="#696969">....I'm reminded of a sobering fact.</font>

316
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:35,926
<font color="#696969">Every day, every hour....</font>

317
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:38,012
<font color="#696969">....this very minute, perhaps....</font>

318
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,495
<font color="#696969">....dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls.</font>

319
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:49,689
<font color="#696969">But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.</font>

320
00:31:52,713 --> 00:31:54,902
<font color="#696969">Just something to think about.</font>

321
00:31:56,153 --> 00:31:57,717
<font color="#696969">Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.</font>

322
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:01,158
<font color="#696969">That was cheerful.</font>

323
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:11,167
<font color="#696969">History of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down.</font>

324
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:17,006
<font color="#696969">Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.</font>

325
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:21,177
<font color="#696969">Potter.</font>

326
00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:24,513
<font color="#696969">Oh, this can't be good.</font>

327
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,205
<font color="#696969">Enjoying ourselves, are we?</font>

328
00:32:30,143 --> 00:32:33,271
<font color="#696969">~ I had a free period this morning.
~ So I noticed.</font>

329
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:36,191
<font color="#696969">I would think you would want to fill it with Potions.</font>

330
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,110
<font color="#696969">Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?</font>

331
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,489
<font color="#696969">It was, but I was told I had to get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.</font>

332
00:32:43,698 --> 00:32:46,513
<font color="#696969">So you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions.</font>

333
00:32:46,721 --> 00:32:51,309
<font color="#696969">However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. s students....</font>

334
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:53,290
<font color="#696969">....with "Exceeds Expectations."</font>

335
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:55,375
<font color="#696969">Brilliant. Um....</font>

336
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:58,086
<font color="#696969">~ Well, I'll head there straightaway.
~ Oh, good, good.</font>

337
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:03,091
<font color="#696969">Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.</font>

338
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,219
<font color="#696969">I don't wanna take Potions.</font>

339
00:33:06,427 --> 00:33:09,138
<font color="#696969">This is Quidditch trials coming up. I need to practice.</font>

340
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:12,266
<font color="#696969">Attention to detail
in the preparation....</font>

341
00:33:12,474 --> 00:33:14,768
<font color="#696969">....is the prerequisite of all planning.</font>

342
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,688
<font color="#696969">Ah.</font>

343
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:21,754
<font color="#696969">Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry. We've brought someone with us, I see.</font>

344
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,526
<font color="#696969">Ron Weasley, sir.</font>

345
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:26,550
<font color="#696969">But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace, actually.</font>

346
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,844
<font color="#696969">~ I'm gonna....
~ Nonsense, we'll sort you out.</font>

347
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:32,076
<font color="#696969">Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out.</font>

348
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:34,787
<font color="#696969">I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.</font>

349
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:36,664
<font color="#696969">Get what you want from the cupboard.</font>

350
00:33:36,872 --> 00:33:40,209
<font color="#696969">Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.</font>

351
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:44,275
<font color="#696969">Any ideas what these might be?</font>

352
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,341
<font color="#696969">~ Yes, Miss....?
~ Granger, sir.</font>

353
00:33:51,678 --> 00:33:56,057
<font color="#696969">That one there is Veritaserum. It's a truth-telling serum.</font>

354
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:58,976
<font color="#696969">And that would be Polyjuice Potion.</font>

355
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,293
<font color="#696969">It's terribly tricky to make.</font>

356
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:06,483
<font color="#696969">And this is Amortentia....</font>

357
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:09,090
<font color="#696969">....the most powerful
love potion in the world.</font>

358
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:13,781
<font color="#696969">It's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them.</font>

359
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,118
<font color="#696969">For example, I smell....</font>

360
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:21,914
<font color="#696969">....freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and....</font>

361
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:25,459
<font color="#696969">....spearmint toothpaste.</font>

362
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,255
<font color="#696969">Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.</font>

363
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:35,468
<font color="#696969">But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.</font>

364
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:42,350
<font color="#696969">And for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.</font>

365
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:50,691
<font color="#696969">Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.</font>

366
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:52,776
<font color="#696969">Oh, yes.</font>

367
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,487
<font color="#696969">What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen....</font>

368
00:34:55,695 --> 00:35:01,117
<font color="#696969">....is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis.</font>

369
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,724
<font color="#696969">But it is more commonly referred to as....</font>

370
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:09,250
<font color="#696969">~ Liquid luck.
~ Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.</font>

371
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:12,690
<font color="#696969">Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong.</font>

372
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:18,529
<font color="#696969">One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.</font>

373
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,013
<font color="#696969">At least until the effects wear off.</font>

374
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:27,704
<font color="#696969">So this is what I offer each of you today.</font>

375
00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:32,709
<font color="#696969">One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who, in the hour that remains....</font>

376
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:37,505
<font color="#696969">....manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death....</font>

377
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:40,946
<font color="#696969">....the recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books.</font>

378
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,699
<font color="#696969">I should point out, however, only once did a student manage to 
brew a potion....</font>

379
00:35:44,908 --> 00:35:48,244
<font color="#696969">....of sufficient quality to claim this prize.</font>

380
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,059
<font color="#696969">Nevertheless, good luck to you all.</font>

381
00:35:51,998 --> 00:35:53,770
<font color="#696969">Let the brewing commence.</font>

382
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:31,409
<font color="#696969">How did you do that?</font>

383
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:34,120
<font color="#696969">You crush it. Don't cut it.</font>

384
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:36,727
<font color="#696969">No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.</font>

385
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:38,812
<font color="#696969">No, really.</font>

386
00:37:16,243 --> 00:37:19,475
<font color="#696969">Merlin's beard! It is perfect.</font>

387
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:24,167
<font color="#696969">So perfect I dare say
one drop would kill us all.</font>

388
00:37:27,503 --> 00:37:29,380
<font color="#696969">So here we are, then, as promised.</font>

389
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:32,821
<font color="#696969">One vial of Felix Felicis.</font>

390
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:35,010
<font color="#696969">Congratulations.</font>

391
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:38,242
<font color="#696969">Use it well.</font>

392
00:38:05,872 --> 00:38:08,583
<font color="#696969">Harry, you got my message. Come in.</font>

393
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:11,607
<font color="#696969">How are you?</font>

394
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:13,275
<font color="#696969">I'm fine, sir.</font>

395
00:38:13,484 --> 00:38:14,735
<font color="#696969">Enjoying your classes?</font>

396
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:19,010
<font color="#696969">I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.</font>

397
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:22,033
<font color="#696969">I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.</font>

398
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:23,806
<font color="#696969">Do you?</font>

399
00:38:24,431 --> 00:38:25,682
<font color="#696969">Definitely.</font>

400
00:38:27,663 --> 00:38:30,479
<font color="#696969">What about your activities
outside the classroom?</font>

401
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,711
<font color="#696969">~ Sir?
~ Well, I notice you spend....</font>

402
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:36,526
<font color="#696969">....a great deal of time with Miss Granger.</font>

403
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,881
<font color="#696969">I can't help wondering....</font>

404
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:43,094
<font color="#696969">Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant, and we're friends, but, no.</font>

405
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,222
<font color="#696969">Forgive me. I was merely being curious.</font>

406
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:49,246
<font color="#696969">But enough chitchat.</font>

407
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:53,000
<font color="#696969">You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.</font>

408
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,440
<font color="#696969">The answer lies here.</font>

409
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,568
<font color="#696969">What you are looking at are memories.</font>

410
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:03,634
<font color="#696969">In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort....</font>

411
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:06,241
<font color="#696969">....or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.</font>

412
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:13,122
<font color="#696969">This vial contains
the most particular memory....</font>

413
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:15,520
<font color="#696969">....of the day I first met him.</font>

414
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,587
<font color="#696969">I'd like you to see it, if you would.</font>

415
00:39:57,226 --> 00:40:01,501
<font color="#696969">I admit some confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.</font>

416
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:05,254
<font color="#696969">In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor.</font>

417
00:40:05,463 --> 00:40:09,216
<font color="#696969">There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.</font>

418
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:13,804
<font color="#696969">Tom, you have a visitor.</font>

419
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:15,993
<font color="#696969">How do you do, Tom?</font>

420
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,752
<font color="#696969">Don't.</font>

421
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:35,699
<font color="#696969">~ You're the doctor, aren't you?
~ No.</font>

422
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:37,889
<font color="#696969">I am a professor.</font>

423
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,391
<font color="#696969">I don't believe you.</font>

424
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,581
<font color="#696969">She wants me looked at.</font>

425
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:45,396
<font color="#696969">They think I'm different.</font>

426
00:40:45,604 --> 00:40:47,064
<font color="#696969">Well, perhaps they're right.</font>

427
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:48,732
<font color="#696969">I'm not mad.</font>

428
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:52,173
<font color="#696969">Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.</font>

429
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:54,362
<font color="#696969">Hogwarts is a school.</font>

430
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:56,239
<font color="#696969">A school of magic.</font>

431
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:03,538
<font color="#696969">You can do things, can't you, Tom?</font>

432
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:07,291
<font color="#696969">Things other children can't.</font>

433
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:11,670
<font color="#696969">I can make things move
without touching them.</font>

434
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:16,154
<font color="#696969">I can make animals do what I want without training them.</font>

435
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:20,533
<font color="#696969">I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.</font>

436
00:41:21,158 --> 00:41:23,139
<font color="#696969">I can make them hurt....</font>

437
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:25,224
<font color="#696969">....if I want.</font>

438
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,727
<font color="#696969">Who are you?</font>

439
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:30,021
<font color="#696969">Well, I'm like you, Tom.</font>

440
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:32,731
<font color="#696969">I'm different.</font>

441
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,130
<font color="#696969">Prove it.</font>

442
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:46,599
<font color="#696969">I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom.</font>

443
00:41:56,295 --> 00:42:00,049
<font color="#696969">Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom.</font>

444
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:05,887
<font color="#696969">At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it.</font>

445
00:42:06,096 --> 00:42:07,243
<font color="#696969">You understand me?</font>

446
00:42:11,205 --> 00:42:13,811
<font color="#696969">I can speak to snakes too.</font>

447
00:42:15,062 --> 00:42:16,835
<font color="#696969">They find me.</font>

448
00:42:17,773 --> 00:42:19,754
<font color="#696969">Whisper things.</font>

449
00:42:19,963 --> 00:42:23,091
<font color="#696969">Is that normal for someone like me?</font>

450
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:47,488
<font color="#696969">Did you know, sir? Then?</font>

451
00:42:47,593 --> 00:42:53,223
<font color="#696969">Did I know I'd just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.</font>

452
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:55,934
<font color="#696969">If I had, I....</font>

453
00:42:57,602 --> 00:43:00,104
<font color="#696969">Over time, while here at Hogwarts....</font>

454
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:03,545
<font color="#696969">....Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.</font>

455
00:43:03,754 --> 00:43:05,526
<font color="#696969">Can you guess
who that teacher might be?</font>

456
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:11,990
<font color="#696969">You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you?</font>

457
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:14,180
<font color="#696969">No, I did not.</font>

458
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:18,142
<font color="#696969">You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly.</font>

459
00:43:19,185 --> 00:43:21,061
<font color="#696969">And he will not give it up easily.</font>

460
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:24,398
<font color="#696969">You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.</font>

461
00:43:24,606 --> 00:43:25,857
<font color="#696969">I did.</font>

462
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:28,568
<font color="#696969">Do you want me to let him?</font>

463
00:43:29,924 --> 00:43:31,279
<font color="#696969">Yes.</font>

464
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,192
<font color="#696969">All right. Um....</font>

465
00:44:57,297 --> 00:45:00,425
<font color="#696969">This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills....</font>

466
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:02,718
<font color="#696969">....just to assess your strengths.</font>

467
00:45:03,448 --> 00:45:05,429
<font color="#696969">Quiet! Please!</font>

468
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:06,785
<font color="#696969">Shut it!</font>

469
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:13,353
<font color="#696969">Thanks. All right. Um....</font>

470
00:45:13,562 --> 00:45:15,647
<font color="#696969">Just because you
made the team last year....</font>

471
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:18,775
<font color="#696969">....does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear?</font>

472
00:45:21,277 --> 00:45:22,529
<font color="#696969">Good.</font>

473
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:33,476
<font color="#696969">No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?</font>

474
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:35,249
<font color="#696969">Hard feelings?</font>

475
00:45:35,457 --> 00:45:39,002
<font color="#696969">Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well. It's nothing personal.</font>

476
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:41,817
<font color="#696969">Really? Strapping guy like you?</font>

477
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:44,528
<font color="#696969">You've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think?</font>

478
00:45:44,737 --> 00:45:47,135
<font color="#696969">Keepers need to be quick, agile.</font>

479
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,263
<font color="#696969">Oh, I like my chances.</font>

480
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:54,225
<font color="#696969">Say, think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?</font>

481
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:58,604
<font color="#696969">Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?</font>

482
00:46:10,907 --> 00:46:12,575
<font color="#696969">Come on, Weasley!</font>

483
00:46:12,784 --> 00:46:14,452
<font color="#696969">~ Come on, Ron!
~ Go on, Weasley!</font>

484
00:46:16,016 --> 00:46:18,935
<font color="#696969">~ Go on, Weasley!
~ Yeah, Ron!</font>

485
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,291
<font color="#696969">Go on, Cormac!</font>

486
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:38,954
<font color="#696969">Come on, Ron!</font>

487
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:48,859
<font color="#696969">Come on, Ron.</font>

488
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:51,465
<font color="#696969">Come on, Ron.</font>

489
00:47:09,399 --> 00:47:10,546
<font color="#696969">Confundus.</font>

490
00:47:26,602 --> 00:47:29,000
<font color="#696969">Isn't he brilliant?</font>

491
00:47:31,711 --> 00:47:35,256
<font color="#696969">I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.</font>

492
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:38,384
<font color="#696969">I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.</font>

493
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:41,825
<font color="#696969">He's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac.</font>

494
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:44,953
<font color="#696969">He's vile.</font>

495
00:47:49,853 --> 00:47:52,147
<font color="#696969">Have you ever heard of this spell? Sectumsempra?</font>

496
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:54,336
<font color="#696969">No, I haven't.</font>

497
00:47:54,545 --> 00:47:57,673
<font color="#696969">And if you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in.</font>

498
00:47:57,881 --> 00:48:00,279
<font color="#696969">Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.</font>

499
00:48:00,488 --> 00:48:04,658
<font color="#696969">He's even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he's a genius.</font>

500
00:48:05,805 --> 00:48:07,057
<font color="#696969">What?</font>

501
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:10,602
<font color="#696969">I'd like to know whose that book was. Let's have a look.</font>

502
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,270
<font color="#696969">No.</font>

503
00:48:13,729 --> 00:48:15,085
<font color="#696969">Why not?</font>

504
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:17,274
<font color="#696969">The binding is fragile.</font>

505
00:48:17,379 --> 00:48:19,985
<font color="#696969">~ The binding is fragile?
~ Yeah.</font>

506
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,824
<font color="#696969">~ Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
~ Who?</font>

507
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:29,786
<font color="#696969">That's what it says right here: "This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince."</font>

508
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:50,430
<font color="#696969">For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it....</font>

509
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,933
<font color="#696969">....yet you have no desire to find out who he is?</font>

510
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:56,478
<font color="#696969">I didn't say I wasn't curious, and I don't sleep with it.</font>

511
00:48:56,686 --> 00:48:57,729
<font color="#696969">Well, it's true.</font>

512
00:48:57,937 --> 00:49:01,691
<font color="#696969">I like a nice chat before I go to bed. Now all you do is read that bloody book.</font>

513
00:49:01,795 --> 00:49:03,776
<font color="#696969">It's just like being with Hermione.</font>

514
00:49:05,131 --> 00:49:07,634
<font color="#696969">Well, I was curious, so I went to....</font>

515
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:10,345
<font color="#696969">~ The library.
~ The library. And?</font>

516
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,847
<font color="#696969">And nothing.</font>

517
00:49:13,055 --> 00:49:16,079
<font color="#696969">I couldn't find a reference anywhere to a Half-Blood Prince.</font>

518
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:18,373
<font color="#696969">~ There we go. That settles it, then.
~ Filius!</font>

519
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:20,875
<font color="#696969">I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!</font>

520
00:49:20,979 --> 00:49:25,671
<font color="#696969">No, emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace.</font>

521
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,614
<font color="#696969">Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?</font>

522
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,221
<font color="#696969">A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.</font>

523
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:37,974
<font color="#696969">We had a very long, homemade, Norwegian-style sledge....</font>

524
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,581
<font color="#696969">No, not there. Over here.</font>

525
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:42,771
<font color="#696969">No, sit beside me.</font>

526
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:45,794
<font color="#696969">Okay.</font>

527
00:49:47,254 --> 00:49:48,609
<font color="#696969">Something to drink?</font>

528
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:51,320
<font color="#696969">Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.</font>

529
00:50:03,102 --> 00:50:05,083
<font color="#696969">Oh, bloody hell.</font>

530
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:09,879
<font color="#696969">Slick git.</font>

531
00:50:10,192 --> 00:50:12,903
<font color="#696969">Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.</font>

532
00:50:15,718 --> 00:50:16,969
<font color="#696969">And snogging.</font>

533
00:50:17,595 --> 00:50:20,618
<font color="#696969">~ I'd like to leave.
~ What?</font>

534
00:50:20,723 --> 00:50:22,391
<font color="#696969">You can't be serious.</font>

535
00:50:22,495 --> 00:50:24,893
<font color="#696969">~ That happens to be my sister.
~ So?</font>

536
00:50:25,102 --> 00:50:28,959
<font color="#696969">What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? You expect her 
to leave?</font>

537
00:50:30,315 --> 00:50:32,713
<font color="#696969">~ Hey, my boy!
~ Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.</font>

538
00:50:32,921 --> 00:50:34,902
<font color="#696969">And you, and you.</font>

539
00:50:35,111 --> 00:50:36,883
<font color="#696969">So, what brings you here?</font>

540
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:41,784
<font color="#696969">The Three Broomsticks and I go way back, further than I care to admit.</font>

541
00:50:41,888 --> 00:50:45,329
<font color="#696969">I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.</font>

542
00:50:45,537 --> 00:50:48,874
<font color="#696969">All hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my boy, in the old days....</font>

543
00:50:49,082 --> 00:50:52,419
<font color="#696969">....I used to throw together the occasional supper party....</font>

544
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:54,817
<font color="#696969">....for the select student or two.</font>

545
00:50:55,025 --> 00:50:58,883
<font color="#696969">~ Would you be game?
~ I'd consider it an honor, sir.</font>

546
00:51:00,343 --> 00:51:02,532
<font color="#696969">You would be welcome too, Granger.</font>

547
00:51:03,262 --> 00:51:08,058
<font color="#696969">~ I'd be delighted, sir.
~ Splendid. Look for my owl.</font>

548
00:51:08,892 --> 00:51:10,873
<font color="#696969">Good to see you, Wallenby.</font>

549
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:17,546
<font color="#696969">What are you playing at?</font>

550
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,613
<font color="#696969">Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.</font>

551
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:23,802
<font color="#696969">~ Get to know him?
~ I don't know.</font>

552
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:27,660
<font color="#696969">It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.</font>

553
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,375
<font color="#696969">Got a little bit....</font>

554
00:51:46,323 --> 00:51:48,200
<font color="#696969">Katie, you don't know what it could be.</font>

555
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:49,764
<font color="#696969">~ Harry.
~ What?</font>

556
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:53,517
<font color="#696969">Did you hear what she said back at the pub about me and her snogging?</font>

557
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:56,020
<font color="#696969">As if.</font>

558
00:52:02,484 --> 00:52:05,820
<font color="#696969">I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.</font>

559
00:52:27,299 --> 00:52:30,009
<font color="#696969">Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.</font>

560
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:47,317
<font color="#696969">Do not touch that, except by the wrappings. Do you understand?</font>

561
00:53:00,872 --> 00:53:03,374
<font color="#696969">You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession....</font>

562
00:53:03,582 --> 00:53:06,085
<font color="#696969">....when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?</font>

563
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:08,274
<font color="#696969">It's like I said.</font>

564
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:13,383
<font color="#696969">She left to go to the loo, and when she came back she had the package.</font>

565
00:53:14,634 --> 00:53:17,345
<font color="#696969">She said it was important
that she deliver it.</font>

566
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:21,724
<font color="#696969">~ Did she say to whom?
~ To Professor Dumbledore.</font>

567
00:53:22,037 --> 00:53:24,644
<font color="#696969">Very well. Thank you, Leanne. You may go.</font>

568
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,861
<font color="#696969">Why is it when something happens it is always you three?</font>

569
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:40,387
<font color="#696969">Believe me, professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.</font>

570
00:53:40,909 --> 00:53:42,577
<font color="#696969">Oh, Severus.</font>

571
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:50,084
<font color="#696969">What do you think?</font>

572
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:56,861
<font color="#696969">I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.</font>

573
00:53:56,965 --> 00:53:59,259
<font color="#696969">She was cursed, wasn't she?</font>

574
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:02,074
<font color="#696969">I know Katie. Off the pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly.</font>

575
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:06,141
<font color="#696969">If she was delivering that to Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly.</font>

576
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:08,226
<font color="#696969">Yes, she was cursed.</font>

577
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,728
<font color="#696969">It was Malfoy.</font>

578
00:54:12,605 --> 00:54:16,463
<font color="#696969">That is a very serious accusation, Potter.</font>

579
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:18,131
<font color="#696969">Indeed.</font>

580
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:22,406
<font color="#696969">~ Your evidence?
~ I just know.</font>

581
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:25,117
<font color="#696969">You just....</font>

582
00:54:26,368 --> 00:54:27,723
<font color="#696969">....know.</font>

583
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:32,728
<font color="#696969">You astonish with your gifts, Potter.</font>

584
00:54:32,832 --> 00:54:36,794
<font color="#696969">Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.</font>

585
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:43,154
<font color="#696969">How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.</font>

586
00:54:47,846 --> 00:54:51,287
<font color="#696969">I suggest you go back to your dormitories. All of you.</font>

587
00:55:01,817 --> 00:55:04,737
<font color="#696969">What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?</font>

588
00:55:06,405 --> 00:55:08,490
<font color="#696969">Well, what does she see in him?</font>

589
00:55:08,594 --> 00:55:10,784
<font color="#696969">Dean? He's brilliant.</font>

590
00:55:10,993 --> 00:55:13,808
<font color="#696969">You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.</font>

591
00:55:14,016 --> 00:55:17,770
<font color="#696969">Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?</font>

592
00:55:17,978 --> 00:55:22,462
<font color="#696969">Something snaps, and you've gotta hate him, you know? On principle.</font>

593
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:24,651
<font color="#696969">I suppose.</font>

594
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:29,134
<font color="#696969">~ So, what is it he sees in her?
~ I don't know.</font>

595
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:32,262
<font color="#696969">She's smart, funny.</font>

596
00:55:32,992 --> 00:55:35,286
<font color="#696969">~ Attractive.
~ Attractive?</font>

597
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:40,395
<font color="#696969">~ You know, she's got nice skin.
~ Skin?</font>

598
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:43,001
<font color="#696969">Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?</font>

599
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:47,693
<font color="#696969">Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.</font>

600
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,802
<font color="#696969">Hermione's got nice skin.</font>

601
00:55:53,532 --> 00:55:56,243
<font color="#696969">Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.</font>

602
00:55:57,286 --> 00:55:59,371
<font color="#696969">I've never really thought about it.</font>

603
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:02,603
<font color="#696969">But, I suppose, yeah.</font>

604
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,793
<font color="#696969">Very nice.</font>

605
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:12,612
<font color="#696969">~ I think I'll be going to sleep now.
~ Right. Yeah.</font>

606
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:26,375
<font color="#696969">So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your Uncle Tiberius these days?</font>

607
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:29,086
<font color="#696969">Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him....</font>

608
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,484
<font color="#696969">....and the Minister for Magic over the holidays.</font>

609
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,612
<font color="#696969">Well, be sure to give them both my best.</font>

610
00:56:34,716 --> 00:56:36,697
<font color="#696969">What about your uncle, Belby?</font>

611
00:56:36,906 --> 00:56:40,347
<font color="#696969">For those who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.</font>

612
00:56:40,555 --> 00:56:43,370
<font color="#696969">~ Is he working on anything new?
~ Don't know.</font>

613
00:56:43,474 --> 00:56:47,541
<font color="#696969">Him and Dad don't get on. Probably because me dad says potions are rubbish.</font>

614
00:56:47,749 --> 00:56:51,086
<font color="#696969">Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day.</font>

615
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:56,299
<font color="#696969">What about you, Miss Granger? What does your family do in the 
Muggle world?</font>

616
00:56:57,133 --> 00:56:58,905
<font color="#696969">My parents are dentists.</font>

617
00:57:03,493 --> 00:57:04,744
<font color="#696969">They tend to people's teeth.</font>

618
00:57:04,953 --> 00:57:09,645
<font color="#696969">Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?</font>

619
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:11,104
<font color="#696969">No.</font>

620
00:57:13,085 --> 00:57:17,569
<font color="#696969">Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick, did bite my father once.</font>

621
00:57:17,777 --> 00:57:19,028
<font color="#696969">He needed 10 stitches.</font>

622
00:57:25,284 --> 00:57:28,933
<font color="#696969">Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.</font>

623
00:57:31,644 --> 00:57:36,023
<font color="#696969">Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.</font>

624
00:57:36,232 --> 00:57:38,943
<font color="#696969">Sorry. I'm not usually late.</font>

625
00:57:42,696 --> 00:57:47,180
<font color="#696969">No matter. You're just in time for dessert, that is, if Belby's left you any.</font>

626
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,146
<font color="#696969">What?</font>

627
00:57:56,355 --> 00:57:57,919
<font color="#696969">Nothing.</font>

628
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:07,928
<font color="#696969">Goodbye. Bye-bye.</font>

629
00:58:12,828 --> 00:58:14,497
<font color="#696969">~ Potter.
~ I'm sorry, sir.</font>

630
00:58:14,705 --> 00:58:17,312
<font color="#696969">I was just admiring your hourglass.</font>

631
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:20,127
<font color="#696969">Oh, yes.</font>

632
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:22,733
<font color="#696969">A most intriguing object.</font>

633
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,634
<font color="#696969">The sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation.</font>

634
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:31,179
<font color="#696969">If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.</font>

635
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,577
<font color="#696969">~ If it is not....
~ I think I'll be going.</font>

636
00:58:33,785 --> 00:58:37,122
<font color="#696969">Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.</font>

637
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:39,520
<font color="#696969">As to some of your classmates....</font>

638
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:43,065
<font color="#696969">....well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.</font>

639
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:44,733
<font color="#696969">The shelf, sir?</font>

640
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,008
<font color="#696969">Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.</font>

641
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:52,970
<font color="#696969">But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?</font>

642
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:56,515
<font color="#696969">Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?</font>

643
00:58:58,704 --> 00:59:02,666
<font color="#696969">You knew him, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.</font>

644
00:59:03,709 --> 00:59:07,254
<font color="#696969">Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst here at Hogwarts.</font>

645
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:08,922
<font color="#696969">What was he like?</font>

646
00:59:12,676 --> 00:59:15,074
<font color="#696969">I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.</font>

647
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:17,576
<font color="#696969">He killed my parents.</font>

648
00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:21,538
<font color="#696969">Of course.</font>

649
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:24,979
<font color="#696969">It's only natural
you should want to know more.</font>

650
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,879
<font color="#696969">But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.</font>

651
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:33,111
<font color="#696969">When I first met Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet....</font>

652
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:37,490
<font color="#696969">....albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.</font>

653
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,367
<font color="#696969">Not unlike others I've known.</font>

654
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,078
<font color="#696969">Not unlike yourself, in fact.</font>

655
00:59:43,433 --> 00:59:45,519
<font color="#696969">If the monster existed....</font>

656
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,334
<font color="#696969">....it was buried deep within.</font>

657
01:00:05,642 --> 01:00:07,101
<font color="#696969">Good luck, eh, Ron.</font>

658
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:10,959
<font color="#696969">~ Nice hat!
~ Ron, you're a loser.</font>

659
01:00:11,168 --> 01:00:14,191
<font color="#696969">I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?</font>

660
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,694
<font color="#696969">~ Looking good, Ron.
~ Loser!</font>

661
01:00:18,987 --> 01:00:20,447
<font color="#696969">What's he wearing?</font>

662
01:00:29,101 --> 01:00:30,873
<font color="#696969">So how was it, then?</font>

663
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:34,418
<font color="#696969">~ How was what?
~ Your dinner party?</font>

664
01:00:34,627 --> 01:00:36,295
<font color="#696969">Pretty boring, actually.</font>

665
01:00:37,025 --> 01:00:39,423
<font color="#696969">Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.</font>

666
01:00:42,759 --> 01:00:45,575
<font color="#696969">Slughorn's having a Christmas do, you know.</font>

667
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:47,243
<font color="#696969">And we're meant to bring someone.</font>

668
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:51,101
<font color="#696969">I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. He's in the Slug Club, 
isn't he?</font>

669
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:54,124
<font color="#696969">~ Actually, I was going to ask you.
~ Really?</font>

670
01:00:56,939 --> 01:00:59,025
<font color="#696969">Good luck today, Ron.</font>

671
01:00:59,859 --> 01:01:02,153
<font color="#696969">I know you'll be brilliant.</font>

672
01:01:05,176 --> 01:01:08,930
<font color="#696969">I'm resigning. After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot.</font>

673
01:01:09,138 --> 01:01:10,598
<font color="#696969">Have it your way.</font>

674
01:01:10,806 --> 01:01:13,309
<font color="#696969">~ Juice?
~ Sure.</font>

675
01:01:13,413 --> 01:01:15,185
<font color="#696969">Hello, everyone.</font>

676
01:01:16,437 --> 01:01:18,522
<font color="#696969">You look dreadful, Ron.</font>

677
01:01:18,626 --> 01:01:21,024
<font color="#696969">Is that why you put something in his cup?</font>

678
01:01:23,214 --> 01:01:24,882
<font color="#696969">Is it a tonic?</font>

679
01:01:28,323 --> 01:01:29,991
<font color="#696969">Liquid luck.</font>

680
01:01:31,346 --> 01:01:33,015
<font color="#696969">Don't drink it, Ron.</font>

681
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:43,962
<font color="#696969">~ You could be expelled for that.
~ I don't know what you're talking about.</font>

682
01:01:46,152 --> 01:01:48,863
<font color="#696969">Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.</font>

683
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:14,512
<font color="#696969">Yes!</font>

684
01:02:14,929 --> 01:02:17,848
<font color="#696969">Go on, Ron! Do it!</font>

685
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:54,027
<font color="#696969">Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</font>

686
01:02:54,549 --> 01:02:55,904
<font color="#696969">Yes!</font>

687
01:02:56,008 --> 01:02:59,553
<font color="#696969">Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</font>

688
01:03:03,307 --> 01:03:04,871
<font color="#696969">Whoo!</font>

689
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:08,312
<font color="#696969">Yes. Whoo!</font>

690
01:03:09,771 --> 01:03:14,880
<font color="#696969">Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</font>

691
01:03:19,155 --> 01:03:20,823
<font color="#696969">You really shouldn't have done it.</font>

692
01:03:21,032 --> 01:03:26,036
<font color="#696969">I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm.</font>

693
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:31,667
<font color="#696969">That was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game.</font>

694
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,150
<font color="#696969">You didn't put it in.</font>

695
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:39,695
<font color="#696969">Ron only thought you did.</font>

696
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:30,784
<font color="#696969">Charms spell. I'm just practicing.</font>

697
01:04:34,642 --> 01:04:36,519
<font color="#696969">Well, they're really good.</font>

698
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,026
<font color="#696969">How does it feel, Harry?</font>

699
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,073
<font color="#696969">When you see Dean with Ginny?</font>

700
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,641
<font color="#696969">I know.</font>

701
01:04:57,684 --> 01:04:59,874
<font color="#696969">I see the way you look at her.</font>

702
01:05:00,603 --> 01:05:02,167
<font color="#696969">You're my best friend.</font>

703
01:05:11,343 --> 01:05:13,115
<font color="#696969">Oops.</font>

704
01:05:14,575 --> 01:05:16,764
<font color="#696969">I think this room's taken.</font>

705
01:05:18,537 --> 01:05:19,997
<font color="#696969">What's with the birds?</font>

706
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:25,105
<font color="#696969">Oppugno.</font>

707
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:54,821
<font color="#696969">It feels like this.</font>

708
01:06:34,545 --> 01:06:37,569
<font color="#696969">Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.</font>

709
01:06:37,673 --> 01:06:42,782
<font color="#696969">What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.</font>

710
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,346
<font color="#696969">It's chemical.</font>

711
01:06:44,554 --> 01:06:48,933
<font color="#696969">Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.</font>

712
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:51,853
<font color="#696969">He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.</font>

713
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:54,459
<font color="#696969">I really couldn't care less.</font>

714
01:06:54,668 --> 01:06:58,526
<font color="#696969">Was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?</font>

715
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,194
<font color="#696969">Yes.</font>

716
01:07:00,298 --> 01:07:04,782
<font color="#696969">Now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements.</font>

717
01:07:04,886 --> 01:07:06,137
<font color="#696969">Have you?</font>

718
01:07:06,241 --> 01:07:08,326
<font color="#696969">Yes. Why?</font>

719
01:07:08,431 --> 01:07:12,080
<font color="#696969">I just thought, seeing as neither of us can go with who we'd really like to....</font>

720
01:07:12,288 --> 01:07:14,478
<font color="#696969">....we should go together, as friends.</font>

721
01:07:14,687 --> 01:07:16,251
<font color="#696969">Why didn't I think of that?</font>

722
01:07:16,459 --> 01:07:18,023
<font color="#696969">Who are you going with?</font>

723
01:07:18,127 --> 01:07:20,004
<font color="#696969">Um, it's a surprise.</font>

724
01:07:20,108 --> 01:07:24,383
<font color="#696969">Anyway, it's you we've got to worry about. You can't just take anyone.</font>

725
01:07:25,009 --> 01:07:26,885
<font color="#696969">See that girl over there?</font>

726
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:33,141
<font color="#696969">That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's trying to smuggle you a love potion.</font>

727
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:34,809
<font color="#696969">Really?</font>

728
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:39,293
<font color="#696969">Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.</font>

729
01:07:39,397 --> 01:07:41,170
<font color="#696969">But I am the Chosen One.</font>

730
01:07:41,274 --> 01:07:44,193
<font color="#696969">Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.</font>

731
01:07:46,174 --> 01:07:47,634
<font color="#696969">I'll ask someone I like.</font>

732
01:07:48,468 --> 01:07:50,032
<font color="#696969">Someone cool.</font>

733
01:07:59,728 --> 01:08:02,752
<font color="#696969">I've never been to this part of the castle.</font>

734
01:08:02,961 --> 01:08:06,193
<font color="#696969">At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.</font>

735
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:08,904
<font color="#696969">That's why I wear shoes to bed.</font>

736
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:43,102
<font color="#696969">Harmonia Nectere Passus.</font>

737
01:08:55,614 --> 01:08:58,325
<font color="#696969">Harmonia Nectere Passus.</font>

738
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:02,599
<font color="#696969">Harmonia Nectere Passus.</font>

739
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:18,656
<font color="#696969">Drink?</font>

740
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:20,846
<font color="#696969">Neville.</font>

741
01:09:21,054 --> 01:09:22,514
<font color="#696969">I didn't get into the Slug Club.</font>

742
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:25,746
<font color="#696969">It's okay, though. He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.</font>

743
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:28,770
<font color="#696969">~ Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
~ Okay.</font>

744
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:42,115
<font color="#696969">Hermione. What are you doing? And what happened to you?</font>

745
01:09:42,324 --> 01:09:47,641
<font color="#696969">I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.</font>

746
01:09:47,746 --> 01:09:50,769
<font color="#696969">Cormac? That's who you invited?</font>

747
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,480
<font color="#696969">I thought it would annoy Ron the most.</font>

748
01:09:54,314 --> 01:09:56,295
<font color="#696969">Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.</font>

749
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:59,527
<font color="#696969">He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.</font>

750
01:09:59,632 --> 01:10:01,821
<font color="#696969">~ Dragon tartare?
~ No, I'm fine. Thank you.</font>

751
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,636
<font color="#696969">Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.</font>

752
01:10:04,845 --> 01:10:06,617
<font color="#696969">On second thoughts....</font>

753
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:08,807
<font color="#696969">Might keep Cormac at bay.</font>

754
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,039
<font color="#696969">Oh, God, here he comes.</font>

755
01:10:14,646 --> 01:10:17,461
<font color="#696969">I think she just went to powder her nose.</font>

756
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:19,755
<font color="#696969">Slippery little minx, your friend.</font>

757
01:10:19,963 --> 01:10:22,674
<font color="#696969">Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?</font>

758
01:10:25,698 --> 01:10:27,679
<font color="#696969">What is this I'm eating, by the way?</font>

759
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:30,494
<font color="#696969">Dragon balls.</font>

760
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:44,778
<font color="#696969">You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen.</font>

761
01:10:44,986 --> 01:10:48,844
<font color="#696969">Not so quick, Potter.</font>

762
01:10:50,408 --> 01:10:53,536
<font color="#696969">Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date....</font>

763
01:10:53,744 --> 01:10:57,602
<font color="#696969">Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.</font>

764
01:10:57,811 --> 01:11:00,000
<font color="#696969">Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.</font>

765
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:02,920
<font color="#696969">~ A message?
~ From Professor Dumbledore.</font>

766
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:06,777
<font color="#696969">He asked me to give you his best, and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.</font>

767
01:11:06,882 --> 01:11:08,446
<font color="#696969">You see....</font>

768
01:11:08,654 --> 01:11:14,180
<font color="#696969">....he's traveling, and he won't return until term resumes.</font>

769
01:11:14,389 --> 01:11:15,848
<font color="#696969">Traveling where?</font>

770
01:11:23,981 --> 01:11:25,858
<font color="#696969">Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!</font>

771
01:11:27,005 --> 01:11:28,777
<font color="#696969">Professor Slughorn, sir.</font>

772
01:11:28,881 --> 01:11:33,260
<font color="#696969">I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.</font>

773
01:11:33,365 --> 01:11:35,450
<font color="#696969">He claims to have been
invited to your party.</font>

774
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:38,891
<font color="#696969">Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?</font>

775
01:11:39,516 --> 01:11:43,270
<font color="#696969">I'll escort him out.</font>

776
01:11:46,085 --> 01:11:49,734
<font color="#696969">Certainly, professor.</font>

777
01:11:53,383 --> 01:11:56,615
<font color="#696969">All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.</font>

778
01:11:58,701 --> 01:12:03,601
<font color="#696969">Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?</font>

779
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:05,895
<font color="#696969">I swore to protect you.</font>

780
01:12:06,103 --> 01:12:09,440
<font color="#696969">I made the Unbreakable Vow.</font>

781
01:12:09,544 --> 01:12:11,734
<font color="#696969">I don't need protection.</font>

782
01:12:11,942 --> 01:12:16,113
<font color="#696969">I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.</font>

783
01:12:17,051 --> 01:12:20,492
<font color="#696969">~ And I won't fail him.
~ You're afraid, Draco.</font>

784
01:12:21,117 --> 01:12:25,079
<font color="#696969">You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious. Let me assist you.</font>

785
01:12:25,184 --> 01:12:26,643
<font color="#696969">No!</font>

786
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,397
<font color="#696969">I was chosen. This is my moment.</font>

787
01:12:42,909 --> 01:12:44,472
<font color="#696969">"Unbreakable Vow."</font>

788
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:46,245
<font color="#696969">You're sure that's what Snape said?</font>

789
01:12:46,453 --> 01:12:48,643
<font color="#696969">Positive. Why?</font>

790
01:12:48,852 --> 01:12:52,397
<font color="#696969">Well, it's just you can't break an Unbreakable Vow.</font>

791
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,837
<font color="#696969">I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.</font>

792
01:12:56,359 --> 01:12:58,131
<font color="#696969">You don't understand.</font>

793
01:12:58,757 --> 01:12:59,799
<font color="#696969">Oh, bloody hell.</font>

794
01:13:27,638 --> 01:13:29,514
<font color="#696969">I miss you.</font>

795
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:32,851
<font color="#696969">Lovely.</font>

796
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:36,292
<font color="#696969">All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.</font>

797
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,690
<font color="#696969">I'll take your word for it.</font>

798
01:13:48,803 --> 01:13:53,704
<font color="#696969">So, what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow?</font>

799
01:13:54,225 --> 01:13:55,997
<font color="#696969">You die.</font>

800
01:14:00,585 --> 01:14:02,462
<font color="#696969">Wait, the pudding's still here.</font>

801
01:14:03,713 --> 01:14:07,049
<font color="#696969">Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?</font>

802
01:14:07,154 --> 01:14:08,300
<font color="#696969">I know it sounds mad.</font>

803
01:14:08,405 --> 01:14:11,950
<font color="#696969">Has it occurred to you Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help....</font>

804
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:14,556
<font color="#696969">....so he could find out
what he was up to?</font>

805
01:14:14,765 --> 01:14:17,788
<font color="#696969">~ That's not what it sounded like.
~ Perhaps Harry's right.</font>

806
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:19,978
<font color="#696969">To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's....</font>

807
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:23,627
<font color="#696969">It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgment.</font>

808
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:27,902
<font color="#696969">~ Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
~ Dumbledore can make mistakes.</font>

809
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:29,153
<font color="#696969">You're blinded by hatred.</font>

810
01:14:29,362 --> 01:14:31,447
<font color="#696969">~ I'm not.
~ Yes, you are.</font>

811
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:36,139
<font color="#696969">People are disappearing, Harry, daily.</font>

812
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,328
<font color="#696969">We place our trust
in a handful of people.</font>

813
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:41,456
<font color="#696969">If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed.</font>

814
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,418
<font color="#696969">Open up, you.</font>

815
01:15:09,086 --> 01:15:10,754
<font color="#696969">Don't you trust me?</font>

816
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:18,053
<font color="#696969">It's good.</font>

817
01:15:18,991 --> 01:15:21,806
<font color="#696969">Yeah, I'll just.... Get.... Yeah.</font>

818
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:31,399
<font color="#696969">~ Pie?
~ Not for me, no.</font>

819
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:44,849
<font color="#696969">You'll have to forgive Remus.</font>

820
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:47,976
<font color="#696969">It takes its toll, his condition.</font>

821
01:15:48,915 --> 01:15:50,896
<font color="#696969">Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?</font>

822
01:15:51,104 --> 01:15:53,607
<font color="#696969">We're being followed, all of us.</font>

823
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:56,318
<font color="#696969">Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.</font>

824
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:59,237
<font color="#696969">It's not been easy.</font>

825
01:16:01,218 --> 01:16:02,573
<font color="#696969">Did you get my owl?</font>

826
01:16:02,782 --> 01:16:04,867
<font color="#696969">Yes, I did.</font>

827
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:09,455
<font color="#696969">If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry....</font>

828
01:16:09,559 --> 01:16:12,061
<font color="#696969">....but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.</font>

829
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:15,294
<font color="#696969">As for Draco Malfoy....</font>

830
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:17,066
<font color="#696969">....I know a bit more.</font>

831
01:16:17,692 --> 01:16:20,715
<font color="#696969">~ Go on.
~ I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.</font>

832
01:16:20,924 --> 01:16:23,218
<font color="#696969">I think, from what you described....</font>

833
01:16:23,426 --> 01:16:25,094
<font color="#696969">....what you and Ron saw in summer....</font>

834
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:28,744
<font color="#696969">....the object
that Draco is so interested in....</font>

835
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:30,412
<font color="#696969">....is a vanishing cabinet.</font>

836
01:16:31,246 --> 01:16:32,601
<font color="#696969">A vanishing cabinet?</font>

837
01:16:32,706 --> 01:16:36,772
<font color="#696969">They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.</font>

838
01:16:36,876 --> 01:16:39,900
<font color="#696969">You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking....</font>

839
01:16:40,004 --> 01:16:44,800
<font color="#696969">....one simply had to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.</font>

840
01:16:45,426 --> 01:16:47,198
<font color="#696969">They can transport you anywhere.</font>

841
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:50,743
<font color="#696969">Tricky contraptions though, very temperamental.</font>

842
01:16:50,847 --> 01:16:53,767
<font color="#696969">What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?</font>

843
01:16:53,975 --> 01:16:55,122
<font color="#696969">Nothing.</font>

844
01:16:55,956 --> 01:16:57,625
<font color="#696969">It's still there.</font>

845
01:17:08,781 --> 01:17:10,449
<font color="#696969">It was delicious, Molly, really.</font>

846
01:17:10,658 --> 01:17:11,909
<font color="#696969">Are you sure you won't stay?</font>

847
01:17:12,117 --> 01:17:16,496
<font color="#696969">No, we should go. The first night of the cycle's always the worst.</font>

848
01:17:16,705 --> 01:17:17,643
<font color="#696969">Remus?</font>

849
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,174
<font color="#696969">Sweetheart.</font>

850
01:17:36,515 --> 01:17:38,183
<font color="#696969">Has Ron gone to bed?</font>

851
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:41,207
<font color="#696969">Um.... Not yet. No.</font>

852
01:17:42,979 --> 01:17:44,335
<font color="#696969">Shoelace.</font>

853
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:58,827
<font color="#696969">Merry Christmas, Harry.</font>

854
01:18:00,287 --> 01:18:01,747
<font color="#696969">Merry Christmas.</font>

855
01:18:19,055 --> 01:18:21,348
<font color="#696969">~ Harry, no!
~ Remus!</font>

856
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:32,609
<font color="#696969">Ginny!</font>

857
01:18:35,737 --> 01:18:40,429
<font color="#696969">I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!</font>

858
01:18:40,637 --> 01:18:42,827
<font color="#696969">You coming to get me?</font>

859
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:47,310
<font color="#696969">Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?</font>

860
01:19:17,025 --> 01:19:18,381
<font color="#696969">Harry?</font>

861
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:37,565
<font color="#696969">Stupefy!</font>

862
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:02,171
<font color="#696969">Harry!</font>

863
01:20:15,726 --> 01:20:16,872
<font color="#696969">Ginny!</font>

864
01:20:46,483 --> 01:20:47,943
<font color="#696969">Molly.</font>

865
01:21:10,985 --> 01:21:12,653
<font color="#696969">It's easy for them to get to you.</font>

866
01:21:12,862 --> 01:21:16,928
<font color="#696969">You're bloody lucky you weren't killed. You have to realize who you are, Harry.</font>

867
01:21:17,137 --> 01:21:19,639
<font color="#696969">I know who I am, Hermione, all right?</font>

868
01:21:20,682 --> 01:21:21,829
<font color="#696969">Sorry.</font>

869
01:21:23,497 --> 01:21:26,833
<font color="#696969">Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.</font>

870
01:21:27,042 --> 01:21:29,127
<font color="#696969">That's my Won-Won.</font>

871
01:21:31,212 --> 01:21:33,610
<font color="#696969">Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.</font>

872
01:21:51,231 --> 01:21:53,525
<font color="#696969">I'd like to know
where you get your information.</font>

873
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:56,757
<font color="#696969">More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.</font>

874
01:22:02,387 --> 01:22:03,951
<font color="#696969">Sir....</font>

875
01:22:04,368 --> 01:22:07,183
<font color="#696969">....is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?</font>

876
01:22:07,392 --> 01:22:10,207
<font color="#696969">Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?</font>

877
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:14,586
<font color="#696969">By the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite.</font>

878
01:22:15,212 --> 01:22:17,505
<font color="#696969">But how did you know?</font>

879
01:22:19,278 --> 01:22:20,842
<font color="#696969">Intuition.</font>

880
01:22:25,117 --> 01:22:26,785
<font color="#696969">Gracious. Is it that time already?</font>

881
01:22:26,993 --> 01:22:30,643
<font color="#696969">Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention.</font>

882
01:22:34,709 --> 01:22:38,567
<font color="#696969">Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours.</font>

883
01:22:40,548 --> 01:22:42,529
<font color="#696969">~ Is something on your mind, Tom?
~ Yes, sir.</font>

884
01:22:43,884 --> 01:22:46,699
<font color="#696969">You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.</font>

885
01:22:47,638 --> 01:22:52,642
<font color="#696969">The other professors,
well, they're not like you.</font>

886
01:22:53,059 --> 01:22:56,083
<font color="#696969">They might misunderstand.</font>

887
01:22:56,292 --> 01:22:57,856
<font color="#696969">Go on.</font>

888
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:00,879
<font color="#696969">I was in the library the other night....</font>

889
01:23:01,505 --> 01:23:03,694
<font color="#696969">....in the Restricted Section....</font>

890
01:23:04,424 --> 01:23:07,969
<font color="#696969">....and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.</font>

891
01:23:08,907 --> 01:23:12,348
<font color="#696969">And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.</font>

892
01:23:12,557 --> 01:23:15,372
<font color="#696969">It's called, as I understand it....</font>

893
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:19,438
<font color="#696969">I beg your pardon?</font>

894
01:23:19,647 --> 01:23:23,192
<font color="#696969">I don't know anything about such things, and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!</font>

895
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:28,196
<font color="#696969">Now, get out of here at once, and don't let me ever catch you mentioning it again!</font>

896
01:23:31,116 --> 01:23:32,263
<font color="#696969">Confused?</font>

897
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,452
<font color="#696969">I'd be surprised if you weren't.</font>

898
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:38,101
<font color="#696969">Well, I don't understand.
What happened?</font>

899
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:41,959
<font color="#696969">This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.</font>

900
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:44,044
<font color="#696969">It is also a lie.</font>

901
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:46,755
<font color="#696969">This memory has been tampered with....</font>

902
01:23:46,964 --> 01:23:51,343
<font color="#696969">....by the same person whose memory it is, our old friend, Professor Slughorn.</font>

903
01:23:51,968 --> 01:23:53,949
<font color="#696969">But why would he tamper
with his own memory?</font>

904
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:56,973
<font color="#696969">~ I suspect he's ashamed of it.
~ Why?</font>

905
01:23:57,182 --> 01:23:58,641
<font color="#696969">Why, indeed?</font>

906
01:23:59,475 --> 01:24:02,812
<font color="#696969">I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.</font>

907
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:06,565
<font color="#696969">Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory....</font>

908
01:24:06,774 --> 01:24:08,338
<font color="#696969">....any way you can.</font>

909
01:24:08,546 --> 01:24:10,423
<font color="#696969">I don't know him that well, sir.</font>

910
01:24:14,906 --> 01:24:17,826
<font color="#696969">This memory is everything.</font>

911
01:24:18,347 --> 01:24:20,328
<font color="#696969">Without it, we are blind.</font>

912
01:24:20,849 --> 01:24:24,499
<font color="#696969">Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.</font>

913
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,356
<font color="#696969">You have no choice.</font>

914
01:24:29,608 --> 01:24:31,589
<font color="#696969">You must not fail.</font>

915
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:42,015
<font color="#696969">So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself....</font>

916
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:43,579
<font color="#696969">....with the chapter on antidotes.</font>

917
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:47,541
<font color="#696969">I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. Right, off you go.</font>

918
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:50,147
<font color="#696969">Alys, don't forget your rat tail.</font>

919
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:59,427
<font color="#696969">Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.</font>

920
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:01,512
<font color="#696969">To what do I owe this pleasure?</font>

921
01:25:02,763 --> 01:25:04,744
<font color="#696969">Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.</font>

922
01:25:04,953 --> 01:25:07,247
<font color="#696969">Ask away, dear boy, ask away.</font>

923
01:25:07,351 --> 01:25:10,375
<font color="#696969">The other day I was in the library, in the Restricted Section....</font>

924
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:14,232
<font color="#696969">....and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece 
of magic.</font>

925
01:25:15,588 --> 01:25:18,194
<font color="#696969">Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?</font>

926
01:25:18,403 --> 01:25:21,739
<font color="#696969">Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.</font>

927
01:25:21,948 --> 01:25:26,223
<font color="#696969">It got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us?</font>

928
01:25:28,204 --> 01:25:29,559
<font color="#696969">I'm Potions Master, Harry.</font>

929
01:25:29,768 --> 01:25:32,583
<font color="#696969">I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.</font>

930
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:34,668
<font color="#696969">Yes. Um....</font>

931
01:25:34,877 --> 01:25:37,275
<font color="#696969">He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.</font>

932
01:25:37,483 --> 01:25:39,256
<font color="#696969">What I mean to say is....</font>

933
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:41,862
<font color="#696969">....well, he's not like you.</font>

934
01:25:42,592 --> 01:25:44,365
<font color="#696969">He might misunderstand.</font>

935
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:49,578
<font color="#696969">Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.</font>

936
01:25:49,682 --> 01:25:53,748
<font color="#696969">And so it is with magic. Myself, I always strive to live within the light.</font>

937
01:25:54,374 --> 01:25:56,042
<font color="#696969">I suggest you do the same.</font>

938
01:25:56,459 --> 01:25:59,379
<font color="#696969">Is that what you told Tom Riddle, when he came asking questions?</font>

939
01:26:06,364 --> 01:26:09,388
<font color="#696969">Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he?</font>

940
01:26:11,473 --> 01:26:13,037
<font color="#696969">Didn't he?</font>

941
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,691
<font color="#696969">Yes?</font>

942
01:26:22,108 --> 01:26:24,193
<font color="#696969">Oh, it's you, Potter.</font>

943
01:26:24,402 --> 01:26:26,800
<font color="#696969">I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.</font>

944
01:26:39,624 --> 01:26:43,378
<font color="#696969">It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.</font>

945
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,776
<font color="#696969">Divine.</font>

946
01:26:46,506 --> 01:26:48,800
<font color="#696969">Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?</font>

947
01:26:49,946 --> 01:26:53,491
<font color="#696969">It was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one.</font>

948
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:57,141
<font color="#696969">~ Or 20.
~ I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.</font>

949
01:26:57,349 --> 01:26:59,330
<font color="#696969">Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.</font>

950
01:26:59,539 --> 01:27:01,832
<font color="#696969">She could never annoy me.</font>

951
01:27:03,605 --> 01:27:05,169
<font color="#696969">I think I love her.</font>

952
01:27:08,714 --> 01:27:11,008
<font color="#696969">Well, brilliant.</font>

953
01:27:14,865 --> 01:27:16,534
<font color="#696969">Do you think she knows I exist?</font>

954
01:27:16,638 --> 01:27:19,140
<font color="#696969">I hope so. She's been snogging you for three months.</font>

955
01:27:19,349 --> 01:27:22,268
<font color="#696969">Snogging? Who are you talking about?</font>

956
01:27:23,207 --> 01:27:24,458
<font color="#696969">Who are you talking about?</font>

957
01:27:25,188 --> 01:27:28,837
<font color="#696969">Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.</font>

958
01:27:29,045 --> 01:27:30,505
<font color="#696969">Okay, very funny.</font>

959
01:27:33,633 --> 01:27:37,282
<font color="#696969">~ What was that for?
~ It's no joke! I'm in love with her!</font>

960
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:40,306
<font color="#696969">Fine, you're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her?</font>

961
01:27:41,348 --> 01:27:44,268
<font color="#696969">No. Can you introduce me?</font>

962
01:28:05,955 --> 01:28:10,751
<font color="#696969">Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you to Romilda Vane.</font>

963
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:25,139
<font color="#696969">I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential.</font>

964
01:28:26,077 --> 01:28:27,433
<font color="#696969">Where's Romilda?</font>

965
01:28:27,641 --> 01:28:29,518
<font color="#696969">What's the matter with Wenby?</font>

966
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,916
<font color="#696969">Very powerful love potion.</font>

967
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:34,419
<font color="#696969">Very well. Better bring him in.</font>

968
01:28:34,627 --> 01:28:37,859
<font color="#696969">I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry.</font>

969
01:28:38,068 --> 01:28:40,987
<font color="#696969">Well, I thought this called for a more practiced hand, sir.</font>

970
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:44,219
<font color="#696969">Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?</font>

971
01:28:44,428 --> 01:28:46,096
<font color="#696969">Perhaps you're right.</font>

972
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:56,001
<font color="#696969">I'm sorry, by the way, professor, about earlier today, our misunderstanding.</font>

973
01:28:56,210 --> 01:29:00,589
<font color="#696969">Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?</font>

974
01:29:00,693 --> 01:29:03,612
<font color="#696969">I expect you're tired of it after all these years.</font>

975
01:29:03,821 --> 01:29:06,428
<font color="#696969">All the questions about Voldemort.</font>

976
01:29:06,532 --> 01:29:08,409
<font color="#696969">Don't use that name.</font>

977
01:29:16,124 --> 01:29:18,209
<font color="#696969">There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.</font>

978
01:29:18,418 --> 01:29:21,441
<font color="#696969">~ What's this?
~ Tonic for the nerves.</font>

979
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:38,332
<font color="#696969">~ What happened to me?
~ Love potion.</font>

980
01:29:38,436 --> 01:29:40,626
<font color="#696969">A bloody strong one at that.</font>

981
01:29:41,147 --> 01:29:44,797
<font color="#696969">~ I feel really bad.
~ You need a pick-me-up.</font>

982
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:48,654
<font color="#696969">Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.</font>

983
01:29:48,863 --> 01:29:53,138
<font color="#696969">I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances....</font>

984
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:57,100
<font color="#696969">Here we are, Potter.</font>

985
01:29:57,308 --> 01:29:58,768
<font color="#696969">To life!</font>

986
01:30:03,668 --> 01:30:04,607
<font color="#696969">Ron.</font>

987
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:10,550
<font color="#696969">Ron. Professor, do something.</font>

988
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:13,261
<font color="#696969">I don't understand.</font>

989
01:30:29,734 --> 01:30:31,507
<font color="#696969">Come on, Ron, breathe.</font>

990
01:30:53,715 --> 01:30:56,530
<font color="#696969">These girls, they're gonna kill me.</font>

991
01:31:07,582 --> 01:31:10,918
<font color="#696969">Quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar.</font>

992
01:31:11,127 --> 01:31:13,421
<font color="#696969">You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.</font>

993
01:31:13,629 --> 01:31:17,070
<font color="#696969">Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.</font>

994
01:31:17,278 --> 01:31:19,989
<font color="#696969">I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.</font>

995
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:24,160
<font color="#696969">The question is,
why were they necessary?</font>

996
01:31:24,368 --> 01:31:26,037
<font color="#696969">Why, indeed?</font>

997
01:31:26,245 --> 01:31:28,226
<font color="#696969">This appears to be a gift, Horace.</font>

998
01:31:28,539 --> 01:31:31,354
<font color="#696969">You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?</font>

999
01:31:31,563 --> 01:31:35,525
<font color="#696969">Which, by the way, possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry....</font>

1000
01:31:35,733 --> 01:31:38,131
<font color="#696969">....when not polluted with poison.</font>

1001
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:41,468
<font color="#696969">Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.</font>

1002
01:31:41,676 --> 01:31:43,032
<font color="#696969">To whom, I might ask?</font>

1003
01:31:44,804 --> 01:31:46,994
<font color="#696969">To you, Headmaster.</font>

1004
01:31:49,392 --> 01:31:50,434
<font color="#696969">Where is he?</font>

1005
01:31:50,643 --> 01:31:54,709
<font color="#696969">Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?</font>

1006
01:31:57,733 --> 01:31:59,401
<font color="#696969">What's she doing here?</font>

1007
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:01,799
<font color="#696969">I might ask you the same question.</font>

1008
01:32:02,008 --> 01:32:04,301
<font color="#696969">I happen to be his girlfriend.</font>

1009
01:32:04,406 --> 01:32:07,221
<font color="#696969">I happen to be his friend.</font>

1010
01:32:07,325 --> 01:32:11,600
<font color="#696969">Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.</font>

1011
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:15,249
<font color="#696969">I suppose you want to make up now that he's all interesting.</font>

1012
01:32:15,458 --> 01:32:19,107
<font color="#696969">He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!</font>

1013
01:32:19,315 --> 01:32:22,130
<font color="#696969">And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.</font>

1014
01:32:23,799 --> 01:32:28,803
<font color="#696969">Ah. See? He senses my presence.</font>

1015
01:32:29,012 --> 01:32:32,244
<font color="#696969">Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.</font>

1016
01:32:32,974 --> 01:32:34,746
<font color="#696969">I'm here.</font>

1017
01:32:40,689 --> 01:32:43,817
<font color="#696969">Uh....Hermione....</font>

1018
01:32:47,884 --> 01:32:49,865
<font color="#696969">Hermione.</font>

1019
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:52,888
<font color="#696969">Hermione.</font>

1020
01:33:00,499 --> 01:33:04,357
<font color="#696969">Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.</font>

1021
01:33:04,774 --> 01:33:07,068
<font color="#696969">Well, come away, everybody.</font>

1022
01:33:07,277 --> 01:33:09,883
<font color="#696969">Mr. Weasley is well tended.</font>

1023
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:16,660
<font color="#696969">About time, don't you think?</font>

1024
01:33:19,371 --> 01:33:20,935
<font color="#696969">Thank you.</font>

1025
01:33:23,854 --> 01:33:25,627
<font color="#696969">Oh, shut up.</font>

1026
01:35:37,938 --> 01:35:41,795
<font color="#696969">Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.</font>

1027
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:48,885
<font color="#696969">Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.</font>

1028
01:35:49,719 --> 01:35:52,534
<font color="#696969">Um, well....</font>

1029
01:35:52,743 --> 01:35:55,767
<font color="#696969">....she came to visit you
in the hospital.</font>

1030
01:35:56,601 --> 01:35:58,999
<font color="#696969">And you talked.</font>

1031
01:36:00,667 --> 01:36:04,733
<font color="#696969">I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.</font>

1032
01:36:04,838 --> 01:36:08,174
<font color="#696969">Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.</font>

1033
01:36:08,383 --> 01:36:10,676
<font color="#696969">It's just she seems a bit put out.</font>

1034
01:36:17,141 --> 01:36:20,686
<font color="#696969">Yes, she does, doesn't she?</font>

1035
01:36:22,354 --> 01:36:27,358
<font color="#696969">You say you don't remember
anything from that night?</font>

1036
01:36:27,567 --> 01:36:30,486
<font color="#696969">Anything at all?</font>

1037
01:36:30,695 --> 01:36:32,467
<font color="#696969">There is something.</font>

1038
01:36:36,012 --> 01:36:40,496
<font color="#696969">But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?</font>

1039
01:36:41,955 --> 01:36:45,188
<font color="#696969">Right. Boggled.</font>

1040
01:36:52,486 --> 01:36:53,737
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1041
01:36:55,197 --> 01:36:56,344
<font color="#696969">That's Katie.</font>

1042
01:36:58,325 --> 01:36:59,889
<font color="#696969">Katie Bell.</font>

1043
01:37:07,604 --> 01:37:10,002
<font color="#696969">Katie. How are you?</font>

1044
01:37:10,628 --> 01:37:15,111
<font color="#696969">I know you're going to ask, Harry, but I don't know who cursed me.</font>

1045
01:37:16,779 --> 01:37:20,324
<font color="#696969">I've been trying to remember, honestly.</font>

1046
01:37:20,741 --> 01:37:24,182
<font color="#696969">But I just can't.</font>

1047
01:37:37,424 --> 01:37:38,779
<font color="#696969">Katie?</font>

1048
01:38:21,214 --> 01:38:25,281
<font color="#696969">I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her, didn't you?</font>

1049
01:38:55,621 --> 01:38:57,602
<font color="#696969">Sectumsempra!</font>

1050
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:47,545
<font color="#696969">Vulnera Sanentur.</font>

1051
01:39:49,213 --> 01:39:52,028
<font color="#696969">Vulnera Sanentur.</font>

1052
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:57,241
<font color="#696969">Vulnera Sanentur.</font>

1053
01:40:18,302 --> 01:40:21,847
<font color="#696969">You have to get rid of it. Today.</font>

1054
01:40:26,748 --> 01:40:28,312
<font color="#696969">Take my hand.</font>

1055
01:40:44,368 --> 01:40:46,245
<font color="#696969">The Room of Requirement.</font>

1056
01:40:52,709 --> 01:40:55,316
<font color="#696969">We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book....</font>

1057
01:40:55,525 --> 01:40:59,174
<font color="#696969">....where no one will ever find it, including you.</font>

1058
01:41:07,619 --> 01:41:08,975
<font color="#696969">~ What was that?
~ What was that?</font>

1059
01:41:35,145 --> 01:41:36,500
<font color="#696969">See?</font>

1060
01:41:37,022 --> 01:41:39,003
<font color="#696969">You never know what you'll find up here.</font>

1061
01:41:58,187 --> 01:42:02,149
<font color="#696969">All right, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted.</font>

1062
01:42:06,007 --> 01:42:07,675
<font color="#696969">Close your eyes.</font>

1063
01:42:34,367 --> 01:42:37,182
<font color="#696969">That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.</font>

1064
01:42:51,883 --> 01:42:54,281
<font color="#696969">So did you and Ginny do it, then?</font>

1065
01:42:54,385 --> 01:42:55,532
<font color="#696969">What?</font>

1066
01:42:55,741 --> 01:42:57,826
<font color="#696969">You know, hide the book?</font>

1067
01:42:58,034 --> 01:42:59,911
<font color="#696969">Oh, yeah.</font>

1068
01:43:02,831 --> 01:43:05,333
<font color="#696969">Ah. Dear, yes.</font>

1069
01:43:05,541 --> 01:43:08,356
<font color="#696969">Still no luck with Slughorn, then, I take it?</font>

1070
01:43:10,442 --> 01:43:11,693
<font color="#696969">Luck.</font>

1071
01:43:12,736 --> 01:43:16,072
<font color="#696969">That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.</font>

1072
01:43:34,214 --> 01:43:37,446
<font color="#696969">Well, how do you feel?</font>

1073
01:43:37,655 --> 01:43:39,219
<font color="#696969">Excellent.</font>

1074
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:42,451
<font color="#696969">Really excellent.</font>

1075
01:43:45,162 --> 01:43:46,726
<font color="#696969">Remember....</font>

1076
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:48,811
<font color="#696969">....Slughorn usually eats early....</font>

1077
01:43:49,019 --> 01:43:52,043
<font color="#696969">....takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.</font>

1078
01:43:52,147 --> 01:43:53,711
<font color="#696969">Right.</font>

1079
01:43:54,128 --> 01:43:56,214
<font color="#696969">~ I'm going down to Hagrid's.
~ What?</font>

1080
01:43:56,422 --> 01:43:59,133
<font color="#696969">No, Harry, you've got to go and speak to Slughorn.</font>

1081
01:44:00,697 --> 01:44:03,303
<font color="#696969">~ We have a plan.
~ I know....</font>

1082
01:44:03,408 --> 01:44:05,493
<font color="#696969">....but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.</font>

1083
01:44:05,701 --> 01:44:09,455
<font color="#696969">I feel it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean?</font>

1084
01:44:10,289 --> 01:44:12,583
<font color="#696969">~ No.
~ Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.</font>

1085
01:44:12,791 --> 01:44:14,877
<font color="#696969">Or Felix does.</font>

1086
01:44:16,024 --> 01:44:17,483
<font color="#696969">Hi!</font>

1087
01:44:48,137 --> 01:44:49,805
<font color="#696969">Merlin's beard, Harry!</font>

1088
01:44:50,014 --> 01:44:54,184
<font color="#696969">Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat, coughed.</font>

1089
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:56,269
<font color="#696969">You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.</font>

1090
01:44:56,478 --> 01:44:59,814
<font color="#696969">Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?</font>

1091
01:45:00,023 --> 01:45:02,108
<font color="#696969">Well, just the general behavior, sir.</font>

1092
01:45:02,317 --> 01:45:05,028
<font color="#696969">The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.</font>

1093
01:45:05,236 --> 01:45:08,781
<font color="#696969">Are those Tentacula leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they?</font>

1094
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:11,283
<font color="#696969">Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.</font>

1095
01:45:11,492 --> 01:45:15,037
<font color="#696969">Not that I'm familiar with any such transactions, but one does hear rumors.</font>

1096
01:45:15,141 --> 01:45:18,999
<font color="#696969">My own interests
are purely academic, of course.</font>

1097
01:45:19,103 --> 01:45:22,440
<font color="#696969">Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.</font>

1098
01:45:25,672 --> 01:45:27,861
<font color="#696969">How did you get out of the castle, Harry?</font>

1099
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:29,529
<font color="#696969">Through the front door, sir.</font>

1100
01:45:29,738 --> 01:45:31,823
<font color="#696969">I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend....</font>

1101
01:45:32,032 --> 01:45:33,700
<font color="#696969">....and I fancied paying him a visit.</font>

1102
01:45:33,909 --> 01:45:36,202
<font color="#696969">So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.</font>

1103
01:45:37,036 --> 01:45:38,600
<font color="#696969">Harry!</font>

1104
01:45:39,435 --> 01:45:41,937
<font color="#696969">~ Sir?
~ It's nearly nightfall.</font>

1105
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:45,482
<font color="#696969">Surely you realize I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself.</font>

1106
01:45:45,690 --> 01:45:48,297
<font color="#696969">Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.</font>

1107
01:45:53,614 --> 01:45:56,847
<font color="#696969">Harry, I must insist
you accompany me....</font>

1108
01:45:57,055 --> 01:45:58,723
<font color="#696969">....back to the castle immediately!</font>

1109
01:45:58,932 --> 01:46:02,164
<font color="#696969">That would be counterproductive, sir.</font>

1110
01:46:03,519 --> 01:46:05,605
<font color="#696969">And what makes you say that?</font>

1111
01:46:06,752 --> 01:46:08,316
<font color="#696969">No idea.</font>

1112
01:46:15,093 --> 01:46:16,448
<font color="#696969">Horace.</font>

1113
01:46:17,074 --> 01:46:22,391
<font color="#696969">Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?</font>

1114
01:46:23,017 --> 01:46:25,102
<font color="#696969">A dead one, I think, sir.</font>

1115
01:46:25,832 --> 01:46:27,396
<font color="#696969">Good God.</font>

1116
01:46:28,021 --> 01:46:31,149
<font color="#696969">Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?</font>

1117
01:46:31,462 --> 01:46:34,903
<font color="#696969">Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.</font>

1118
01:46:35,007 --> 01:46:39,282
<font color="#696969">~ I'm so sorry, I didn't....
~ Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.</font>

1119
01:46:39,803 --> 01:46:43,244
<font color="#696969">Seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are.</font>

1120
01:46:43,348 --> 01:46:45,538
<font color="#696969">It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.</font>

1121
01:46:46,059 --> 01:46:47,936
<font color="#696969">Not to mention the pincers.</font>

1122
01:46:52,315 --> 01:46:54,192
<font color="#696969">Yeah, I reckon that too.</font>

1123
01:46:54,921 --> 01:46:58,258
<font color="#696969">Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate....</font>

1124
01:46:58,466 --> 01:47:02,533
<font color="#696969">....but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.</font>

1125
01:47:02,741 --> 01:47:04,931
<font color="#696969">Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?</font>

1126
01:47:05,139 --> 01:47:07,746
<font color="#696969">Purely for academic purposes, you understand.</font>

1127
01:47:07,954 --> 01:47:10,769
<font color="#696969">Well, I don't suppose it's going to do him much good now, is it?</font>

1128
01:47:10,978 --> 01:47:12,229
<font color="#696969">My thoughts exactly.</font>

1129
01:47:12,333 --> 01:47:18,902
<font color="#696969">Always have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occasions as this.</font>

1130
01:47:19,111 --> 01:47:24,115
<font color="#696969">Old Potions Master's habit, you know.</font>

1131
01:47:24,845 --> 01:47:27,243
<font color="#696969">I wish you could've seen him in his prime.</font>

1132
01:47:27,452 --> 01:47:31,101
<font color="#696969">Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.</font>

1133
01:47:32,561 --> 01:47:34,125
<font color="#696969">Oh, dear.</font>

1134
01:47:43,821 --> 01:47:47,053
<font color="#696969">~ Would you like me to say a few words?
~ Yes.</font>

1135
01:47:47,262 --> 01:47:48,826
<font color="#696969">He had a family, I trust?</font>

1136
01:47:49,034 --> 01:47:50,494
<font color="#696969">Oh, yeah.</font>

1137
01:47:55,811 --> 01:47:57,271
<font color="#696969">Farewell....</font>

1138
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,356
<font color="#696969">Aragog.</font>

1139
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,759
<font color="#696969">Farewell, Aragog....</font>

1140
01:48:07,176 --> 01:48:09,887
<font color="#696969">....king of the arachnids.</font>

1141
01:48:10,721 --> 01:48:13,223
<font color="#696969">Your body will decay....</font>

1142
01:48:14,475 --> 01:48:17,290
<font color="#696969">....but your spirit lingers on.</font>

1143
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:24,692
<font color="#696969">And your human friends find solace in the loss they have sustained.</font>

1144
01:48:39,915 --> 01:48:43,460
<font color="#696969">I had him from an egg, you know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.</font>

1145
01:48:43,668 --> 01:48:47,318
<font color="#696969">No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.</font>

1146
01:48:47,526 --> 01:48:52,739
<font color="#696969">How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. He was very dear to me.</font>

1147
01:48:52,844 --> 01:48:58,057
<font color="#696969">One afternoon I came downstairs, and he'd vanished.</font>

1148
01:48:58,265 --> 01:48:59,829
<font color="#696969">Poof.</font>

1149
01:48:59,934 --> 01:49:03,166
<font color="#696969">~ That's very odd, isn't it?
~ It is, isn't it?</font>

1150
01:49:03,374 --> 01:49:07,023
<font color="#696969">But that's life, I suppose.</font>

1151
01:49:07,232 --> 01:49:12,549
<font color="#696969">You go along and then suddenly, poof!</font>

1152
01:49:12,758 --> 01:49:16,407
<font color="#696969">~ Poof.
~ Poof.</font>

1153
01:49:31,004 --> 01:49:34,028
<font color="#696969">It was a student who gave me Francis.</font>

1154
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:39,345
<font color="#696969">One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk....</font>

1155
01:49:40,284 --> 01:49:43,203
<font color="#696969">....with just a few inches
of clear water in it.</font>

1156
01:49:44,037 --> 01:49:47,582
<font color="#696969">And floating on the surface was a flower petal.</font>

1157
01:49:49,146 --> 01:49:51,544
<font color="#696969">As I watched, it sank.</font>

1158
01:49:53,108 --> 01:49:55,923
<font color="#696969">Just before it reached the bottom....</font>

1159
01:49:56,132 --> 01:49:57,591
<font color="#696969">....it transformed....</font>

1160
01:49:58,947 --> 01:50:00,719
<font color="#696969">....into a wee fish.</font>

1161
01:50:02,492 --> 01:50:04,577
<font color="#696969">It was beautiful magic.</font>

1162
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:07,809
<font color="#696969">Wondrous to behold.</font>

1163
01:50:10,416 --> 01:50:13,231
<font color="#696969">The flower petal had come from a lily.</font>

1164
01:50:15,629 --> 01:50:16,567
<font color="#696969">Your mother.</font>

1165
01:50:18,653 --> 01:50:21,155
<font color="#696969">The day I came downstairs....</font>

1166
01:50:22,093 --> 01:50:24,387
<font color="#696969">....the day the bowl was empty....</font>

1167
01:50:25,951 --> 01:50:28,141
<font color="#696969">....was the day your mother....</font>

1168
01:50:32,103 --> 01:50:34,084
<font color="#696969">I know why you're here.</font>

1169
01:50:37,107 --> 01:50:39,088
<font color="#696969">But I can't help you.</font>

1170
01:50:40,965 --> 01:50:42,633
<font color="#696969">It would ruin me.</font>

1171
01:50:46,387 --> 01:50:48,785
<font color="#696969">Do you know why I survived, professor?</font>

1172
01:50:49,410 --> 01:50:51,183
<font color="#696969">The night I got this?</font>

1173
01:50:52,955 --> 01:50:54,519
<font color="#696969">Because of her.</font>

1174
01:50:55,458 --> 01:50:57,230
<font color="#696969">Because she sacrificed herself.</font>

1175
01:50:57,751 --> 01:51:00,045
<font color="#696969">Because she refused to step aside.</font>

1176
01:51:00,254 --> 01:51:03,486
<font color="#696969">Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.</font>

1177
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:07,344
<font color="#696969">~ Don't say his name.
~ I'm not afraid of the name, professor.</font>

1178
01:51:08,178 --> 01:51:10,263
<font color="#696969">I'm going to tell you something.</font>

1179
01:51:11,201 --> 01:51:14,121
<font color="#696969">Something others have only guessed at.</font>

1180
01:51:16,102 --> 01:51:17,666
<font color="#696969">It's true.</font>

1181
01:51:18,187 --> 01:51:19,543
<font color="#696969">I am the Chosen One.</font>

1182
01:51:20,481 --> 01:51:22,670
<font color="#696969">Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so....</font>

1183
01:51:22,879 --> 01:51:26,215
<font color="#696969">....I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you years ago in your office....</font>

1184
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,718
<font color="#696969">....and I need to know what you told him.</font>

1185
01:51:29,448 --> 01:51:31,846
<font color="#696969">Be brave, professor.</font>

1186
01:51:33,514 --> 01:51:35,599
<font color="#696969">Be brave like my mother.</font>

1187
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:39,561
<font color="#696969">Otherwise, you disgrace her.</font>

1188
01:51:40,708 --> 01:51:42,898
<font color="#696969">Otherwise, she died for nothing.</font>

1189
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:49,153
<font color="#696969">Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.</font>

1190
01:51:59,684 --> 01:52:02,812
<font color="#696969">Please, don't think badly of me when you see it.</font>

1191
01:52:04,897 --> 01:52:08,129
<font color="#696969">You've no idea what he was like, even then.</font>

1192
01:52:44,934 --> 01:52:47,541
<font color="#696969">I was in the library the other night....</font>

1193
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:49,939
<font color="#696969">....in the Restricted Section....</font>

1194
01:52:50,773 --> 01:52:54,422
<font color="#696969">....and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.</font>

1195
01:52:55,778 --> 01:52:58,489
<font color="#696969">It's called, as I understand it....</font>

1196
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:01,095
<font color="#696969">....a Horcrux.</font>

1197
01:53:02,972 --> 01:53:05,683
<font color="#696969">~ I beg your pardon?
~ Horcrux.</font>

1198
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:08,811
<font color="#696969">I came across the term while reading....</font>

1199
01:53:08,915 --> 01:53:11,939
<font color="#696969">....and I didn't fully understand it.</font>

1200
01:53:12,147 --> 01:53:13,816
<font color="#696969">I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom....</font>

1201
01:53:14,024 --> 01:53:16,631
<font color="#696969">....but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.</font>

1202
01:53:16,839 --> 01:53:18,299
<font color="#696969">Which is....</font>

1203
01:53:19,446 --> 01:53:21,322
<font color="#696969">....why I came to you.</font>

1204
01:53:24,138 --> 01:53:29,768
<font color="#696969">A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.</font>

1205
01:53:29,976 --> 01:53:32,583
<font color="#696969">But I don't understand
how that works, sir.</font>

1206
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:39,152
<font color="#696969">One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.</font>

1207
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:42,905
<font color="#696969">By doing so, you're protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed.</font>

1208
01:53:43,114 --> 01:53:44,260
<font color="#696969">Protected?</font>

1209
01:53:44,365 --> 01:53:47,597
<font color="#696969">That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.</font>

1210
01:53:49,057 --> 01:53:51,455
<font color="#696969">In other words, you cannot die.</font>

1211
01:53:58,649 --> 01:54:01,777
<font color="#696969">And how does one split his soul, sir?</font>

1212
01:54:01,985 --> 01:54:04,800
<font color="#696969">I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.</font>

1213
01:54:06,052 --> 01:54:07,511
<font color="#696969">Murder.</font>

1214
01:54:08,033 --> 01:54:09,284
<font color="#696969">Yes.</font>

1215
01:54:09,909 --> 01:54:14,810
<font color="#696969">Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature.</font>

1216
01:54:15,644 --> 01:54:20,440
<font color="#696969">Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven....?</font>

1217
01:54:20,649 --> 01:54:22,108
<font color="#696969">Seven?</font>

1218
01:54:22,838 --> 01:54:28,155
<font color="#696969">Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person?</font>

1219
01:54:28,364 --> 01:54:32,013
<font color="#696969">To rip the soul into seven pieces....</font>

1220
01:54:33,264 --> 01:54:36,288
<font color="#696969">This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic?</font>

1221
01:54:41,084 --> 01:54:42,335
<font color="#696969">Of course, sir.</font>

1222
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:47,340
<font color="#696969">It'll be our little secret.</font>

1223
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,349
<font color="#696969">Sir.</font>

1224
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,866
<font color="#696969">This is beyond anything I imagined.</font>

1225
01:55:15,074 --> 01:55:17,785
<font color="#696969">You mean to say he succeeded, sir, in making a Horcrux?</font>

1226
01:55:17,889 --> 01:55:21,017
<font color="#696969">Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right. And not just once.</font>

1227
01:55:21,226 --> 01:55:22,268
<font color="#696969">What are they exactly?</font>

1228
01:55:22,373 --> 01:55:25,709
<font color="#696969">Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.</font>

1229
01:55:28,941 --> 01:55:30,609
<font color="#696969">A ring, for example.</font>

1230
01:55:31,235 --> 01:55:32,695
<font color="#696969">Or a book.</font>

1231
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:36,448
<font color="#696969">~ Tom Riddle's diary.
~ It's a Horcrux, yes.</font>

1232
01:55:36,969 --> 01:55:39,055
<font color="#696969">Four years ago, when you saved Ginny's life....</font>

1233
01:55:39,263 --> 01:55:41,453
<font color="#696969">....in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this.</font>

1234
01:55:41,661 --> 01:55:43,538
<font color="#696969">I knew this was
a different kind of magic.</font>

1235
01:55:43,747 --> 01:55:48,751
<font color="#696969">Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight I had no idea just how powerful.</font>

1236
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,941
<font color="#696969">~ The ring?
~ Belonged to Voldemort's mother.</font>

1237
01:55:51,358 --> 01:55:56,050
<font color="#696969">Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.</font>

1238
01:55:56,258 --> 01:56:00,116
<font color="#696969">But if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux....</font>

1239
01:56:00,325 --> 01:56:01,471
<font color="#696969">One destroys Voldemort.</font>

1240
01:56:01,576 --> 01:56:04,495
<font color="#696969">But how would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere.</font>

1241
01:56:04,704 --> 01:56:07,936
<font color="#696969">True. But magic, especially dark magic....</font>

1242
01:56:21,907 --> 01:56:23,784
<font color="#696969">....leaves traces.</font>

1243
01:56:31,604 --> 01:56:33,689
<font color="#696969">It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?</font>

1244
01:56:33,897 --> 01:56:36,087
<font color="#696969">~ When you leave the school?
~ Yes.</font>

1245
01:56:37,025 --> 01:56:40,049
<font color="#696969">And I think perhaps
I may have found another.</font>

1246
01:56:40,258 --> 01:56:44,324
<font color="#696969">But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.</font>

1247
01:56:45,888 --> 01:56:50,475
<font color="#696969">Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.</font>

1248
01:56:54,542 --> 01:56:56,731
<font color="#696969">Have you ever considered
that you ask too much....</font>

1249
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:59,546
<font color="#696969">....that you take too much for granted?</font>

1250
01:56:59,755 --> 01:57:04,759
<font color="#696969">Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?</font>

1251
01:57:04,968 --> 01:57:07,053
<font color="#696969">Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.</font>

1252
01:57:07,992 --> 01:57:13,726
<font color="#696969">I will not negotiate with you, Severus. You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.</font>

1253
01:57:32,181 --> 01:57:33,745
<font color="#696969">Oh, Harry.</font>

1254
01:57:36,351 --> 01:57:38,645
<font color="#696969">You need a shave, my friend.</font>

1255
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:45,735
<font color="#696969">You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.</font>

1256
01:57:45,839 --> 01:57:49,801
<font color="#696969">At times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard.</font>

1257
01:57:51,365 --> 01:57:53,763
<font color="#696969">Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.</font>

1258
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:55,744
<font color="#696969">I'm an old man.</font>

1259
01:57:55,849 --> 01:57:57,517
<font color="#696969">You still look the same to me, sir.</font>

1260
01:57:58,977 --> 01:58:02,000
<font color="#696969">Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.</font>

1261
01:58:02,209 --> 01:58:05,337
<font color="#696969">A trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid.</font>

1262
01:58:08,152 --> 01:58:12,635
<font color="#696969">The place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous.</font>

1263
01:58:12,844 --> 01:58:16,284
<font color="#696969">I promised you could accompany me, and I stand by that promise.</font>

1264
01:58:16,493 --> 01:58:18,265
<font color="#696969">But there is one condition:</font>

1265
01:58:18,474 --> 01:58:21,706
<font color="#696969">You must obey every command I give you, without question.</font>

1266
01:58:22,540 --> 01:58:24,208
<font color="#696969">Yes, sir.</font>

1267
01:58:24,417 --> 01:58:26,502
<font color="#696969">You do understand what I'm saying?</font>

1268
01:58:27,128 --> 01:58:29,526
<font color="#696969">Should I tell you to hide, you hide.</font>

1269
01:58:29,734 --> 01:58:32,028
<font color="#696969">Should I tell you to run, you run.</font>

1270
01:58:32,237 --> 01:58:36,199
<font color="#696969">Should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so.</font>

1271
01:58:41,412 --> 01:58:42,976
<font color="#696969">Your word, Harry.</font>

1272
01:58:44,644 --> 01:58:46,104
<font color="#696969">My word.</font>

1273
01:58:46,938 --> 01:58:48,606
<font color="#696969">Take my arm.</font>

1274
01:58:50,066 --> 01:58:52,464
<font color="#696969">Sir, I thought you couldn't apparate within Hogwarts.</font>

1275
01:58:53,089 --> 01:58:56,530
<font color="#696969">Well, being me has its privileges.</font>

1276
01:59:43,866 --> 01:59:45,430
<font color="#696969">This is the place.</font>

1277
01:59:46,264 --> 01:59:47,828
<font color="#696969">Oh, yes.</font>

1278
01:59:48,766 --> 01:59:51,269
<font color="#696969">This place has known magic.</font>

1279
01:59:59,297 --> 02:00:00,861
<font color="#696969">~ Sir!
~ In order to gain passage....</font>

1280
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:02,425
<font color="#696969">....payment must be made.</font>

1281
02:00:02,633 --> 02:00:06,282
<font color="#696969">Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.</font>

1282
02:00:07,846 --> 02:00:09,619
<font color="#696969">~ You should've let me, sir.
~ No, Harry.</font>

1283
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:12,851
<font color="#696969">Your blood's much more precious than mine.</font>

1284
02:00:34,746 --> 02:00:39,334
<font color="#696969">Voldemort will not have made it easy to discover his hiding place.</font>

1285
02:00:39,543 --> 02:00:42,879
<font color="#696969">He will have put certain defenses in position.</font>

1286
02:00:45,486 --> 02:00:46,841
<font color="#696969">Careful.</font>

1287
02:01:10,405 --> 02:01:11,552
<font color="#696969">There it is.</font>

1288
02:01:13,011 --> 02:01:15,722
<font color="#696969">The only question is,
how do we get there?</font>

1289
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:39,703
<font color="#696969">If you would, Harry.</font>

1290
02:02:27,038 --> 02:02:29,436
<font color="#696969">Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?</font>

1291
02:02:30,062 --> 02:02:31,418
<font color="#696969">Oh, yes.</font>

1292
02:02:42,574 --> 02:02:44,138
<font color="#696969">It has to be drunk.</font>

1293
02:02:44,346 --> 02:02:47,161
<font color="#696969">All of it has to be drunk.</font>

1294
02:02:47,995 --> 02:02:51,332
<font color="#696969">You remember the conditions on which I brought you with me?</font>

1295
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:53,938
<font color="#696969">This potion might paralyze me.</font>

1296
02:02:54,356 --> 02:02:56,024
<font color="#696969">Might make me forget why I'm here.</font>

1297
02:02:56,754 --> 02:03:00,090
<font color="#696969">Might cause me so much pain that I beg for relief.</font>

1298
02:03:00,299 --> 02:03:02,280
<font color="#696969">You are not to indulge these requests.</font>

1299
02:03:02,384 --> 02:03:05,929
<font color="#696969">It's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion.</font>

1300
02:03:06,137 --> 02:03:08,535
<font color="#696969">Even if you have to force it down my throat.</font>

1301
02:03:09,057 --> 02:03:11,142
<font color="#696969">~ Understood?
~ Why can't I drink it, sir?</font>

1302
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:16,772
<font color="#696969">Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable.</font>

1303
02:03:20,734 --> 02:03:22,715
<font color="#696969">Your good health, Harry.</font>

1304
02:03:38,876 --> 02:03:40,232
<font color="#696969">Professor.</font>

1305
02:03:42,317 --> 02:03:43,568
<font color="#696969">Professor!</font>

1306
02:03:50,241 --> 02:03:51,701
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1307
02:03:51,909 --> 02:03:54,411
<font color="#696969">Professor, can you hear me?</font>

1308
02:03:55,663 --> 02:03:56,809
<font color="#696969">Professor.</font>

1309
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:13,387
<font color="#696969">No. Don't.</font>

1310
02:04:13,596 --> 02:04:15,890
<font color="#696969">You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?</font>

1311
02:04:25,169 --> 02:04:27,046
<font color="#696969">~ Stop.
~ It will stop. It will stop....</font>

1312
02:04:27,254 --> 02:04:31,633
<font color="#696969">....but only if you keep drinking.
~ Please, don't make me.</font>

1313
02:04:31,842 --> 02:04:33,927
<font color="#696969">~ I'm sorry, sir.
~ Please.</font>

1314
02:04:34,136 --> 02:04:36,325
<font color="#696969">~ Kill me. Kill me!
~ No!</font>

1315
02:04:38,306 --> 02:04:39,349
<font color="#696969">It's my fault.</font>

1316
02:04:41,017 --> 02:04:42,268
<font color="#696969">It's all my fault.</font>

1317
02:04:44,145 --> 02:04:45,709
<font color="#696969">It's my fault.</font>

1318
02:04:45,918 --> 02:04:49,254
<font color="#696969">Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise....</font>

1319
02:04:49,984 --> 02:04:52,278
<font color="#696969">....I promise I'll do what you say.</font>

1320
02:04:52,486 --> 02:04:54,259
<font color="#696969">~ I promise.
~ No.</font>

1321
02:04:55,301 --> 02:04:56,657
<font color="#696969">Please.</font>

1322
02:05:20,846 --> 02:05:22,306
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1323
02:05:29,396 --> 02:05:30,438
<font color="#696969">Water.</font>

1324
02:05:31,481 --> 02:05:32,628
<font color="#696969">Water.</font>

1325
02:05:32,732 --> 02:05:34,504
<font color="#696969">Water.</font>

1326
02:05:41,073 --> 02:05:42,846
<font color="#696969">You did it, sir.</font>

1327
02:05:43,054 --> 02:05:44,514
<font color="#696969">Look.</font>

1328
02:05:46,495 --> 02:05:47,746
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1329
02:05:49,101 --> 02:05:50,457
<font color="#696969">Water.</font>

1330
02:05:52,229 --> 02:05:53,898
<font color="#696969">Aguamenti.</font>

1331
02:05:54,106 --> 02:05:55,566
<font color="#696969">Water.</font>

1332
02:06:31,745 --> 02:06:33,101
<font color="#696969">Lumos.</font>

1333
02:07:01,565 --> 02:07:03,441
<font color="#696969">Lumos Maxima!</font>

1334
02:07:12,929 --> 02:07:14,702
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1335
02:07:18,768 --> 02:07:19,915
<font color="#696969">Sectumsempra!</font>

1336
02:07:20,124 --> 02:07:21,270
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1337
02:07:22,209 --> 02:07:23,773
<font color="#696969">~ Stupefy!
~ Harry.</font>

1338
02:08:22,995 --> 02:08:24,246
<font color="#696969">Harry.</font>

1339
02:08:28,312 --> 02:08:30,606
<font color="#696969">Partis Temporus!</font>

1340
02:09:13,145 --> 02:09:16,273
<font color="#696969">Go to your houses. No dawdling.</font>

1341
02:09:57,145 --> 02:10:00,794
<font color="#696969">We need to get you to the hospital wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.</font>

1342
02:10:03,296 --> 02:10:04,652
<font color="#696969">No.</font>

1343
02:10:05,694 --> 02:10:08,405
<font color="#696969">Severus. Severus is who I need.</font>

1344
02:10:08,509 --> 02:10:12,054
<font color="#696969">Wake him. Tell him what happened.</font>

1345
02:10:12,263 --> 02:10:13,931
<font color="#696969">Speak to no one else.</font>

1346
02:10:14,557 --> 02:10:16,746
<font color="#696969">Severus, Harry.</font>

1347
02:10:22,064 --> 02:10:24,462
<font color="#696969">Hide yourself below, Harry.</font>

1348
02:10:25,921 --> 02:10:28,945
<font color="#696969">Don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission.</font>

1349
02:10:29,049 --> 02:10:32,907
<font color="#696969">Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.</font>

1350
02:10:33,637 --> 02:10:35,305
<font color="#696969">Harry, do as I say.</font>

1351
02:10:38,954 --> 02:10:40,205
<font color="#696969">Trust me.</font>

1352
02:10:41,978 --> 02:10:43,438
<font color="#696969">Trust me.</font>

1353
02:11:04,082 --> 02:11:05,854
<font color="#696969">Good evening, Draco.</font>

1354
02:11:06,793 --> 02:11:10,233
<font color="#696969">What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?</font>

1355
02:11:10,442 --> 02:11:12,214
<font color="#696969">Who else is here? I heard you talking.</font>

1356
02:11:12,423 --> 02:11:16,489
<font color="#696969">I often talk aloud to
myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.</font>

1357
02:11:18,575 --> 02:11:21,390
<font color="#696969">Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?</font>

1358
02:11:23,892 --> 02:11:25,352
<font color="#696969">Draco....</font>

1359
02:11:26,081 --> 02:11:29,001
<font color="#696969">....you are no assassin.
~ How do you know what I am?</font>

1360
02:11:29,209 --> 02:11:30,982
<font color="#696969">I've done things that would shock you.</font>

1361
02:11:31,190 --> 02:11:35,257
<font color="#696969">Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?</font>

1362
02:11:35,465 --> 02:11:38,072
<font color="#696969">Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?</font>

1363
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:39,844
<font color="#696969">Forgive me, Draco.</font>

1364
02:11:39,949 --> 02:11:42,451
<font color="#696969">I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak....</font>

1365
02:11:42,659 --> 02:11:45,057
<font color="#696969">....your heart can't really have been in them.</font>

1366
02:11:45,162 --> 02:11:48,394
<font color="#696969">He trusts me. I was chosen.</font>

1367
02:11:52,252 --> 02:11:54,024
<font color="#696969">Then I shall make it easy for you.</font>

1368
02:11:54,128 --> 02:11:55,797
<font color="#696969">Expelliarmus!</font>

1369
02:11:59,133 --> 02:12:01,531
<font color="#696969">Very good. Very good.</font>

1370
02:12:03,304 --> 02:12:04,659
<font color="#696969">You're not alone.</font>

1371
02:12:05,806 --> 02:12:06,849
<font color="#696969">There are others.</font>

1372
02:12:08,934 --> 02:12:10,289
<font color="#696969">How?</font>

1373
02:12:11,645 --> 02:12:14,251
<font color="#696969">The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.</font>

1374
02:12:14,981 --> 02:12:17,379
<font color="#696969">~ I've been mending it.
~ Let me guess.</font>

1375
02:12:17,588 --> 02:12:20,507
<font color="#696969">It has a sister. A twin.</font>

1376
02:12:20,716 --> 02:12:22,905
<font color="#696969">In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.</font>

1377
02:12:23,114 --> 02:12:24,886
<font color="#696969">Ingenious.</font>

1378
02:12:25,512 --> 02:12:26,763
<font color="#696969">Draco....</font>

1379
02:12:26,971 --> 02:12:33,019
<font color="#696969">....years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices.</font>

1380
02:12:33,957 --> 02:12:36,877
<font color="#696969">~ Please let me help you.
~ I don't want your help!</font>

1381
02:12:37,711 --> 02:12:41,151

<i>He pretended to congratulate</i>
<i>the three brothers on their magic...</i>

<i>So Death fashioned him one</i>
<i>from an elder tree that stood nearby.</i>

1193
01:51:33,792 --> 01:51:38,092
<i>The second brother decided he wanted</i>
<i>to humiliate Death even further...</i>

1194
01:51:38,263 --> 01:51:42,700
<i>... and asked for the power</i>
<i>to recall loved ones from the grave.</i>

1195
01:51:43,135 --> 01:51:47,435

<i>...without being followed</i> by <i>Death.</i>

1200

1201

1207

<i>... and slit the brother's throat</i>
<i>for good measure.</i>

1208
01:52:40,959 --> 01:52:44,395
<i>And so Death took the first brother</i>
<i>for his own.</i>

1209

<i>The second brother journeyed</i>
<i>to his home...</i>

We used to come here as kids.

4
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,828
The Order uses it
now as a safe house.

5
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,229
What's left of us, at least.

6
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:53,596
Muggles think these keep evil away,
but they're wrong.

7
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,040
I need to talk to the goblin.

8
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:11,184
How are you?

9
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,692
Alive.

10
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,239
You probably don't remember...

11
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,730
That I showed you to your vault the
first time you came to Gringotts?

12
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,199
Even amongst goblins you're famous,
Harry Potter.

13
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:33,639
You buried the elf.

14
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,206
Yes.

15
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,076
And brought me here.

16
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,781
You are...

17
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,020
...a very unusual wizard.

18
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,796
How did you come by this sword?

19
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,704
It's complicated.

20
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:06,505
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it
should be in her vault at Gringotts?

21
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,679
It's complicated.

22
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:16,580
The sword presented itself
to us in a moment of need.

23
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,481
We didn't steal it.

24
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,930
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's
vault identical to this one...

25
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,724
...but it is a fake.

26
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,560
It was placed there this summer.

27
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:32,237
- And she never suspected it was a fake?
- The replica is very convincing.

28
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:36,106
Only a goblin would recognize that
this is the true sword of Gryffindor.

29
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,970
Who is the acquaintance?

30
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:42,604
A Hogwarts professor. As I understand it,
he's now headmaster.

31
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,466
Snape?

32
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,152
He put a fake sword
in Bellatrix's vault?

33
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,905
Why?

34
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:54,652
There are more than a few curious
things in the vaults at Gringotts.

35
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,555
And in Madam Lestrange's
vault as well?

36
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,460
Perhaps.

37
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,273
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.

38
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,101
This is impossible.

39
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:14,178
Alone, yes. But with you, no.

40
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,775
Why should I help you?

41
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,683
I have gold. Lots of it.

42
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,882
-I have no interest in gold.
- Then what?

43
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,598
That.

44
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,959
That is my price.

45
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,183
Are you thinking there's a
Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

46
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:54,853
She was terrified when she
thought we'd been in there.

47
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,834
She kept asking you what else we'd taken.

48
00:05:56,835 --> 00:05:59,991
I bet you there's a Horcrux in there,
another piece of his soul.

49
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:03,094
Let's find it and kill it,
we're one step closer to killing him.

50
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,892
And what happens when we find it?

51
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:08,667
How are we supposed to destroy it now
you've given the sword to Griphook?

52
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,693
I'm still working on that part.

53
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,301
He's weak.

54
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,345
Yes?

55
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,183
Mr. Ollivander, I need to
ask you a few questions.

56
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,121
Anything, my boy, anything.

57
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,654
Would you mind
identifying this wand?

58
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,458
We need to know if
it's safe to use.

59
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,168
Walnut.

60
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,635
Dragon heartstring.

61
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,076
Twelve and three-quarter inches.

62
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,846
Unyie...

63
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,613
Unyielding.

64
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,954
This belonged to
Bellatrix Lestrange.

65
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,924
Treat it carefully.

66
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,925
And this?

67
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,201
Hawthorn.

68
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,132
And unicorn hair.

69
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:25,971
Ten inches. Reasonably pliant.

70
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:34,043
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

71
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,278
Was? Is it not still?

72
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:41,586
Well, perhaps not,
if you won it from him.

73
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,592
I sense its allegiance has changed.

74
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:57,174
You talk about wands as
if they have feelings...

75
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,373
...can think.

76
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:08,220
The wand chooses the wizard,
Mr. Potter.

77
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:13,725
That much has always been clear to
those of us who have studied wandlore.

78
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,295
And what do you know about
the Deathly Hallows?

79
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,300
The Elder Wand...

80
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:36,310
...the Cloak of Invisibility to
hide you from your enemies...

81
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:42,318
...and the Resurrection Stone to
bring back loved ones from the dead.

82
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:47,448
Together, they make one the master of death.

83
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:53,724
But few truly believe
that such objects exist.

84
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,560
Do you?

85
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,295
Do you believe they exist, sir?

86
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:08,443
I see no reason to put stock
into an old wives' tale.

87
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,108
You're lying.

88
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,578
You know one exists.

89
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,584
You told him about it.

90
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:21,284
You told him about the Elder Wand and
where he could go looking for it.

91
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,891
He tortured me.

92
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,402
Besides...

93
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,101
...I only conveyed rumors.

94
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,400
There's...

95
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,775
There's no telling
whether he will find it.

96
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,683
He has found it, sir.

97
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,355
We'll let you rest.

98
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,296
He's after you, Mr. Potter.

99
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,739
If it's true, what you say,
and he has the Elder Wand...

100
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,236
...I'm afraid...

101
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,745
...you really don't stand a chance.

102
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,508
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill
him before he finds me, then.

103
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,951
Are you sure that's hers?

104
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,251
Positive.

105
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,893
Well?

106
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,834
How do I look?

107
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,901
Hideous.

108
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,839
You can give that to Hermione to hold,
all right, Griphook?

109
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,858
We're relying on you.

110
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:11,059
If you get us past the guards and
into the vault, the sword's yours.

111
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,810
Madam Lestrange.

112
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,747
Good morning.

113
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:31,614
"Good morning"? "Good morning"?

114
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,920
You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not some dewy-eyed school girl.

115
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,789
Hey. Easy.

116
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:41,524
She gives us away, we might as well use
that sword to slit our own throats.

117
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,565
Understand?

118
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,228
No, he's right. I was being stupid.

119
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,996
Okay.

120
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,902
Let's do it.

121
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,443
I wish to enter my vault.

122
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,911
Identification?

123
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,544
I hardly think
that'll be necessary.

124
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,922
Madam Lestrange.

125
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,326
I don't like to be kept waiting.

126
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,500
They know.

127
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,830
They know she's an imposter.

128
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,471
They've been warned.

129
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,075
Harry?

130
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,811
What do we do, Harry?

131
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:52,229
Madam Lestrange, would you
mind presenting your wand?

132
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,394
And why should I do that?

133
00:13:54,566 --> 00:14:00,129
It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you
understand given the current climate.

134
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:03,433
No. I most certainly
do not understand.

135
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:07,443
I'm afraid I must insist.

136
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,652
HARRY Imperio.

137
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:24,323
Very well, Madam Lestrange.
If you will follow me.

138
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,699
What is that, Griphook?

139
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,437
Griphook.

140
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,917
Arresto momentum.

141
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,930
Well done, Hermione.

142
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,107
Oh, no, you look like you again.

143
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:49,578
The Thief's Downfall.
Washes away all enchantments.

144
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:50,840
Can be deadly.

145
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,643
You don't say.

146
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,810
Just out of interest,
is there any other way out of here?

147
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,649
No.

148
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,526
What the devil are all you doing down here?

149
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:03,922
Thieves!

150
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,360
- When you gave up the keys, you...
- Imperio.

151
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:19,637
That doesn't sound good.

152
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:31,387
Bloody hell.

153
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,057
That's a Ukrainian Ironbelly.

154
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,582
Here.

155
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,571
It's been trained to expect
pain when it hears the noise.

156
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,264
That's barbaric.

157
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,906
Lumos.

158
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,568
Blimey.

159
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,847
Accio Horcrux.

160
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,490
You're not trying that one again, are you?

161
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,357
That kind of magic
won't work in here.

162
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,557
Is it in here, Harry?

163
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,835
Can you feel anything?

164
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:16,152
That's it. Up there.

165
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:23,095
They've added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.

166
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,602
Give me the sword.

167
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,282
Stop moving.

168
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,145
Got it.

169
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,374
We had a deal, Griphook.

170
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,916
The cup for the sword.

171
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:24,618
I said I'd get you in. I didn't say
anything about getting you out.

172
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,310
Griphook!

173
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,147
- Thieves! Help!
-Griphook!

174
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,152
Thieves!

175
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,760
Foul little git.
Least we've still got Bogrod.

176
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,660
That's unfortunate.

177
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,836
We can't just stand here. Who's got an idea?

178
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,534
You're the brilliant one.

179
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,976
I've got something, but it's mad.

180
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,479
Reducto.

181
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,521
Well, come on, then.

182
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,225
Relashio.

183
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,815
Keep moving! Aah!

184
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:52,569
Now what?

185
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,075
Reducto.

186
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:56,712
Hold on.

187
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:10,160
That was brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.

188
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,251
We're dropping.

189
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,491
- I say we jump.
-When?

190
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,028
Now.

191
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,421
He knows. You-Know-Who.

192
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,208
He knows we broke into Gringotts.

193
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,554
He knows what we took and he
knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

194
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,524
- How is it you know?
- I saw him.

195
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,163
You let him in? Harry,
you can't do that.

196
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,892
Hermione, I can't always help it.
Well, maybe I can. I don't know.

197
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,763
Never mind. What happened?

198
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,734
Well, he's angry.

199
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:02,463
And scared too.

200
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:06,310
He knows if we find and destroy all the
Horcruxes we'll be able to kill him.

201
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,974
I reckon he'll stop at nothing to
make sure we don't find the rest.

202
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:13,446
There's more.
One of them's at Hogwarts.

203
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,313
What?

204
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,149
- You saw it?
- I saw the castle and Rowena Ravenclaw.

205
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,883
It must have to do with her.
We have to go there now.

206
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,358
We can't do that. We've got to plan.
We've got to figure it out.

207
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,657
Hermione, when have any of our
plans ever actually worked?

208
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:30,232
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.

209
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,631
He's right.

210
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:37,036
One problem: Snape's headmaster now.
We can't just walk through the front door.

211
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:41,975
Um, well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,
to Honeydukes.

212
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,479
Take the secret
passage in the cellar.

213
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,016
It's... There's something
wrong with him.

214
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:52,520
It's like, you know, in the past, I've
always been able to follow his thoughts.

215
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,558
And now everything just feels disconnected.

216
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,024
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.

217
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,355
Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying.

218
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,492
No. No, it's more
like he's wounded.

219
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,465
If anything,
he feels more dangerous.

220
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,002
VOLDEMORT

221
00:25:52,477 --> 00:25:56,987
MAN 1: They're here! MAN 2:
Search everywhere!

222
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,698
MAN 1: Look down by the stables!
You two, come with me!

223
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,848
Any sign?

224
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,425
Potter!

225
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,123
In here, Potter.

226
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,606
Did you get a look at him?

227
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,571
-For a second, I thought it was...
- I know. Dumbledore.

228
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,524
Harry?

229
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,724
I can see you in this.

230
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,471
You bloody fools. What were
you thinking coming here?

231
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,911
Have you any idea
how dangerous it is?

232
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,746
You're Aberforth,
Dumbledore's brother.

233
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,191
It's you who I've
been seeing in here.

234
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,549
You're the one who sent Dobby.

235
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,022
Where have you left him?

236
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,757
He's dead.

237
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,353
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.

238
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,466
Who gave that to you? The mirror?

239
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,267
Mundungus Fletcher,
about a year ago.

240
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,702
-Dung had no right. It belonged to...
- Sirius.

241
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,072
Albus told me.

242
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:02,874
He also told me you'd likely be hacked
off if you ever found out I had it...

243
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:07,950
...but ask yourself,
where would you be if I didn't?

244
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,618
Do you hear from the others much?
From the Order?

245
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,759
The Order's finished.

246
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,292
You-Know-Who's won.

247
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,863
Anyone who says otherwise
is kidding themselves.

248
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,557
We need to get into
Hogwarts, tonight.

249
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,697
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

250
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,531
Did he now?

251
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,139
Nice job? Easy?

252
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,243
We've been hunting Horcruxes.

253
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:37,014
We think the last one's inside the castle,
but we'll need help getting in.

254
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,712
That's not a job my brother's given you.
It's a suicide mission.

255
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,252
Do yourself a favor, boy, go home.
Live a little longer.

256
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:49,086
- Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
- What makes you think you can trust him?

257
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:52,229
You think you can believe
anything my brother told you?

258
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,996
In all the time you knew him,
did he ever mention my name?

259
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,095
Did he ever mention hers?

260
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,967
- Why should he...?
- Keep secrets? You tell me.

261
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,467
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.

262
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,739
A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes
on the word of a man...

263
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,745
...who wouldn't even tell him
where to start. You're lying!

264
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,119
Not just to me, that doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.

265
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,314
That's what a fool does.

266
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:24,393
You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter.

267
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:29,226
So I'll ask you again.
There must be a reason.

268
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,579
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.

269
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,537
I don't care that you've given up.

270
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,606
I trusted the man I knew.

271
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,811
And we need to get into the castle tonight.

272
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,492
You know what to do.

273
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,035
Where have you sent her?

274
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:09,064
You'll see soon enough.

275
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,043
That's your sister,
Ariana, isn't it?

276
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,750
She died very young, didn't she?

277
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:26,418
My brother sacrificed
many things, Mr. Potter...

278
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,082
...on his journey to find power...

279
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,524
...including Ariana.

280
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:34,830
And she was devoted to him.

281
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,867
He gave her everything...

282
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:40,565
...but time.

283
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:44,339
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

284
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,707
He did save our lives twice.

285
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,513
Kept an eye on us in that mirror.

286
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,815
That doesn't seem like
someone who's given up.

287
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,090
She's coming back.

288
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:10,959
Who's that with her?

289
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:19,300
Neville.

290
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,002
- Oh, you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.

291
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,774
This is nothing. Seamus is worse.

292
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,978
Hey, Ab, we've got a
couple more coming through.

293
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:32,222
Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.

294
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,291
That's because it never
existed till now.

295
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,727
The seven secret passages were sealed
off before the start of the year.

296
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,491
This is the only way in or out now.

297
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:42,466
The grounds are crawling with
Death Eaters and Dementors.

298
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,196
How bad is Snape as headmaster?

299
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:47,438
Hardly ever see him. It's the
Carrows you need to watch out for.

300
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,522
Carrows?

301
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,143
Yeah. Brother and sister.
In charge of discipline.

302
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,049
They like punishment, the Carrows.

303
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,202
They did that to you? Why?

304
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:59,042
Today's Dark Arts lessons had us
practicing the Cruciatus Curse.

305
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,117
On first-years.

306
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:03,116
I refused.

307
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:06,048
Hogwarts has changed.

308
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:21,404
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

309
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,446
Hey, listen up, you lot.
Brought you a surprise.

310
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,710
Not more of Aberforth's cooking, I hope.
Be a surprise if we can digest it.

311
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,646
Blimey.

312
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:40,154
- Harry!
- Yeah!

313
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,727
Get the word out to Remus and
the others that Harry's back.

314
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:58,175
Okay, let's not kill him
before You-Know-Who...

315
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,700
River, D.A. calling. Do you read?

316
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,903
Lightning has struck.

317
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,741
What's the plan, Harry?

318
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,670
Okay.

319
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,715
There's something we need to find.

320
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:18,851
Something hidden here in the castle.
And it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.

321
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,827
Right. What is it?

322
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,158
We don't know.

323
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,036
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.

324
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,637
- I realize it's not much to go on.
- That's nothing to go on.

325
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,277
I think it has something
to do with Ravenclaw.

326
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:39,109
Um, it'll be small,
easily concealed.

327
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,111
Anyone, any ideas?

328
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,945
Well, there's Rowena
Ravenclaw's lost diadem.

329
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,523
Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.

330
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,752
Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?

331
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,195
Hasn't anyone heard of it?
It's quite famous.

332
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,733
Yes, but, Luna, it's lost,
for centuries now.

333
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,701
There isn't a person alive
today who's seen it.

334
00:34:01,702 --> 00:34:04,241
Excuse me. Can someone tell
me what a bloody diadem is?

335
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,972
It's a sort of crown.
You know, like a tiara.

336
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,510
Harry.

337
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:14,080
Hi there.

338
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:20,490
Six months she hasn't seen me and
it's like I'm Frankie First-Year.

339
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,301
- I'm her brother.
- Got lots of those.

340
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:24,724
- There's only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus.

341
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:26,385
What is it, Ginny?

342
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:30,762
Snape knows. He knows that
Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.

343
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:15,377
Many of you are surely wondering why
I have summoned you at this hour.

344
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:21,614
It's come to my attention
that earlier this evening...

345
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,318
...Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.

346
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,417
Now...

347
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:31,185
...should anyone...

348
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:38,096
...student or staff,
attempt to aid Mr. Potter...

349
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:41,363
...they will be punished...

350
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,999
...in a matter consistent with the
severity of their transgression.

351
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,407
Furthermore...

352
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:53,443
...any person found to have
knowledge of these events...

353
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,721
...who fails to come forward...

354
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:04,219
...will be treated as...

355
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:08,092
...equally guilty.

356
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,232
Now then...

357
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,799
...if anyone here...

358
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:24,441
...has any knowledge of Mr.
Potter's movements this evening...

359
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,552
...I invite them to step forward...

360
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,786
...now.

361
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:54,343
It seems, despite your exhaustive
defensive strategies...

362
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,282
...you still have a bit of a
security problem, headmaster.

363
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:03,676
And I'm afraid it's
quite extensive.

364
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,515
How dare you stand where he stood?

365
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,252
Tell them how it
happened that night.

366
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:14,956
Tell them how you looked him in the eye,
a man who trusted you, and killed him.

367
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,993
Tell them.

368
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:42,909
Coward!

369
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,437
Harry.

370
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,733
Potter?

371
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:36,938
I know that many of you
will want to fight.

372
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:42,142
Some of you may even think
that to fight is wise.

373
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,613
But this is folly.

374
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,923
Give me Harry Potter.

375
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:54,058
Do this and none shall be harmed.

376
00:38:54,231 --> 00:39:00,261
Give me Harry Potter and I
shall leave Hogwarts untouched.

377
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:03,372
Give me Harry Potter...

378
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:07,477
...and you will be rewarded.

379
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,240
You have one hour.

380
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,959
What are you waiting for?

381
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,458
Someone grab him.

382
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,304
Students out of bed.

383
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:38,370
Students out of bed!

384
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,100
Students in the corridor!

385
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:43,678
They are supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot.

386
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,516
Oh.

387
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,134
Sorry, ma'am.

388
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:52,187
As it happens, Mr. Filch,
your arrival is most opportune.

389
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,654
If you would,
I would like you, please...

390
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:59,319
...to lead Miss Parkinson and the
rest of Slytherin House from the hall.

391
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,065
Exactly where is it I'll
be leading them to, ma'am?

392
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,830
The dungeons would do.

393
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,633
Right. Come on. Come on.

394
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:13,276
I presume you have a reason for returning,
Potter. What is it you need?

395
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,837
Time, professor. As much as you can get me.

396
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:20,008
Do what you have to do.
I'll secure the castle.

397
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:22,476
Potter.

398
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,185
It's good to see you.

399
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,456
It's good to see you too,
professor.

400
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,290
Hold the fort, Neville.

401
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,590
Hurry up, come on!

402
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,334
Harry. Hermione and l have been thinking.

403
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,444
It doesn't matter if
we find a Horcrux.

404
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,842
- What do you mean?
- Unless we can destroy it.

405
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:52,279
So we were thinking...

406
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:54,979
Ron was thinking.
It was Ron's idea. It's brilliant.

407
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,309
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a basilisk fang, right?

408
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,652
Me and Hermione know
where we might find one.

409
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,589
Okay.

410
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,491
Okay, but take this. That way you
can find me when you get back.

411
00:41:06,492 --> 00:41:08,898
- Where are you going?
- Ravenclaw common room.

412
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,423
Gotta start somewhere.

413
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,236
Harry.

414
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,933
Harry!

415
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,600
Let me get this straight.

416
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,738
- You're giving us permission to do this?
- That is correct, Longbottom.

417
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,349
To blow it up? Boom?

418
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,008
Boom!

419
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,587
Wicked. But how on earth
are we gonna do that?

420
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,088
Why don't you confer
with Mr. Finnigan?

421
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,820
As I recall, he has a particular
proclivity for pyrotechnics.

422
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,046
I can bring it down.

423
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,563
That's the spirit. Now away you go.

424
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:46,969
You do realize, of course, we can't
keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

425
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,133
Well, that doesn't mean we can't delay him.

426
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:55,302
And his name is Voldemort, Filius.
You might as well use it.

427
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,380
He's going to try to
kill you either way.

428
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,950
Piertotum Locomotor.

429
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,300
Hogwarts is threatened.

430
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:27,672
Man the boundaries. Protect us.
Do your duty to our school.

431
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:34,412
I've always wanted
to use that spell.

432
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,229
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

433
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:51,026
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

434
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:55,968
Protego Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

435
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,801
Protego Maxima.

436
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:30,406
- Harry, wait. I need to talk to you.
- I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.

437
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:33,376
You won't find anything where
you're going. You're wasting time.

438
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,545
- Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?
- Harry.

439
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:36,945
- Later.
- Harry Potter!

440
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,048
You listen to me right now!

441
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,981
Don't you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?

442
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:47,022
"There's not a person alive who's seen it."

443
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:51,890
It's obvious, isn't it?
We have to talk to someone who's dead.

444
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,070
It's very impressive, isn't it?

445
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:23,052
If you're to find her,
you'll find her down there.

446
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,660
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

447
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,319
I think it's best if
you two talk alone.

448
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:29,692
She's very shy.

449
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,750
You're the Grey Lady...

450
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:00,291
...the Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.

451
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,193
I do not answer to that name.

452
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,928
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw.

453
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:09,231
Rowena's daughter.

454
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,431
Are you a friend of Luna's?

455
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,542
Yes.

456
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,178
And she thought you might
be able to help me.

457
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:20,675
You seek my mother's diadem.

458
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:23,880
Yes.

459
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:25,846
That's right.

460
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:32,255
Luna is kind, unlike so many of the others.

461
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,489
But she was wrong.
I cannot help you.

462
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,571
Wait. Please.

463
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,299
I want to destroy it.

464
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,805
They never learn.

465
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,977
Such a pity.

466
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:33,586
But, my Lord...

467
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,021
...shouldn't we wait for...?

468
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,922
My Lord.

469
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,567
Begin.

470
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:07,520
That's what you want too, isn't it, Helena?

471
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,358
You want it destroyed.

472
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,557
Another swore to destroy
it many years ago...

473
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,601
...a strange boy
with a strange name.

474
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,604
- Tom Riddle.
- But he lied.

475
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:24,974
He's lied to many people.

476
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:28,236
I know what he's done!
I know who he is!

477
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,313
He defiled it with dark magic!

478
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,993
I can destroy it once and for all.

479
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:54,937
But only if you tell
me where he hid it.

480
00:47:56,907 --> 00:48:02,675
You do know where he hid it,
don't you, Helena?

481
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,682
You just have to tell me.

482
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,948
Please.

483
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,996
Strange.

484
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,964
You remind me of him a bit.

485
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:32,436
It's here...

486
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:37,376
...in the castle, in the place
where everything is hidden.

487
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,982
If you have to ask...

488
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,449
...you will never know.

489
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:48,390
If you know, you need only ask.

490
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,254
Thank you.

491
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:08,307
Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and l
will handle this side of the castle.

492
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,875
Yes, sir.

493
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,412
Hey, Dean, on second thoughts,
tell Professor McGonagall...

494
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,385
...we might need one or
two more wands this side.

495
00:49:20,386 --> 00:49:26,061
It is the quality of one's convictions
that determines success...

496
00:49:26,062 --> 00:49:27,825
...not the number of followers.

497
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:29,989
Who said that?

498
00:49:30,433 --> 00:49:31,991
Me.

499
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,674
You okay, Freddie?

500
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,475
Yeah.

501
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,640
Me too.

502
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:04,359
Harry talks in his sleep. Have you noticed?

503
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,260
No, of course not.

504
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,478
Yeah?

505
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,143
You and whose army?

506
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,002
- You do it.
- I can't.

507
00:51:20,176 --> 00:51:22,269
Yes, you can.

508
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:21,983
Neville!

509
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,075
That went well.

510
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:31,284
Get inside! This way, everyone. Take cover!

511
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,775
Stupefy!

512
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,639
Get your coat on!

513
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:56,910
Ginny. Neville. Are you all right?

514
00:55:57,086 --> 00:56:01,614
Never better. I feel like I could spit fire.
You haven't seen Luna, have you?

515
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,622
- Luna?
- I'm mad for her!

516
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:08,093
I think it's about time I told her since
we'll probably both be dead by dawn.

517
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,831
I know.

518
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,225
Bloody hell. We'll
never find it on this.

519
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,062
-There he is, just there.
- Brilliant.

520
00:56:47,236 --> 00:56:50,501
He just vanished.
Just now. I saw it.

521
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,776
Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement.

522
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:59,270
It doesn't show up on the map,
does it? You said that last year.

523
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,781
That's right. I... I did.

524
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,646
Let's go.

525
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,083
Brilliant.

526
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,355
Come on!

527
00:59:05,274 --> 00:59:06,605
Well, well.

528
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:09,636
What brings you here, Potter?

529
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,345
I could ask you the same.

530
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,008
You have something of mine.

531
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,409
I'd like it back.

532
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:20,122
-What's wrong with the one you have?
- It's my mother's.

533
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:23,991
It's powerful,
but it's not the same.

534
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,789
Doesn't quite understand me.

535
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:29,764
Know what I mean?

536
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,300
Why didn't you tell her?

537
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,164
Bellatrix.

538
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:40,508
You knew it was me.

539
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,768
You didn't say anything.

540
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:44,810
Come on, Draco.

541
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,144
Don't be a prat. Do him.

542
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:50,282
Easy.

543
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:52,984
Expelliarmus.

544
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:54,206
Avada Kedavra!

545
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:55,407
Stupefy!

546
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:02,888
That's my girlfriend, you numpties!

547
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,114
Got it.

548
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,260
Run!

549
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:36,692
Run!

550
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:43,603
Goyle's setting the
bloody place on fire!

551
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:52,506
Come on! This way!

552
01:01:59,815 --> 01:02:01,806
We can't leave them.

553
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,145
He's joking, right?

554
01:02:12,828 --> 01:02:15,661
If we die for them, Harry,
I'm gonna kill you.

555
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,015
Harry!

556
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,766
My Lord?

557
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,462
Avada Kedavra!

558
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:41,078
Come, Nagini.
I need to keep you safe.

559
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,293
It's the snake.

560
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:59,059
She's the last one.
It's the last Horcrux.

561
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,141
Look inside him, Harry.

562
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:12,076
Find out where he is.
If we find him, we can find the snake.

563
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:14,375
Then we can end this.

564
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:43,807
My Lord?

565
01:04:43,979 --> 01:04:47,847
Might it be less, uh...

566
01:04:48,617 --> 01:04:52,917
Might it not be more prudent
to call off this attack...

567
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,988
...and simply seek
the boy yourself?

568
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:59,491
I do not need to seek the boy.

569
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:04,065
Before the night is out,
he will come to me. Do you understand?

570
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:07,992
Look at me.

571
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:12,129
How can you live with
yourself, Lucius?

572
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:14,071
I don't know.

573
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,703
Go and find Severus.

574
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:21,374
Bring him to me.

575
01:05:29,391 --> 01:05:31,416
I know where he is.

576
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,196
Come on!

577
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,372
Crucio!

578
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,553
No!

579
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,951
You have performed extraordinary
magic with this wand, my Lord...

580
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:24,129
...in the last few hours alone.

581
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,069
No.

582
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,807
No, I am extraordinary...

583
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:33,608
...but the wand resists me.

584
01:07:33,782 --> 01:07:36,842
There is no wand more powerful.

585
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,817
Ollivander himself has said it.

586
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:45,621
Tonight, when the boy comes,
it will not fail you. I am sure of it.

587
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,496
It answers to you...

588
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,699
...and you only.

589
01:07:54,436 --> 01:07:55,926
Does it?

590
01:07:58,929 --> 01:08:00,453
My Lord?

591
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:07,100
The wand, does it
truly answer to me?

592
01:08:08,872 --> 01:08:10,965
You're a clever man, Severus.

593
01:08:11,141 --> 01:08:13,041
Surely you must know.

594
01:08:14,745 --> 01:08:18,442
Where does its true loyalty lie?

595
01:08:18,949 --> 01:08:20,712
With you...

596
01:08:21,218 --> 01:08:23,311
...of course, my Lord.

597
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:24,681
The Elder Wand...

598
01:08:25,489 --> 01:08:31,291
...cannot serve me properly
because I am not its true master.

599
01:08:32,396 --> 01:08:37,891
The Elder Wand belongs to the
wizard who killed its last owner.

600
01:08:43,807 --> 01:08:47,470
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

601
01:08:48,345 --> 01:08:53,612
While you live, the Elder
Wand cannot truly be mine.

602
01:08:55,085 --> 01:08:58,816
You've been a good and
faithful servant, Severus...

603
01:08:59,323 --> 01:09:04,386
...but only I can live forever.

604
01:09:07,698 --> 01:09:08,748
My Lord...

605
01:09:14,738 --> 01:09:16,831
Nagini, kill.

606
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:19,602
Take them.

607
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:22,705
Take them.

608
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,007
Please.

609
01:10:25,175 --> 01:10:28,872
Give me something. Quickly.
A flask, anything.

610
01:10:47,197 --> 01:10:48,664
Take them to the Pensieve.

611
01:10:52,236 --> 01:10:54,204
Look at me.

612
01:10:59,943 --> 01:11:02,673
You have your mother's eyes.

613
01:11:36,346 --> 01:11:39,907
You have fought valiantly...

614
01:11:41,318 --> 01:11:44,048
...but in vain.

615
01:11:47,357 --> 01:11:49,621
I do not wish this.

616
01:11:49,793 --> 01:11:55,322
Every drop of magical blood
spilled is a terrible waste.

617
01:11:55,499 --> 01:12:00,266
I therefore command
my forces to retreat.

618
01:12:00,437 --> 01:12:05,966
In their absence,
dispose of your dead with dignity.

619
01:12:06,476 --> 01:12:12,506
Harry Potter,
I now speak directly to you.

620
01:12:12,683 --> 01:12:18,053
On this night, you have allowed
your friends to die for you...

621
01:12:18,222 --> 01:12:20,713
...rather than face me yourself.

622
01:12:20,891 --> 01:12:24,452
There is no greater dishonor.

623
01:12:24,628 --> 01:12:29,588
Join me in the Forbidden
Forest and confront your fate.

624
01:12:30,834 --> 01:12:33,428
If you do not do this...

625
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:40,305
...I shall kill every last man,
woman and child...

626
01:12:40,477 --> 01:12:45,039
...who tries to
conceal you from me.

627
01:13:04,601 --> 01:13:06,535
Where is everybody?

628
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:32,378
Harry.

629
01:13:38,035 --> 01:13:40,799
Oh, come on. What's the matter with you?

630
01:13:40,971 --> 01:13:42,598
Oh, she's passed.

631
01:13:44,408 --> 01:13:46,899
There, she's gone.

632
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:56,689
Freak!

633
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,330
Come here.

634
01:15:58,508 --> 01:16:00,567
I'm gonna tell Mummy.
You're a freak.

635
01:16:00,744 --> 01:16:03,178
You're a freak, Lily!

636
01:16:03,346 --> 01:16:04,938
Come here.

637
01:16:25,936 --> 01:16:29,235
She's jealous because she's
ordinary and you're special.

638
01:16:29,406 --> 01:16:31,931
That's mean, Severus.

639
01:16:54,764 --> 01:16:56,823
Gryffindor!

640
01:17:04,374 --> 01:17:07,309
- Hi. I'm James.
- Hi. I'm Lily.

641
01:17:11,882 --> 01:17:16,012
Just like your father.
Lazy. Arrogant.

642
01:17:16,186 --> 01:17:18,017
Don't say a word against my father.

643
01:17:24,327 --> 01:17:25,919
Blood shall be spilt...

644
01:17:26,096 --> 01:17:31,090
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

645
01:17:31,268 --> 01:17:33,168
Severus.

646
01:17:34,237 --> 01:17:36,228
No. Don't kill me.

647
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:40,240
The prophecy did not
refer to a woman.

648
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,674
It spoke of a boy born
at the end of July.

649
01:17:42,846 --> 01:17:45,076
Yes, but he thinks it's her son.

650
01:17:45,682 --> 01:17:48,845
He intends to hunt them down now,
to kill them.

651
01:17:49,019 --> 01:17:53,513
Hide her. Hide them all. I beg you.

652
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:56,784
What will you give me in exchange, Severus?

653
01:17:58,528 --> 01:17:59,578
Anything.

654
01:17:59,729 --> 01:18:04,462
Harry. Harry,
you are so loved. So loved.

655
01:18:05,468 --> 01:18:08,130
Harry, Mama loves you.

656
01:18:08,305 --> 01:18:11,206
Dada loves you.

657
01:18:12,075 --> 01:18:14,236
Harry, be safe.

658
01:18:14,411 --> 01:18:15,461
Be strong.

659
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:17,102
Avada Kedavra!

660
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:26,078
You said you would keep her safe.

661
01:18:26,256 --> 01:18:30,283
Lily and James put their faith
in the wrong person, Severus.

662
01:18:31,261 --> 01:18:33,320
Rather like you.

663
01:18:35,465 --> 01:18:36,932
The boy survives.

664
01:18:36,933 --> 01:18:39,535
He doesn't need protection.
The Dark Lord is gone.

665
01:18:39,536 --> 01:18:41,766
The Dark Lord will return.

666
01:18:41,938 --> 01:18:45,499
And when he does, the boy
will be in terrible danger.

667
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:49,042
He has her eyes.

668
01:18:52,515 --> 01:18:55,678
If you truly loved her...

669
01:18:58,388 --> 01:19:02,222
No one can know.

670
01:19:02,392 --> 01:19:05,042
That I should never reveal
the best of you, Severus?

671
01:19:05,061 --> 01:19:06,111
Your word.

672
01:19:06,262 --> 01:19:09,163
When you risk your life every
day to protect the boy?

673
01:19:09,164 --> 01:19:13,068
He possesses no measurable talent,
his arrogance rivals that of his father...

674
01:19:13,069 --> 01:19:14,934
...and he seems to relish his fame.

675
01:19:15,105 --> 01:19:17,972
Don't say a word against my father.

676
01:19:18,141 --> 01:19:20,336
James Potter?

677
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,000
Lazy, arrogant.

678
01:19:22,178 --> 01:19:23,509
My father was a great man.

679
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,580
Your father was a swine!

680
01:19:27,417 --> 01:19:29,078
Drink the rest.

681
01:19:29,252 --> 01:19:33,279
It will contain the curse to
your hand for the time being.

682
01:19:33,456 --> 01:19:35,390
It will spread, Albus.

683
01:19:35,558 --> 01:19:37,253
How long?

684
01:19:38,228 --> 01:19:40,696
Maybe a year.

685
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:44,159
Don't ignore me, Severus.

686
01:19:44,234 --> 01:19:45,724
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

687
01:19:45,902 --> 01:19:49,861
We both know Lord Voldemort has
ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me.

688
01:19:51,941 --> 01:19:56,173
But should he fail,
one should presume the Dark Lord...

689
01:19:56,346 --> 01:19:58,473
...will turn to you.

690
01:20:01,217 --> 01:20:05,153
You must be the one
to kill me, Severus.

691
01:20:05,321 --> 01:20:07,482
It is the only way.

692
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:12,827
Only then will the Dark
Lord trust you completely.

693
01:20:12,996 --> 01:20:15,658
Avada Kedavra.

694
01:20:18,902 --> 01:20:23,839
There will come a time when Harry
Potter must be told something.

695
01:20:25,408 --> 01:20:30,607
But you must wait until Voldemort
is at his most vulnerable.

696
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:33,681
Must be told what?

697
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:35,875
On the night Lord Voldemort...

698
01:20:36,052 --> 01:20:39,249
...went to Godric's
Hollow to kill Harry...

699
01:20:40,256 --> 01:20:42,986
...and Lily Potter cast
herself between them...

700
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,694
... the curse rebounded.

701
01:20:47,497 --> 01:20:51,126
When that happened,
a part of Voldemort's soul...

702
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:56,136
... latched itself onto the
only living thing it could find:

703
01:20:56,306 --> 01:20:58,433
Harry himself.

704
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:03,212
There's a reason Harry
can speak with snakes.

705
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,613
There's a reason he can look
into Lord Voldemort's mind.

706
01:21:08,985 --> 01:21:15,049
A part of Voldemort
lives inside him.

707
01:21:21,498 --> 01:21:24,433
So when the time comes...

708
01:21:25,335 --> 01:21:27,496
...the boy must die?

709
01:21:29,405 --> 01:21:31,430
Yes. Yes.

710
01:21:31,608 --> 01:21:33,872
He must die.

711
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:57,031
You've kept him alive so that
he can die at the proper moment.

712
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:04,265
You've been raising him
like a pig for slaughter.

713
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:08,843
Don't tell me now that you've
grown to care for the boy?

714
01:22:13,349 --> 01:22:16,614
Expecto Patronum.

715
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:29,020
Lily.

716
01:22:32,302 --> 01:22:34,668
After all this time?

717
01:22:38,074 --> 01:22:40,201
Always.

718
01:22:45,348 --> 01:22:48,340
So when the time comes...

719
01:22:48,518 --> 01:22:51,510
...the boy must die?

720
01:22:51,688 --> 01:22:55,055
Yes. He must die.

721
01:22:55,225 --> 01:22:58,217
And Voldemort himself must do it.

722
01:22:58,661 --> 01:23:00,856
That is essential.

723
01:24:05,895 --> 01:24:06,953
Where've you been?

724
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:10,293
- We thought you went to the forest.
- I'm going there now.

725
01:24:10,466 --> 01:24:13,435
Are you mad? No.

726
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:16,661
You can't give yourself up to him.

727
01:24:20,009 --> 01:24:21,909
What is it, Harry?

728
01:24:23,446 --> 01:24:25,380
What is it you know?

729
01:24:28,151 --> 01:24:30,745
There's a reason I can hear them...

730
01:24:31,354 --> 01:24:32,582
...the Horcruxes.

731
01:24:35,091 --> 01:24:37,457
I think I've known for a while.

732
01:24:38,895 --> 01:24:41,159
And I think you have too.

733
01:24:44,133 --> 01:24:47,296
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

734
01:24:48,037 --> 01:24:50,164
Kill the snake and
then it's just him.

735
01:26:10,386 --> 01:26:12,411
I'm ready to die.

736
01:26:53,729 --> 01:26:56,163
The Resurrection Stone.

737
01:27:25,828 --> 01:27:29,229
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

738
01:27:33,302 --> 01:27:35,167
Why are you here?

739
01:27:35,972 --> 01:27:37,769
All of you?

740
01:27:40,143 --> 01:27:42,304
We never left.

741
01:27:51,187 --> 01:27:52,779
Does it...?

742
01:27:53,523 --> 01:27:54,717
Does it hurt?

743
01:27:55,758 --> 01:27:57,453
Dying?

744
01:27:58,394 --> 01:28:00,919
Quicker than falling asleep.

745
01:28:04,834 --> 01:28:07,132
You're nearly there, son.

746
01:28:07,303 --> 01:28:08,497
I'm sorry.

747
01:28:08,671 --> 01:28:12,163
I never wanted any
of you to die for me.

748
01:28:13,776 --> 01:28:15,368
And, Remus, your son...

749
01:28:15,545 --> 01:28:19,811
Others will tell him what his
mother and father died for.

750
01:28:19,982 --> 01:28:23,440
One day, he'll understand.

751
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:36,722
You'll stay with me?

752
01:28:38,301 --> 01:28:40,565
Until the end.

753
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:43,238
And he won't be able to see you?

754
01:28:43,406 --> 01:28:45,067
No.

755
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:48,969
We're here, you see.

756
01:29:03,526 --> 01:29:05,551
Stay close to me.

757
01:29:07,296 --> 01:29:09,457
Always.

758
01:29:24,213 --> 01:29:27,944
No sign of him, my Lord.

759
01:29:43,399 --> 01:29:46,163
I thought he would come.

760
01:30:27,009 --> 01:30:30,672
Harry? No! What are you doing here?

761
01:30:30,846 --> 01:30:32,143
Quiet!

762
01:30:43,159 --> 01:30:45,423
Harry Potter.

763
01:30:48,531 --> 01:30:51,227
The Boy Who Lived.

764
01:30:55,471 --> 01:30:57,905
Come to die.

765
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:17,820
Avada Kedavra!

766
01:32:14,517 --> 01:32:15,916
You can't help.

767
01:32:16,852 --> 01:32:17,902
Harry...

768
01:32:18,487 --> 01:32:20,751
...you wonderful boy.

769
01:32:21,257 --> 01:32:25,159
You brave, brave man.

770
01:32:27,129 --> 01:32:29,097
Let us walk.

771
01:32:36,572 --> 01:32:38,802
Professor, what is that?

772
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:44,536
Something beyond
either of our help.

773
01:32:47,416 --> 01:32:50,681
A part of Voldemort
sent here to die.

774
01:32:51,053 --> 01:32:52,313
And exactly where are we?

775
01:32:53,522 --> 01:32:57,481
I was going to ask you that.
Where would you say that we are?

776
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:59,389
Well...

777
01:32:59,562 --> 01:33:02,156
... it looks like
King's Cross station.

778
01:33:02,531 --> 01:33:04,829
Only cleaner.

779
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,230
And without all the trains.

780
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:10,500
King's Cross, is that right?

781
01:33:10,873 --> 01:33:14,434
This is, as they say, your party.

782
01:33:15,611 --> 01:33:18,603
I expect you now realize
that you and Voldemort...

783
01:33:18,781 --> 01:33:21,614
... have been connected by
something other than fate...

784
01:33:21,784 --> 01:33:24,810
...since that night in Godric's
Hollow all those years ago.

785
01:33:24,987 --> 01:33:26,716
So it's true then, sir?

786
01:33:26,889 --> 01:33:29,858
A part of him lives within me,
doesn't it?

787
01:33:30,192 --> 01:33:31,242
Did.

788
01:33:31,393 --> 01:33:36,194
It was just destroyed many moments ago
by none other than Voldemort himself.

789
01:33:37,266 --> 01:33:41,965
You were the Horcrux he
never meant to make, Harry.

790
01:33:54,517 --> 01:33:56,041
I have to go back, haven't l?

791
01:33:56,218 --> 01:33:58,118
Oh. That's up to you.

792
01:33:58,287 --> 01:34:00,050
I have a choice?

793
01:34:00,222 --> 01:34:02,019
Oh, yes.

794
01:34:02,191 --> 01:34:05,024
We're in King's Cross, you say?

795
01:34:06,128 --> 01:34:10,929
I think, if you so desired,
you'd be able to board a train.

796
01:34:12,334 --> 01:34:13,665
And where would it take me?

797
01:34:15,237 --> 01:34:17,068
On.

798
01:34:35,057 --> 01:34:37,150
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

799
01:34:39,795 --> 01:34:40,845
True.

800
01:34:40,996 --> 01:34:43,794
- And the snake's still alive.
- Yes.

801
01:34:43,966 --> 01:34:46,526
And I've nothing to kill it with.

802
01:34:47,069 --> 01:34:51,802
Help will always be given at Hogwarts,
Harry, to those who ask for it.

803
01:34:53,008 --> 01:34:56,705
I've always prized myself on
my ability to turn a phrase.

804
01:34:57,646 --> 01:35:00,774
Words are, in my not so humble opinion...

805
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:04,545
...our most inexhaustible source of magic...

806
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:09,054
...capable of both inflicting
injury and remedying it.

807
01:35:09,692 --> 01:35:15,597
But I would, in this case,
amend my original statement to this:

808
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:24,566
Help will always be given at
Hogwarts to those who deserve it.

809
01:35:30,412 --> 01:35:33,176
Do not pity the dead, Harry.

810
01:35:33,616 --> 01:35:35,641
Pity the living.

811
01:35:36,218 --> 01:35:41,087
And, above all, all those
who live without love.

812
01:35:42,057 --> 01:35:47,461
Professor, my mother's
Patronus was a doe, wasn't it?

813
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:51,124
That's the same as
Professor Snape's.

814
01:35:52,001 --> 01:35:54,094
It's curious, don't you think?

815
01:35:54,269 --> 01:35:59,229
Actually, if I think about it,
it doesn't seem curious at all.

816
01:36:00,943 --> 01:36:03,104
I'll be going now, Harry.

817
01:36:03,646 --> 01:36:04,977
Professor?

818
01:36:09,485 --> 01:36:11,646
Is this all real?

819
01:36:12,321 --> 01:36:14,311
Or is it just happening
inside my head?

820
01:36:14,323 --> 01:36:17,850
Of course it's happening
inside your head, Harry.

821
01:36:18,027 --> 01:36:21,793
Why should that mean
that it's not real?

822
01:36:27,369 --> 01:36:30,964
Professor? What should I do?

823
01:36:34,743 --> 01:36:36,506
Professor?

824
01:36:39,882 --> 01:36:41,179
My Lord?

825
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:43,477
My Lord, are you hurt? My Lord?

826
01:36:43,652 --> 01:36:45,279
I don't need your help.

827
01:36:45,454 --> 01:36:48,150
No. Come.

828
01:36:56,865 --> 01:36:58,696
The boy.

829
01:36:58,867 --> 01:37:00,801
Is he dead?

830
01:37:14,883 --> 01:37:17,078
Is he alive?

831
01:37:17,252 --> 01:37:19,447
Draco, is he alive?

832
01:37:46,115 --> 01:37:48,015
Dead.

833
01:39:14,803 --> 01:39:17,431
Who is that Hagrid's carrying?

834
01:39:18,106 --> 01:39:19,937
Neville, who is it?

835
01:39:20,609 --> 01:39:23,100
Harry Potter...

836
01:39:24,246 --> 01:39:25,736
...is dead.

837
01:39:25,914 --> 01:39:27,472
No! No!

838
01:39:27,649 --> 01:39:29,014
Silence.

839
01:39:32,821 --> 01:39:34,812
Stupid girl.

840
01:39:35,958 --> 01:39:39,394
Harry Potter is dead.

841
01:39:39,561 --> 01:39:44,692
From this day forth,
you put your faith...

842
01:39:44,867 --> 01:39:45,925
...in me.

843
01:39:56,411 --> 01:39:58,743
Harry Potter is dead!

844
01:40:03,585 --> 01:40:07,043
And now is the time
to declare yourself.

845
01:40:08,624 --> 01:40:11,354
Come forward and join us.

846
01:40:13,295 --> 01:40:14,990
Or die.

847
01:40:20,535 --> 01:40:21,585
Draco.

848
01:40:27,242 --> 01:40:29,107
Draco.

849
01:40:32,014 --> 01:40:33,914
Draco...

850
01:40:36,752 --> 01:40:38,652
...come.

851
01:40:49,631 --> 01:40:53,067
Ah. Well done, Draco.

852
01:40:53,869 --> 01:40:55,734
Well done.

853
01:41:18,293 --> 01:41:21,057
Well, I must say I'd
hoped for better.

854
01:41:25,467 --> 01:41:28,368
And who might you be, young man?

855
01:41:29,638 --> 01:41:31,572
Neville Longbottom.

856
01:41:36,878 --> 01:41:40,575
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our ranks.

857
01:41:40,749 --> 01:41:42,979
I'd like to say something.

858
01:41:49,124 --> 01:41:54,892
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
fascinated to hear what you have to say.

859
01:41:55,130 --> 01:42:00,568
- It doesn't matter Harry's gone.
- Stand down, Neville.

860
01:42:00,569 --> 01:42:03,163
People die every day.

861
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:08,901
Friends, family.

862
01:42:10,946 --> 01:42:12,504
Yeah.

863
01:42:13,949 --> 01:42:16,110
We lost Harry tonight.

864
01:42:17,652 --> 01:42:22,146
But he's still with us, in here.

865
01:42:23,158 --> 01:42:25,092
So's Fred...

866
01:42:26,094 --> 01:42:27,857
...and Remus.

867
01:42:28,964 --> 01:42:30,295
Tonks.

868
01:42:31,633 --> 01:42:33,533
All of them.

869
01:42:34,703 --> 01:42:36,967
They didn't die in vain.

870
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:43,168
But you will.

871
01:42:43,345 --> 01:42:45,711
- Because you're wrong.
- Ha-ha-ha.

872
01:42:45,881 --> 01:42:48,873
Harry's heart did beat for us.
For all of us.

873
01:42:49,051 --> 01:42:50,643
This is not over!

874
01:42:54,756 --> 01:42:56,587
Confringo!

875
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,458
No! No, come back!

876
01:43:06,635 --> 01:43:10,571
Lucius! Come back!
Come back and fight!

877
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:12,798
Come back!

878
01:43:17,846 --> 01:43:21,009
I'll lure him into the castle.
We have to kill the snake.

879
01:43:21,183 --> 01:43:23,083
- You'll need this.
- Neville!

880
01:46:16,625 --> 01:46:19,150
Not my daughter, you bitch.

881
01:46:52,627 --> 01:46:53,958
You were right...

882
01:46:55,730 --> 01:46:58,062
...when you told Snape
that wand was failing you.

883
01:46:58,233 --> 01:46:59,894
It will always fail you.

884
01:47:01,202 --> 01:47:02,760
I killed Snape.

885
01:47:02,937 --> 01:47:05,227
But what if the wand
never belonged to Snape?

886
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:08,107
What if its allegiance was
always to someone else?

887
01:47:08,276 --> 01:47:11,473
Come on, Tom. Let's finish
this the way we started it.

888
01:47:11,946 --> 01:47:12,996
Together.

889
01:50:44,993 --> 01:50:49,630
- Ha, ha.
- I always figured he would be a big fellow.

890
01:50:49,631 --> 01:50:53,965
I couldn't find my wand.
I haven't lost my wand in my entire life.

891
01:50:54,135 --> 01:50:56,126
It was lost in the
folds of my gowns.

892
01:50:56,304 --> 01:50:59,102
I managed to find it and I
dispatched a few of them...

893
01:50:59,274 --> 01:51:00,502
Harry.

894
01:52:00,969 --> 01:52:04,666
Why didn't it work for him, the Elder Wand?

895
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:07,574
It answered to somebody else.

896
01:52:07,575 --> 01:52:11,478
When he killed Snape,
he thought the wand would become his.

897
01:52:11,479 --> 01:52:15,643
But the thing is,
the wand never belonged to Snape.

898
01:52:15,817 --> 01:52:20,311
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the astronomy tower.

899
01:52:20,488 --> 01:52:24,515
From that moment on,
the wand answered to him.

900
01:52:25,393 --> 01:52:27,224
Until...

901
01:52:27,395 --> 01:52:31,957
...the other night when I
disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.

902
01:52:32,133 --> 01:52:34,260
So that means...

903
01:52:35,803 --> 01:52:37,566
It's mine.

904
01:52:39,707 --> 01:52:40,969
What should we do with it?

905
01:52:41,409 --> 01:52:43,172
We?

906
01:52:43,578 --> 01:52:47,810
I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand,
the most powerful wand in the world.

907
01:52:47,982 --> 01:52:51,918
With that, we'd be invincible.

908
01:55:15,062 --> 01:55:16,723
Together.

909
01:55:34,048 --> 01:55:36,209
Look after each other.

910
01:55:55,403 --> 01:55:57,166
- Bag?
- Yeah.

911
01:55:57,338 --> 01:55:58,396
Jumper?

912
01:56:00,074 --> 01:56:02,065
I'll miss you.

913
01:56:03,177 --> 01:56:04,906
Here they come.

914
01:56:20,094 --> 01:56:24,292
Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?

915
01:56:26,567 --> 01:56:29,127
Albus Severus Potter...

916
01:56:30,404 --> 01:56:34,135
...you were named after two
headmasters of Hogwarts.

917
01:56:34,308 --> 01:56:35,900
One of them was a Slytherin...

918
01:56:36,077 --> 01:56:39,308
...and he was the bravest
man I've ever known.

919
01:56:41,182 --> 01:56:42,444
But just say that I am.

920
01:56:42,617 --> 01:56:48,214
Then Slytherin House will have
gained a wonderful young wizard.

921
01:56:48,389 --> 01:56:54,089
But, listen, if it really means that
much to you, you can choose Gryffindor.

922
01:56:54,262 --> 01:56:57,197
The Sorting Hat takes
your choice into account.

923
01:56:57,798 --> 01:56:59,823
- Really?
- Really.

924
01:57:01,202 --> 01:57:03,864
- Bye, Mum.
- All aboard.

925
01:57:04,038 --> 01:57:05,088
Ready?

926
01:57:05,239 --> 01:57:06,797
Ready.

927
01:57:19,053 --> 01:57:20,680
Come on, Jay, get a move on.

928
01:57:20,855 --> 01:57:22,322
Come on.
