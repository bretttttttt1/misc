Dragon Ball Z Kai 

Kakarrot?
Yeah, a lower-class warrior child, right?
Nothing to do but send him off to some frontier planet, huh?
I suppose not.

On Planet Vegeta, a baby boy cries for the first time. His father, and his mother planet, are about to be destroyed by a fearsome enemy.

Freeza!
--It's Freeza-sama!
--Freeza-sama!

Everything changes now.

The fate of Planet Vegeta, of Kakarrot......as well as......your fate!
This is the end!
W-What?!
Ka... kar... rot...
Kakarrot!!
My son, Kakarrot...
Carry on my dying wish!
You must avenge the fall of the Saiyans, and of Planet Vegeta!

And so, a baby from a faraway planet falls to Earth.
He was a young boy who had taken the charge of an unknown destiny.

Let's name you... Goku!

This is the tale of Son Goku.
Son Goku would grow up healthy, and together with Bulma, go on a journey to gather the seven Dragon Balls, which were said to grant any wish.

While on this journey, Goku would meet many friends, go through much training, seek for greater strength, and fight. In his battle against the Demon Clan, who sought to rule the world, he would increase his power even further under the guidance of the martial arts sage Karin-sama, and masterfully put a stop to the schemes of Piccolo Daimao, who had once again become young with the Dragon Balls.
Piccolo would leave behind his offspring before dying. Three years later, Ma Junior, the reincarnation of Piccolo, and a grown-up Goku would wage battle in a fateful confrontation.
Following a heated battle, Goku would claim the victory.
It's now a little more than five years later.
Goku and Chichi had abruptly gotten married, and the people were living in peace.
However...

"Prologue to Battle! The Return of Son Goku."

Gohan-chan!
Lunchtime!
Gohan-chan!

This is a good one.

Gohan-chan!

Ah, welcome home.

Goku-sa, where's Gohan?

I'm starving!

What are you talkin' about?
Have you seen Gohan-chan?

Huh? No, I ain't seen him.

You have to hurry and eat before you leave, or you're goin' to keep Muten Roshi-sama and the others waitin'.

All right, I'll go look for him.
I don't think he's gone too far away.
Yeah. I'll take care of it!
I'm countin' on you!

You sure are pretty.

My name is Son Gohan.

Ah! Wait!

Mother! Father!

Gohan!

F-Father!

Sit tight! I'm coming to help right now!

Gohan!

A little farther...

--Father!
--Gohan!

Father!

Gohan!

Father! I can't get down!

I'm scared! I'm scared! Father!

Father, I was so scared!
I was so scared, Father!

Gohan......how did you get up here?

I-I don't know.

Gohan, let's go home.
Mommy is worried about you.
We have to be going to Old Timer Turtle Hermit's place soon, too.

Mm-hmm.

Whoo, just about there...

W-W-What was that just now?!
A meteor?! A UFO?!
T-That's no meteor. What the heck is it?
W-Who are you...?

A battle power of just 5? What trash.

D-Don't you come near me! I-I'll shoot!

Hmph. What a frail race this is.
There's someone with a large power here. Range 4,880.
Is that you, Kakarrot?!

W-What power is this?! it couldn't be...Son Goku?!
No, it isn't!

You're not Kakarrot.

Who are you? Do you have some business with me?

I have no business with you.

Then what did you come here for? Do you want to die?

You're mighty spirited, huh? Hmm, battle power 322. So there's someone like you around, is there?

Still......you are no match for me.

What was that?! Do you know who you're saying that to?!

Not really.

What's with this guy's power...?

Such a worthless technique.
Is kicking up dust all it does?
Is it my turn now? Well then, let me show you a sampling of my moves.
There's another large power.
That way. Range 12,909. it's big.
The biggest power on the planet.
This time for sure, it's Kakarrot!

I-Impossible...
I-I was shaking so hard, I couldn't move...

Good afternoon!
Long time no see!

Bulma-san!

You said come pay a visit, so here I am.

Well, well, it really has been a long time.
This house is the same as it always has been, huh?

You are so cold.
Unless someone tells you to come visit, you stay away.

Here.
Some manju buns, as a gift.

You didn't have to go to all that trouble. If you'd just let me touch your boobs a little bit...
You don't appreciate my gags, same as ever.

You're the same lecherous jerk as ever!

By the way, Bulma-san, where is Yamucha-san?

Yamucha? That idiot? How should I know about him?
I am so fed up with him, I didn't tell him we were all getting together today.
Let's have a blast without him!

You sure do fight a lot, huh?

They sure do.

Incidentally, where is Lunch-san?

She went off somewhere, chasing Tenshinhan-san, five years ago.

The location of this power is moving at considerable speed.

See? That's Muten Roshi-sama's house.
Yoo-hoo!

I-Is that...?

--Son-kun!
--Goku!

--Yo!
--Huh? What's with the boy?

Have you started working as a babysitter or something?

He's my boy.

Y-Yours, Goku?!

Yeah, that's right. Is that strange?

Go on, say hello.

Good afternoon.

--R-Right.
--Good afternoon.

His name is Son Gohan.

Son Gohan? I see, so you've given him the name of your late grandpa?

Yeah.

I have to say, I'm amazed. To think that you'd be bringing a child along, Goku...

Gohan-kun, how old are you?

I'm four years old.

Wow, he has good manners, considering he's your son, Son-kun.

Chichi is really fussy about that.

Say, Gohan-kun, what do you want to be when you grow up?

A great scholar.

S-Scholar?

A tail...?

Yeah.

Just like I used to have, right?

Y-You're right.

S-Say, does anything particularly strange happen to your boy?

Strange?

F-For example, does he change at all on nights with a full moon?

Nights with a full moon? I don't know. We go to bed early at my house.

--How come?
--N-Never mind, it's nothing.

If that's the case, then all right.

S-Say, Goku, is he strong, like you are?

About that...I think he's got quite a bit of power, but when I try to train Gohan, Chichi gets mad.

Rock, paper, scissors!

What for? That's such a waste, isn't it?

Ain't it?

She says the world is at peace now, so we don't need martial arts no more. She says from now on, it's the age of studying.

So that tomboy of a girl turned out to be an education-minded mom?

Father!

Say, is that a Dragon Ball stuck to Gohan-kun's hat?

Yeah, that's Si Xing Qiu. It is a keepsake from my grandpa, after all. I searched for it, and stuck it on there. I found San Xing Qiu and Liu Xing Qiu while I was at it. They're back at home.

That sure takes me back. The Dragon Balls, huh?

--What's that?!
--What's wrong?

S-Something's coming this way.

Something's coming?

It's awesome! I sense an awesome power! What is it?!

It's here!

Here it comes!

W-What is that?

Who is it?!

What a brutal bloodlust!

So, we finally meet. You've grown up. But I knew it was you at first glance, Kakarrot.

Kakarrot?

You look just like our father.

What does he mean?

W-What is this? What's he talking about?

Kakarrot, what is with the condition of this planet? Your mission was supposed to be to exterminate all of humanity. What the hell have you been goofing around for?!

Hey, now, hold on, you. I don't know who you are, but go away, go away. Shoo, shoo!
Man, it just isn't right to be drunk this early in the afternoon. --Okay then, go on, go on.

--Kuririn! Keep away from him!
Kuririn! Why, you...!

What's this? A man with a tail has appeared.


"The Enemy is Goku's Brother?! The Secret of the Mighty Saiyan Warriors."

A-A tail! This guy has a tail, too!

It looks like you've finally realized who I am.

Who you are?

--What do you mean?!
--Here, come over here with us.

Kakarrot...

...have you even forgotten about that?

My name ain't that
funny-sounding Kaka-whatever!

I am Son Goku!

How can this be?

You stay over there!

Hey!

Have you ever taken any strong
shocks to the head in the past?

What?

Did you hit your head hard,
say, when you were a child?

Answer my question!

I did!

I don't remember it, but I hit
my head when I was really little.

Just as I suspected.

Even so, what does it
have to do with anything?!

Goku!

A long time ago, your grandfather,
Son Gohan, said something to me.

One day, in a deep valley,

he discovered a strange object
that looked like it had fallen there.

When he got closer, he saw a baby
with a tail, inside a round capsule.

He decided to take him home and raise him,

but he had a violent disposition,
and wouldn't take to him.

He said he was at a complete
loss as to what to do with him.

But one day, he accidentally fell into a ravine,

hit his head hard, and nearly died,

but he said the baby had
an unbelievable life force,

and he ended up surviving.

What's more, he said that after that,

his violent nature disappeared,
and he became a good boy.

A-And that was me?

--Mm-hmm.
--W-What does that mean?

Are Son-kun and that guy somehow connected?

Just who the hell are you?!

Tell me who you are!

I will tell you.

You are not from this planet.

You were born on Planet Vegeta!

You are a Saiyan,

a proud member of the strongest
warriors in the universe!

--The universe?!
--Warriors?!

Saiyan?!

And I am your older brother, Raditz!

G-Goku's older brother?!

You're brothers?! No way!

Don't give me that malarkey!

Y-Yeah! if Goku is an alien,
what's he doing on Earth?!

The answer is simple. Kakarrot,
you were sent here to exterminate

the humans who are cluttering up this planet.

W-What did you say?!

We Saiyans are a highly renowned warrior race.

Our job is to travel around the universe,

looking for planets that
have good environments,

exterminating the people
already living on them,

and then selling them to aliens
seeking a suitable planet

for a high price.

Adult warriors are sent to the worlds

of those who have a high battle power,

but for lower-level planets,
like this one, babies like you are sent.

Kakarrot...

Even by yourself, a few years
should have been plenty of time

for you to have liquidated these pests.

If you had only remembered
your mission, that is.

Luckily, this world has a moon, as well.

Hey, why is it lucky that there's a moon here?

Don't play dumb!
It's when the moon becomes full

that we Saiyans really start
hitting our stride, you know!

What are you talking about?!
I have no idea what you mean!

What?

Y-You don't mean...

Your tail!

What happened to your tail?!

It got cut off and disappeared a long time ago!

H-How can that be?! You miserable fool!

It's no wonder you get along so
well with the people of this world!

Enough!

Whether I'm from another planet,
named whatever,

or you're really my brother, it doesn't matter!

Anyone who would
exterminate all humans is the pits!

I am Son Goku, and I was raised here!
Get out of here, right now!

Yeah, yeah!

You heard him! Whatever his past was,

right now, Son Goku is a
better earthling than anyone!

Goku has even saved the world! Beat it! Beat it!

I'm afraid I can't do that, you see.

The Saiyans weren't a race
of many people to begin with,

but now Planet Vegeta has exploded,

after a giant meteor collided with it.

Most of the other Saiyans
were vaporized into space dust.

Including our father and mother.

There are now only four
Saiyans left, including you.

Myself and one of the others survived

because we were off attacking another planet.

The other one got lucky because he
was sent to a planet, like you were.

Just recently, we found a nice planet

that we should be able
to sell for a very high price.

We'd like to attack it,

but it would be a bit of an uphill
battle with just the three of us.

That's when I remembered about you, Kakarrot.

Your battle power is still less than perfect,

but if you joined the three of us,
we would be able to manage.

--Stay back!
--Open your eyes, Kakarrot!

It will be fun!

I-I'm scared!

Don't be ridiculous!

I'd rather die than help you!

I see.

I've been wondering about something.

That's your son behind you, isn't it?

N-No!

It's no use trying to pretend.

What about the tail?

That proves he has Saiyan blood, doesn't it?

So what if he does?!

Since you, the father,
aren't being very reasonable,

what if I were to borrow
the son for a little while?

Keep back!

Just try to come any closer!

I'll send you flying!

Father!

--Father!
--Whoa, there!

Kakarrot, I have your child.

If you want him back alive,
you'll follow your brother's orders!

D-D-Damn it...!

Kakarrot, I'm giving you
one day, so think about it.

You don't have any choice
but to go along with us.

However, you're going to
have to show me some proof.

Oh, but it will be easy. By this time tomorrow,

you will kill, let's say, a hundred
people from this planet,

and pile up their bodies here!

You heard me. I'll be looking
forward to tomorrow.

He's my own brother's son.

If at all possible,
I'd like to avoid killing him.

I'm scared, Father!

G-Gohan!

Listen up. I'm going to say
this again, just to be sure.

You will kill one hundred
people from this planet

and pile their bodies up here, by tomorrow.

Do that, and we'll let you join us.

Of course, if there are no bodies,
it will mean the death of your son.

Y-You coward! Using a child like that!

Y-Yeah!

Right!

For one thing, there's no way
Goku could kill anyone!

That's fine.

As long as he doesn't mind if this one dies,

there's no need for him to get
those hundred bodies ready.

But...

...either way, the people of this planet

are destined to be wiped out before long.

Once we subjugate this upcoming planet,

we've decided that our
next target will be this world!

W-What?!

The three of us Saiyans
should be able to exterminate

the people of this planet in just one month.

Father!

You got that, Kakarrot?

No matter how you struggle,

you have no choice but to
join your brother and his pals.

G-Give me back the child!

I'll be expecting a positive answer from you.

For your sake, as well.

Don't think you can go against me.

With your work-in-progress battle power,

there's no way you're a
match for your older brother!

Father!

Bye, now! I look forward to tomorrow!

Gohan!

Father!

Gohan!

Are you okay, Son-kun?

S-Sorry, there was nothing
we could have done.

Goku...

Kinto Un!

Hold on! That's crazy! Don't be hasty!

Y-You can't! You'll be killed!

Damn! What should I do?!

Think.

Steady, now.

It's shocking, huh?

You unexpectedly discover you have a relative,

and it's that guy, of all people.

Your brother's strength is monstrous, and all.

His tail.

If I...

if I grab his tail hard,
his strength should slacken.

I was the same way.

B-But still, will you even
be able to grab his tail?

You can't do it yourselves!

Piccolo!

You must know well enough that
his strength is out of your league.

He isn't the sort of opponent that
you or I could take on directly.

However...

...if you and I team up,

there is a slight chance
that we could defeat him.

What on earth has gotten into you?

Don't get me wrong.

It's not like I've had my eyes
opened to peace, or anything.

I don't care about your son, either.

He just stands in the way of my
goal of world domination, that's all!

I'll team up with you,

and once we've dealt with him
and those two buddies of his...

...then of course, I plan to defeat you,

and make the world mine this time for sure!

I won't let you do that.

I won't let you do that,

but the part about the two of us
teaming up is a good idea.

It looks like there ain't any
other way to do it, huh?

That's right. We'll just have to put up with it.

As far as I'm concerned, teaming up
with you makes me want to vomit.

Bulma, let me borrow your Dragon Radar!

R-Right!

Can you keep up with Kinto Un's speed?!

Don't be absurd!

My own technique is a little different

than your pathetic Bukujutsu technique.

Let me out!

Let me out! Let me out!

Now then...

That's strange. A warning signal.

Battle power 710? it's close!

What?!

Damn, it's malfunctioning, huh?

Don't startle me like that.

We should descend now, and move in on him.

It won't work! We should keep going like this!

He uses a device.

It seems to be able to clearly
tell him his target's position,

and even their strength.

You mean, the fact that
we're closing in on him, too...?

I'm sure he's aware of it.

You don't say. That means that all
we can do is attack him head-on!

Again?

Battle power 710. Tch,
it's a malfunction, all right.

Two readings?

They're headed this way!

One... two...

Battle power 322 and 334.

One of them is the same
power that Kakarrot has!

But there's no way he'd be coming.

He has to know that there's
next to zero chance of him winning.

And he wouldn't know
where I am in the first place.

I give up. This thing is completely busted.

It can't be!

They're here!

How did you know where I was?

As if I'd tell you!

Very well, I'll ask you a different question.

What are you two doing here?

Isn't that obvious?
We came to get my boy back!

Which means that even though you're a Saiyan,

you're refusing to join us, is that it?

That's what I told you!

You intend to defy your brother?

I ain't got any brothers!

Kakarrot...

I thought you were a bit sharper than this.

That's enough yammering out of you.

His battle power just went up to 408.

Is that right? You've been
training like crazy, too?

This should make the fight go a little better.

Kakarrot is now 416!

You guys think you're stronger now?!

What?!

You make me laugh!

To think that you would just
waltz on in here at that level!

This is what it means to not know your place!

Winning a fight ain't just
about who's the strongest!

We've got ourselves a strategy!

You think you're clever, do you?

Kakarrot, I've decided to
give up on letting you join us.

After all, it looks like
you'd just slow us down.

You're a disgrace to the family! Die!

I think I'll let you in on a little
something before you die.

The two other remaining Saiyans

have an even higher battle power than I do!


A Life-or-Death Battle! Goku and Piccolo's Ferocious suicide Attack"

Goku was powerless against the
might of his Saiyan brother, Raditz.

--Father!
--Whoa, there!

Kakarrot, I have your child.

If you want him back alive,
you'll follow your brother's orders!

Will he be able to get Gohan back?


if you're just finding out
how fearsome a Saiyan is,

it's already too late.

For those who still defy me

after I've gone to the trouble of
warning them, there is only death!

He's got us.

To think that there are even
stronger guys than him out there.

It's exciting, isn't it, Son Goku?

Sorry, but this time, I ain't feeling excited.

I'm so scared, I'm shaking.

It's only natural. But that terror
will soon be turning to despair.

Never mind me, where is my son?!
Where did you hide him?!

I haven't hidden him. He was just
wailing so loud, I locked him up.

You see that hole behind you? He's in there.

Over there?

Gohan...

Father! Help me! Father!

Just sit tight, Gohan! Daddy will
help you out of there right away!

Don't be ridiculous!

There's no way you can help him!

Not when you guys are going to die first!

All right, let's do it!

We don't have any other choice!

Behind me!

Yikes!

W-Where did you go?!

Right here.

D-Damn! A-Are you all right, Piccolo?!

R-Relax. I can still manage
to fight with one arm.

It looks like your deaths are drawing near!

Hey, Son Goku, do you have
any new moves up your sleeve?

Sorry, but to be honest, I ain't got any.

You've been slacking.

And here, I've been training earnestly,
developing a new move.

What are you whispering about?

Whatever strategy you
come up with, it won't work!

It'd be easier on you if
you just croaked right away.

Can you do it with only one arm?

Yeah, that part's all right.

But it takes quite a bit of time
to build up the Ki for this move.

While I do, you fight him by yourself,

and keep his attention drawn.

You got it.

I had been saving this to kill you with.

And now, you might just
end up saving me with it, huh?

If I'm able to kill him with it,
your turn will come next.

All right, I can't wait to see it!

Now, let's see if I can keep him bottled up!

You sure are persistent!

Ka......me...

His battle power is going up!

...ha......me...

A-And his battle power is 1,080!
Unbelievable! it's still going up!

...Ha!!

You've got some nerve!

H-He caught it!

I have a present for you, now!

Die!

Battle power 1,322 ...!

H-He's concentrated all of his battle power

into his fingertips!

D-Damn! These guys are able to
manipulate their power at will!

Take this on! Makankosappo!!

H-He dodged it!

To think that you'd injure me...

You'll pay for that!

See you in Hell!

You dropped your guard, huh?

Now I've got your tail!

W-When did you manage to...

Piccolo! Now! Do that thing again!

You've outdone yourself, Goku!
Hold onto that tail tightly!

I can only use this technique one more time!

K-Kakarrot, y-you would kill your only brother?

Shut up! I told you, anyone as
cruel as you are ain't my brother!

Don't you talk about yourself like that,

not after you were about to kill me!

I-I'll stop! I've had a change of heart!

I'll leave this planet without any more trouble!

Don't fall for it, Son Goku!

He doesn't mean what he's saying!

There's no way he's going to do that!

P-Please, believe me, my brother!

Sure, I've done a lot of
terrible things up to now,

I-including to you. But I will
keep my promise to you!

Y-You mean it?

I-I mean it!

N-No! Don't let go of his tail! That's his ploy!

Please, Kakarrot! Believe me!

Son Goku!

You hapless fool! it's rare to
find anyone as dumb as you!

T-That was dirty!

But I'm not like you.
I am a first-class warrior!

I won't hesitate for a moment to kill you,

even if you are my brother!

You want me to show you
what I'm talking about? Hmm?

Suffer some more! Your death is near!

What's the matter?
Do that thing you did earlier!

H-He'll just avoid it again like this!

What?!

W... What's this?!

Impossible...

G-Gohan...?

R-Run away, Gohan...

Run away!

B-Battle power... 1,307 ?!

Stop picking on...

...my father!!

Ow!

G-Gohan...

Father!

D-Did you...?

F-Father...

Y-You little brat!

R-Run away!

Gohan, run away!

Run away! Hurry!

N-Now his battle power is just 1?

I-It changes completely,
together with his feelings.

Run away!

Gohan!

S-Stop! Don't do it! He's just...

Just a child, is that what you're telling me?

You've got to be kidding.

That kid has a battle power
far higher than you two.

I'll kill him now, before he becomes
able to better use his power.

Don't worry, though.
I'll reunite you soon enough.

In the next world, that is.

Wait!

You're the first one to ever
do this much damage to me.

But this is where it ends!

Die!

W-Why, you!

Piccolo!

Quick! That technique from before!

I've been getting it ready,
thinking this might be coming!

But I'll need... a little more time!

Piccolo! Hurry!

Make it quick!

Let me go, Kakarrot! You idiot!

With us stuck together, you won't
come out unharmed, either!

Then I'll die right along with you.

W-What did you say?!

A-Are you out of your mind?!

There ain't any other way to defeat you!

Son Goku...

I'm not going to hold back!

Nothing would be better than
having you out of the picture, too!

L-Let me go! I-I was wrong!

I won't ever come to this planet again!

Y-You're not going to trick me again!

It's no lie! D-Don't you trust
your own brother's word?!

Piccolo! Hurry it up!

Sorry to keep you waiting. Are you ready?

Do it!

Take this!

Wait!

Makankosappo!!

D-Damn it all!

D-Damn! To think that I would be...
d-done in... by these guys...

I-imagine, Kakarrot...

...g-giving up his... own life...

Son Goku can be brought
back to life in no time.

What?!

On this planet, we have some
nice things we call Dragon Balls.

By making a request to them,
any wish you desire is possible.

Even bringing the dead back to life.

D-Damn...

Still, I'm glad you told me that.

This entire situation up to now

has been transmitted to my two
companions, far away in outer space.

--What?
--W-When they learn I've been beaten, they...

...they're sure to be coming here...

They'll sweep not just you,

but everyone on this planet,

away in the... blink of an eye...

T-Those... two guys...

W-When will they... get here...?

One year... Just one year...

In one year, two more of you,
who are even stronger...

it was a short-lived celebration, huh...?

You guys are no more than worms after all...

You can rest in peace now.

You had to go and open your big mouth.

Son Goku, he's dead.

Ah! There are a few of them down!

W-Who's that still standing?

It's Piccolo!

Raditz is dead.

Seriously, how pathetic.

To think that he was killed

by guys whose battle power
was just over a thousand.

What do we do? Put this planet
on hold, and go there?

They did say something... interesting, huh?

About "Dragon Balls" or whatever.

Yeah. Supposedly, they grant any wish.

All right, let's go.

We're going to bring Raditz back to life, right?

You must be joking. We don't
need that useless guy anymore.

How does this sound?

We never grow any older, and gain eternal life?

By doing that, we'll be able
to enjoy fighting forever.

I get you. That would be great!

And that's how it happened.

I-I see.

Goku! Goku, I say!

Hey, Goku! Stay with me!

Gohan-kun is all right. He's just unconscious.

Thank... goodness...

--He's coming to!
--Goku!

...I won't have to have Chichi yell at me.

Son-kun...

K-Kuririn...

Dying is... pretty... n-nasty, huh?

W-What are you talking about,
Goku?! Get hold of yourself!

This isn't like you!

L-Looks like this time, at least, I'm done for.

D-Don't worry! We'll bring
you back to life right away!

P-Please do...

Goku...

Goku!!


Run in the Afterlife, Son Goku! The Million Kilometer Serpent Road!" 
  
I'll bet that right now,  Goku-san and the others are having a fun time at the Kame House. 

I wonder if Gohan's fittin' in with them okay. 

Then again, he'll be fine. 

He's a well-behaved boy. 

I wish I've gone. 

Gohan-chan! 

Pa! 

Chichi, where's Gohan-chan? 

Hey, Gohan-chan! I brought you a whole heap of presents! 

Pa! 

Goku! Goku!! Goku! 
--Goku... --Hey, Goku! Son-kun, don't die! Goku! Goku! 

He disappeared! 

I get it. 
This is Kami's doing. 

He's about the only one who could do something like this. 

The bastard has another one of his worthless ideas. 

I wonder what he intends to do. 

Hmm... T-Then again, if it's Kami-sama, I suppose we can relax. 

Whatever the case, we have to gather the other six Dragon Balls and bring Goku back to life right away. 

Man! 

At a critical time like this, where could Yamucha and the others have gone off to?! 

You're the one who drove him off, aren't you? 

You know, I wonder how Son-kun's brother knew where he was so easily. 

It's that strange device he is wearing on his face. 
Apparently, it can tell an opponent's strength and location. 

--Kuririn... --R-Right! Right, right, right... That's it, there. 
Kuririn, grab it for me, okay? 

Eh? Uh, o-okay. 
He's not going to come back to life or anything, right?

Let's see, this goes like that...

This gizmo is amazing.

It's a little damaged, but I think I can do something with it.

You're incredible, Bulma-san.

Once I take this back, study it, and refurbish it, we might be able to locate Yamucha, Tenshinhan and the others.

Well, in any case, let's get back to the Kame House.

Right. There's nothing more we can do here, huh?

Okay then, afterward, I'll start looking for the Dragon Balls, right away.

Piccolo, what do you intend to do--

Just like a lizard's tail...

You guys look for the Dragon Balls.

Kami doesn't have the power to bring people back to life himself.

But I will be taking charge of Son Goku's son there.

W-What are you going to do?

That Gohan kid could become a powerful force, depending on how he is trained.

If we're going to prevail against the two Saiyans

who will be coming in one year, we're going to need his strength.

In order for that to happen, I'm going to have to train him.

You can't be serious.

I'm not sure that's going to go over well...

Mm-hmm, we'll have to ask Goku, and the boy's mother, Chichi, first.

We can't afford the time!

Don't give me any trouble, or I'll kill you, and then take him!

Once a year is up, I'll come to your house, together with the kid.

Once you bring Son Goku back to life, tell him he can look forward to seeing him then.

I don't know... I don't know about this...

He's gonna die! if he's lucky, he'll just turn out delinquent!

With that in mind, he has arrived here in flesh-and-blood form, wishing to be allowed to train.

Please, Great King Yama, I humbly ask that you permit this man to call upon Kaio-sama.

Son Goku, huh? indeed, your marks are outstanding.

You're saying that even though he could go to Heaven, he wants to risk the danger of traversing the Serpentine Road to see Kaio-sama, is that it?

Yes, sir.

Hey, does everyone come here once they die?

--That's right.
--Even aliens?

Mm-hmm. Everyone who is dead comes here to be judged, to see if they go to Heaven or Hell.
Hey, just a little before I got here, did a guy named Raditz pop in here?
Watch it! You have to say "come through here."
Yeah, he came through here, all right. He was your brother, right? He was sent to Hell, naturally.

He didn't make any trouble?

Oh, he made trouble. He made trouble, but I overpowered him.

You're pretty strong, ain't you, taking someone as awesome as he was?

Maybe I should have pops here train me!

Shh! You're being too loud!

You shouldn't be using language like that about Great King Yama!

But...

Keep quiet! Kaio-sama is even stronger!

I heard that, Kami of Earth!

Ulp!

Once you die, maybe I ought to send you to Hell.

P-Please forgive me!

I never imagined you would be able to hear that!

You've got the devil's own ears, all right! Get it?

You've no sense of humor, huh?

No...

Very well. if you want to go that badly, you may go to Kaio-sama.

T-Thank you very much!

I'll call over a guide for you. Go out that way and wait.

'Kay!

However...!

Don't come crying to me if you fall off of the Serpentine Road.

Well, do your best.

This whole year will be a challenge for you.

Yeah. I'm not sure what you're getting at, but anyhow, I'm gonna go and see this Kaio-sama guy.

Mm-hmm.

Thanks! Say hi to Mister Popo for me!

I have to say, Earth has attracted the attention of some real bad eggs.

This time around, things could get really dangerous.

Even if we wished for Shen Long to eliminate them,

I doubt he could prevail against the Saiyans' tremendous power.

Even with Son Goku receiving training from Kaio-sama, just how far will he be able to come?

Only Goku's son can save us.

How is Piccolo going to raise Son Gohan?

And with only the limited time we have, how exactly--

Shut up!

You're in the way! Would you leave, already?!

S-Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'm very sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

Thank you for waiting.

Now then, I will show you to the serpent's head.

The Serpentine Road is quite harrowing.

Are you in good physical health?

No...

I'm dead, so I suppose I ain't in very good health.

Say, what's this Kaio-sama guy like?

Sir, Kaio-sama is the gentleman that reigns over all other deities in the universe.

Oh, yeah? I'm sure he must be pretty strong, then.

We can't very well not say anything to Chichi about this.

Kuririn, you go over there and explain the situation to her.

Eh?! M-Me?!

It sounds like she's a domineering mother, so you're dead for sure.

Sir, we have arrived.

This is the Serpentine Road?

Yes.

What do I do now?

Please follow the serpent all the way down.

It leads to where Kaio-sama is.

It sure looks long.

Yes, sir. According to legend, it is about a million kilometers long.

A million kilos?!

Has anyone ever made it to the end?

Over these last hundred million years,

I believe that Great King Yama is the only one who has.

That older guy, huh?

But then, if there is someone who's made it there, maybe I'll be able to manage it, too.

Ah, please be absolutely sure not to fall into the clouds.

Beneath the clouds is where Hell is, after all, and you will not be able to return.

Oh, okay.

Aw, rats. I should have packed something for lunch.

That's okay, sir.

You are already deceased, so I doubt you will die of hunger.

Oh, yeah.

Well...

Oh, right! I have a favor to ask.

Yes?

Do you know Uranai Baba?

Yes, sir. She visits here once in a while.

Thank goodness! Next time she comes here, ask her to tell Old Man Turtle Hermit not to bring me back to life for one year, okay?

Very good, sir.

Let's see... for one year... to Mr. Turtle Hermit, right?

Okay, let's give this a go.

So as long as I don't fall off the snake, I'm fine, right?

Yes. Do take care.

Bukujutsu!!

"Son Goku... has been killed.

Please accept my condolences."

That might be a bit too much of a shock...

"Er, I'm sorry to have to tell you that Goku has passed on to his eternal rest..."

But then, he is coming back to life...

That's it! I'll go with cheerful!

"Uh, Goku is dead, but he'll be coming back to life really soon, so there's nothing to worry about."

Ah, Kuririn!

H-H-Hello...

What are you doin', babblin' to yourself out here?

Uh, well, er, y-you see... a-allow me to offer...

Hey there! Long time no see!

Ah, hello! T-Thanks for saying so.

I thought you were with Goku-sa and the others.

Ah, well, you see... t-the truth is, Goku d-d--d-d-d--

What?

"D-Don't worry about me," he says!

Oh, so he's goin' to be late after all?

Yeah! Yes. Actually, Goku won't be coming back...

You say he's not comin' back?

No! He is coming back to us very soon...

What are you sayin'?! I don't get it!

Now, now, let's not stand out here talkin'.

Come on in the house. Come on, come on.

Would you wake up already, son of Son Goku?!

We have to talk. Get out of the water.

Who are you? Father?!

Father! Where are you?!

Father! Father!

Father! I'm scared!

Lousy brat!

Don't give me any trouble!

Stop blubbering! Be quiet, or I will snap your neck!

All right, listen closely to what I'm about to say.

First, your father is dead.

You remember some of it, right?
He sacrificed himself in order to defeat that man.

Piccolo! Hurry! Do that technique again!

Do it!

Take this! Makankosappo!!

Father is...

Whoa, don't cry! I really will snap your neck!

You've heard about the Dragon Balls from your father, right?

Goku's friends are collecting them now to bring him back to life.

However, that's not what the matter is!

We managed to get rid of the guy that kidnapped you, but he said that in another year, there are some friends of his, who are even stronger than he was, who will be coming here. When they do, even with Son Goku brought back to life, there isn't a chance of us winning with just me and him. We need your strength, too. You're going to train to learn fighting tactics, and defend the Earth!

Huh? Me? Nuh-uh. I can't fight at all.

Apparently, you haven't realized it yourself, but the power you have hidden within you is something else.

That's why you're going to train to draw that power out, and become able to use it effectively.

No way. I don't have that kind of power.

You want to see some proof?

What are you doing?!
Wah! That hurts! That hurts! Stop it!
That hurts! Stop it! That hurts! That hurts!

Now, show me your inner power!
W-What the...?
A-Astonishing. It's greater than I imagined.
I'm having mixed feelings.
I'm about to raise someone who could become my greatest enemy in the future.

D-Did I do that?

That's right. it looks like you're starting to understand.
Whenever your emotions become substantially excited, you exhibit your intrinsic inner power.
But it only happens for an instant.
We can't win that way.
I'm going to beat the way to fight into you, and make you the ultimate warrior. Got it?

But I don't want to become a martial artist.
I want to be a great scholar.

Go ahead, then.
But do it after we defeat the two Saiyans that will be coming here in a year.
They're planning to exterminate everyone on Earth.
If they do that, then there is no future, or anything else, right?

But I'm scared.

Stop your whining! Do you want to get killed right now?!
We don't have time! We're starting right now!
Take off your top!

If my father is coming back to life, I want to be taught by him.

Too bad. Sure, he may be strong, but he's not at all cut out to be a teacher.
He has absolutely no sternness when it comes to others.
You can tell that just by looking at how spoiled you are.

Huh?

Whoops. I used up too much of my strength, and now I can't fly.


Wilderness Survival! A Moonlit Night Awakens Gohan!

W-What should I do for training?

At first, you don't have to do anything. Just live.

Live?

If, after six months, you've managed to survive, I'll teach you how to fight.

No! I'll be so lonely, I'll die!

You won't be lonely. This area is crawling with bloodthirsty beasts.

Oh, no! Don't do this! Don't leave me here!

You don't have time to be this spoiled now!

But I...

Manage to survive this six months somehow, and gain a little toughness first. Both physically and mentally. Do not forget that you hold the key to the fate of the Earth. Believe in your own power. And learn for yourself an effective way to bring forth that power.

But I...

Bye now.

Wait! Where is my food? My bath? My bed?

You think that stuff has been prepared for you, sweet prince? If you have to blame something, blame your own fate. Like I do.

Wait! I'm scared! Don't leave me!

Kami-sama, acting strange. Something wrong?

Piccolo really is different than he was before, somehow. There's no doubt he's still evil, but it feels like he's lost some of that wily coarseness he had long ago.

Popo think so too. Old Daimao not make Son Goku's son stronger.

What made me clearly realize that there is something odd about Piccolo is that when Son Goku's brother, Raditz, was killed by him, his soul went straight to the Next World. Up until now, the souls of those killed by a demon clansman did not cross over, and just suffered as they drifted between heaven and Earth. And yet, since Raditz went to the Next World, this is clearly not the Piccolo of old.

Piccolo now has good heart?

Perhaps he has become aware that my life, and thus Piccolo's life, has only one year left.

One year...?

Whether that's because Piccolo will be killed by the Saiyans who will be here in one year, or because my lifespan will run out around that time, I don't know. My death will mean Piccolo's death, and Piccolo's death will mean my death. Though I may be Kami, it's unpleasant knowing when I'm going to die. He must sense it, too. He must want to leave something behind, even if it is to Son Goku's son.

Then, Dragon Balls can only be used...

Mm-hmm. The next time will be the last one.

To think that Gohan was that strong! I had no idea at all. He is my child, all right! 
That's right! Nothing says I have to walk along the road, huh?
All right... I'll get there in no time like this!
Yow-ow-ow-ow!
That was close, that was close!
That's Hell down beneath the clouds.

Help! Somebody, help! I can't get down!

Crap! That guide said that once I was dead, I wouldn't get hungry, but here I am, famished!

What? You couldn't tell them?

I'm very sorry.

You mean, not any of it?

No...

You're hopeless. Geez, you've got no spine.

That's easy for you to say. If you saw Chichi-san's face, you couldn't tell her that Goku died.

Well, I can't blame you. But unless we do something... if we write her a letter explaining the situation, she might understand, right?

Yes, you're right! That's a good idea!

By the way, Kuririn, what about the Dragon Balls?

There were two of them at Son-kun's house, right?

I forgot.

You good-for-nothing!

I'm scared! I'm cold!
I'm hungry! I'm going to die!
Apples! Some apples have fallen here! Lucky me!
Oh, well.
It's sour! Yuck!
I want Chinese buns!
I want shaomai dumplings!

You dirty brat, making me take care of you!

I'm scared... I'm scared...

Mind you, this is the last time I help you out. From here on, if you can't survive, then that's all you were ever going to amount to.

Too bright!

I can't get down!

I'm hungry!

I'm scared!

If you're hungry, you could come down from there and look for something to eat.

And after I told him, "Make sure you come home before nightfall," too!
It's been a long time since Goku's visited the Kame House.

He just got wrapped up in talkin' about the good old days and lost track of time.

That may be fine and all for Goku-sa, but Gohan has his cram school!
Missin' one day of cram school isn't that big a deal.

You're too lenient, Pa!

From here on in this world, it's those that study who come out ahead!

I wonder if that's got it...

Hey, I'm finally done!

You've got some nerve, kicking back and sleeping at a time like this!

You there, Old Man Turtle, stand up.

O-Old Man Turtle?

I've changed the characters in the display to make it easier to understand.

Let's see...206!

206? I'm not that young.

That's the number that represents your strength, Muten Roshi-sama.

The number that represents my strength?

That's an incredible device, huh?
It can tell you that?

B-Bulma-san, how high am I?

Amazing! it says 239.

I really have surpassed you, Muten Roshi-sama!

H-Hey, are you sure it's not malfunctioning?

--I don't mean to brag, but my skills are...
--Hey!

Hey!

Who is that calling to us in such a strange way?

It's me.

Y-You're that guy who was at Karin-sama's place...

--Armadillo!
--It's Yajirobe, ya nincompoop!

Ya screwed up my name on purpose!

Karin asked me to come here an' deliver a message to ya!

A message from Karin-sama?

"I am aware of the whole situation."
So you, that Yamucha guy, Ten-somethin'-or-other, and Chaozu are to go there at once.

Huh? All of us, go to Karin Tower?

Why?

Kami-sama, ya see, says he's gonna be givin' us trainin'.

I'm in on this, too.

R-Really?!

Yeah. I told 'im, I ain't up for fightin' them whatchamacall'em aliens, but he says I gotta do it, or else.

I've had it.

A-All right. I'll go find them all, and come, right away.

Bye, then. Can't say I didn't tell ya.

Oh, yeah. Forgot somethin'.

Goku says not to bring 'im back to life 'til them enemies get here.

Huh? W-Why not?

Word is he's gonna train there in the Other World.

Some old lady named Uranai Baba'll be comin' by shortly, an' you can ask her all the details.

W-What? When?

T-Training in the Other World?

W-What the...?

Huh?

He's coming back again.

Ahoy, Muten Roshi-ssms!

It's Chichi and Gyumao!

Muten Roshi-sama, what do we do?

I haven't written that letter yet.

Muten Roshi-sama!

It has been too long! Have you been well?

Er, um, I-I suppose...

My Goku-sa and Gohan are supposed to be here.

Where are they?

U-Um, t-the truth is...

Mumble, mumble, mumble...

He's been taken away by Piccolo Daimao?!

W-What happened to G-G-Goku?!

H-He's dead.

Chichi! Buck up!

How did something like this happen to me?

Huh?

I wonder why it's so light out.

Ah, it's the moon! Wow, it's completely round!

This is the first time I've ever seen a full m--

What?!

At this rate, Earth will be destroyed before the Saiyans even get here!

W-What's going on here?!

Don't play dumb!
It's when the moon becomes full that we Saiyans really start hitting our stride, you know!

That's it!

The full moon!

Get lost!

I-I never imagined he would transform.
Is it his Saiyan blood?
I think I'm starting to understand the secret behind his and Son Goku's power.
It looks like blowing the moon away was the right answer.
It makes me shudder, thinking that the Saiyans might turn into monsters like that.
He said something about their tails, too.
Apparently, to transform, they need their tails and the full moon.

I guess I'll pull out his tail.
Not that I have to worry about it anymore now, but their tails seem to be the Saiyan's weakness.
There.
I suppose I can provide you with clothes and a sword, at least.
I'll make it the same design as your old man's.
The character on it will be different, though.
I have to go attend to my own training, so I'm leaving.
If you can survive here safely for six months, I, Piccolo, will personally put you through special training hell.
So much so, you'll wish you had died.
Brace yourself for it.
I'm going to turn you into a fine demon clansman!


The End of the Line is Reached! Playful Trials of Kaiosama"   

I have to go and attend my own training, so I'm leaving. And so, six months' time has passed. 

All right! 
Oh, is it you again? You 'll never learn, will you? 

Hey ! I'm over here! Nyah-nyah! 

Okay , I'm going to get some more meat now! 

Your tail is going to be all gone before long. 

Hmph, looks like he's gotten a little more favorable. 

A-Ain't I at Kaio-sama's place yet? 

Well, with this many people on our team,  I'm not at all frightened by those Saiyans. 

I can't wait to see what kind of training Kami-sama will give us. 

Mm-hmm. 

We've been apart for half the year now. 
You look like you've gotten a little more favorable. 
Now then, time to start actually putting you through the wringer. 
Come at me! 
What's wrong with you?! 
Over here! 
Do not lose sight of your target! 
I can't see anything move that fast! 
You don't see it. 
You feel it. 
Yeah, that's easy for you to say... 
Ow-www! 

I still ain't able to see the end? 
The tail! I did it! 
I made it! 
Yahoo! 
Huh? 
There's nothing here! 
Aw, man, you're kidding! 
What's that? 
That's it! 
That's where Kaio-sama is! 
Yahoo! 
Sure enough! There's a house there! 
What?! 
What?! 
What?! 
W-What's wrong with the ground here? 
Damn... 
Incredible! it's like I'm being sucked down by an unbelievable power
I-It's no use! it's like my body is as heavy as lead! Damn it...!
I finally... made it this far...
I'm... going to meet...Kaio-sama... no matter what!

A little farther... a little farther...

Just a little farther...

But before I do, I'm gonna find something to eat.

Yow-w-w-w...

K-Kaio-sama? Are you Kaio-sama?

I'm sure he must be awesome, despite how he looks.

G-Good day. I am Son Goku.

I kindly ask for your training.

Kaio-sama, teach me your martial arts, okay?

I mean, please?

I-Is that training?

You want me to move like that?

Kaio-sama, w-what's the matter with the ground here?

Say, what are you doing there?

How about this heat?

What are you doing there?

Huh? W-Who are you?

Who, me?

I am...

...scratch, scratch, scratch...

Kaio!

Then, who's that?

That is my pet, Bubbles-kun.

O-Ohh! And here, I thought it was strange.

You're the strange one.

By the way...

That pun there was the best, don't you think?

You may feel free to laugh at it.

At what?

You must have been too tense to hear it.

What am I to do with you, honestly?

Well, I'll hit you with
another pun, no extra charge.

Hello? Hello?

That's great!

What is?

What have you come here for?

I-I was hoping to have
you train me, Kaio-sama.

Train you?

What is that?! You call that defending?!

You've got to focus your Ki more!
I'm just itching to kill you!

Training, huh? I'd be willing to do that.

Really?!

However...

...you have to pass my test first.

I'll do it once you can make me,
Kaio-sama, the wizard of gags,

laugh at one of your gags.

Eh?! Me, make a pun?!

Losing your nerve, are you?

It has to be a pretty high-level pun,
or I won't laugh at it.

Well, how about it?

It looks like this might be too much for you.

In that case, give up and go home!

M-My futon...

...flew away ["futtonda"]!

Y-Your futon... flew away...

Ah! You laughed! Kaio-sama, you laughed!

You're no slouch at this,
are you? I'll bet you're a pro!

Very well, I shall train you.

I'm going to tell you...

...my greatest gag!

N-Never mind the gags,
teach me some martial arts.

Oh, martial arts? Why didn't
you say so in the first place?

All right, try coming at me!

I'm going to see just how good you are.

What's wrong?

That's just it, there's something
that ain't right here.

My body feels so heavy, it's hard to move.

Where did you come from? Earth?

Mm-hmm.

Then it would be heavy for you, huh?

This is a small planet, but it has
tremendous gravity, you see?

I'd say it's about ten times
what you have on your planet.

So your body weighs ten times as much, too.

Try jumping for me. As high as you can.

O-Okay.

I-It's no use. I can only
go up that short distance.

To be able to jump that high
in ten times his own gravity...

This guy has a lot of promise.

Well then, I'm going to start your training.

How long do you plan on staying?

I don't know how many days I've been
running down the Serpentine Road,

but I don't think I've got that much time.

You see, these Saiyan guys
are coming to our planet

to do some awful things.

So until they do, however short that time is,

I'd like for you to train me.

The Saiyans, huh?

You've drawn the attention of
some formidable folks, all right.

Let's see...

Let me check to see when the
Saiyans will arrive on Earth.

Those are Saiyans flying there, all right.

They'll arrive at Earth in, let's see,

I'd say 158 days.

Awesome! You can tell that much?

These handy antennae are nice
and steady. Get it?

That was great!

Maybe I won't train you after all.

That was great! That was great! That was great!

Wasn't it?

But, I ain't got but 158 days
until the Saiyans arrive?

Hey, 158 days will be plenty.

If I train you on this planet for 158 days,

it will have the same value
as training back on Earth

for thousands of years.

--Really?!
--However...

...even if you do train, you won't
necessarily beat the Saiyans.

That's how terribly strong the
two Saiyans headed to Earth are.

Frankly, their strength is
even greater than mine.

Greater than yours, Kaio-sama?!

That's right.

Which means that if you
can't at least surpass me,

it will be impossible for
you to beat the Saiyans.

Well, we should get started right away.

Hey, Bubbles-kun!

First, you have to overcome
the severe gravity here.

Try to catch Bubbles-kun here.

If you can't at least move
that fast, you'll get nowhere.

A-All right.

Okay, run away, Bubbles-kun!

Hold it!

D-Damn it! My body really does feel heavy!

Damn!

All right...

Just you watch!

I'm gonna catch you!

Oh, he's already wearing
super-weighted gear, is he?

This makes me quite a bit lighter!



The Battle With 10-Times Gravity! Goku, Your Training is a Race" 
  

It's amazing the way you eat...
You could be a little more...
Hey, how about holding back a little?

I'm full, I'm full!
The flavor notwithstanding, at least my belly is full.

I'm getting the feeling that this man doesn't respect me.

You know something, Kaio-sama?
I'm surprised you don't get bored staying on this little planet.

How young you are.

There are any number of fun things to do here, if you feel like it.

Like counting how many blades of grass there are, looking up at the sky, or peeing for distance.

Lately, the hobby I've been caught up in......is going for drives.

Now, hurry up and catch Bubbles-kun.

Otherwise, I won't ever teach you any martial arts.

Y-Yeah, I'll try my hardest.

All right...

Oh, yeah...

Put those heavy-looking clothes and boots you took off earlier back on before you start running.

That will make this more effective.

If I put those on, it will be much, much harder to run.

I'll let you in on a little something.

The world that the Saiyans are from had about the same gravity as here.

That's where they built up their bodies.

Are you starting to understand the secret to the Saiyans' strength?

But there's more to it than just that.

Saiyans have an inborn fighting sense.

That's another dangerous thing about them.

Hey, that's all right. I'm a Saiyan, too!

Nice jab.

But don't let up on your attack!

Uncle!

Help me!

Don't try playing the baby to me, you dirty brat!

Sure enough, he only displays that latent power of his on a night with a full moon.

Ow-w-w-w...

Hmph, it looks like you've at least gotten over your crybaby ways during these last six months, huh?

Say, Piccolo-san, you fought with my father long ago, right?

That fight still isn't over yet.

If we're able to defeat the Saiyans, your father's turn will be next.

But Father said that after you were reborn, Piccolo-san, you don't seem to be as full-blown bad as you were before.

I kind of think so, too.

My mother and grandfather were afraid of you, though.

Stop talking rubbish and get to sleep, already!

Tomorrow's training won't be as gentle as this has been!

Right!

Damn it all...

And so, in the blink of an eye, three weeks went by.

I doubt you know how good......these shao-mai dumplings taste...

That was great, that was great!

Huh? Is anyone listening?

Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it!

I've got a whole pile of potstickers!

Hold it!

Now!

So close!

Rats!

All right...!

Oh, you're sure in high spirits, huh?

--Hold it!
--I knew it! They really don't respect me!

He really is awesome, huh?

But he's not gonna get the best of me!

I'm so close...

That's it! All right!

Sure enough!

All right!

Hold it!

I did it!

I finally did it! I caught you!

He's as amazing as I thought.

He's already overcome the gravity here, has he?

He just might be able to master the Kaio-ken.

Get up, already!

Don't get cocky, just because you've
managed to dodge me once or twice.

You're still soft!

Help me!

Get back up here, by yourself!

Ten-san and Yamucha-san have
both become even more incredible!

Yajirobe, take this seriously!

Why, you...!

Yow-w-w-w-w-w!

I did it!

I did it, I did it!

Kaio-sama, what should I do next?

What should you do? Let's see...

--You're willing to do anything?
--Yeah.

Then how about grinding 
some sesame seeds?

Kaio-sama, I have to train
quickly, or the Saiyans will...

Hmph, don't be so hasty.
You still have 117 days.

That's no time at all!

What was that?

It's about time for it to come back.

Come back?

Here it comes...

That was great, that was great! Not bad at all.

Are you really all that strong?

How rude!

W-What was that?

Y-You look like a grasshopper, huh?

G-Grasshopper?

That's ridiculous!

--Ah, that was great!
--Y-You are ill-mannered.

My name is Gregory, and I look after Kaio-sama's personal care.

Kaio-sama, the one who governs all other deities in the universe...

"That's ridiculous!"

Ahem. You have some nerve, saying,

"Are you really all that strong?" to Kaio-sama.

There's a limit to how much ignorance I can stand.

But I ain't got a whip.

Son Goku, you show a lot of promise!

Kaio-sama, this is no time for you to be laughing!

This works out perfectly, Son Goku.

After Bubbles-kun, you will next be taking on Gregory there.

This guy?

What is that look on your face for?

I was hoping to get trained by Kaio-sama himself.

Kaio-sama, I am downright enraged!

I would like to take this fellow down a peg for taking me so lightly!

--May I?
--Very well.

What's that?

K-Kaio-sama, that's a little on the large side, isn't it?

Son Goku, here!

Well? Heavy, right?

Your next training is to swat Gregory using that hammer.

With this?

Once you are able to do that, I will train you myself.

All right, I'll try!

Hmph, as if a rookie like you could ever catch me!

H-He's fast!

Damn!

It looks like this is going to take a while.

Ow-w-w-w... All right, I'll get you this time!

Huh...?

That little jerk!

Hold still, you!

Wait up!

He wouldn't!

I-it's nice that's he's so high-spirited...!

I swear I'm gonna get stronger than the Saiyans!

Rats!

You have all far surpassed me.

There is nothing more that Mister Popo and I can teach you.

From here on, until the conflict is upon us, descend back down to the ground, and each of you hone your techniques.

The future is in your hands now.

Right!

Uh, so it's okay fer us to get outta these heavy shirts now, right?

Do as you wish.

Guys, let's get back down there and put the finishing touches on!

We should be able to power ourselves up even further.

We've all become amazing!

Goku, I can't wait to see what will become of you.

After two weeks of carrying the hammer...

Almost there!

He's relentless!

All right...!

Oh, no!

Say your prayers, Gregory!

I did it!

It'd hurt if I whacked you as hard as I can, after all.

Wishful thinking. My body is harder than even rock.

You won't be able to win against the Saiyans like that.

Oh, yeah? Then again, you've got a bump there.

Ee-yow-w-w-w!

There are still days left.

Knowing him, he might be able to master the Kaio-ken!

Kaio-ken, something I've dreamed about, but ended up never being able to master myself.

And also, that other surefire technique.

Kaio-sama, you promised.

You may think you're ready for this, but my training is even tougher than you can imagine!

Can you withstand it?!

Mm-hmm, I'll give it a try!

As long as you're aspiring to be something, be the best in the universe!
The best under the heavens!

Both in body, and in mind! Got it?

You got it!

Sis, I'd like you to tell the fortune of the Earth.

What's that? The future of Earth?

I want to know what will happen next year.

All right. I'll try divining it.

It's no use. This time, not even I can predict the future.

Oh, dear.

All right! That's it!
You're starting to control your Ki!

Weak!


Come Forth, Shenlong! The Saiyans Finally Arrive on Earth" 


This will be your final day of training with me.

Your punning studies may have come up a little short, but for the most part, I've taught you what I know.

Let's review what you've learned up to now.

Mm-hmm.

First up is Bubbles.

Ready...

Start!

Oh! 0.8 seconds! That's a new record!

Next, Gregory.

Right.

Ready... Start!

Okay... here goes!

Huh? Ow!

1.2 seconds.

Unbelievable!

Okay, next?

All right, finally, let's check your Genki Dama.

I've been waiting for this.

All right, ready, Kaio-sama.

Mm-hmm. Okay, here we go.

See if you can track the super speed of this giant brick.

Mm-hmm!

Here goes!

Okay, super speed!

Like it was nothing...

Well done, Son Goku. I honestly didn't think you would be able to handle the Genki Dama this well.

I worked hard on it.

Mm-hmm. It may sound like I keep repeating myself, but the Genki Dama is a technique that lets you take a small sliver of energy from the grass, the trees, people, animals, and every other conceivable thing, including the air itself, gather it together, and then release it.

Mm-hmm. It really is an awesome technique.

Even on a planet as small as this, the Genki Dama had that much destructive force.

Earth, where you'll be fighting, is much larger, compared to here.

Also, you'll have the tremendous energy of the Sun on your side.

Your Genki Dama will have astounding power.

If you're not careful, you could even destroy the very planet you're trying to protect.

If you can help it, don't use it.

If, and only if there's nothing else you can do, I give you permission to use it just once. Got it?

Mm-hmm, got it.

I'm sure I'll be able to manage with just the Kaio-ken.

Okay then, the day of your battle is almost upon us.

The Saiyans will arrive on Earth tomorrow.

Huh?! O-Oh, no!

W-What? What's the matter?

Uh, listen, I didn't calculate the time it will take you to travel the Serpentine Road to get back!

K-Kaio-sama, ain't you capable of whooshing me back to the lower realm?!

No, uh, I can't.

I-I've got to go back down that road?!

It took me over half a year to get here!

A-As you are now, you can arrive there in two days.

I'll tell Earth's Kami to pick you up there.

B-But I'll still be one day over!
Everyone will be killed!

Stop your griping! Even I make mistakes once in a while!

Now, hurry up and tell your friends on Earth to use their Dragon Balls or whatever to bring you back to life!

T-Tell them? But how?

Place your hand on my back, and speak in your mind.

It will get through that way.

Really?

Like this?

Mm-hmm, like that. Hurry and tell them!

O-Old Timer, it's Goku. Can you hear my voice? Hey, Old Timer!

Man, this girl is downright...

G-Goku? Is that you, Goku?
W-Where are you?! Where are you?!

He hears me! Old Man Turtle Hermit, I'm still in the Next World.

I'm speaking to you through my mind from a faraway place called Kaio's World.

T-The Next World?

Have you gotten all of the Dragon Balls together?

Y-Yeah. We've long since gathered them.

Everyone looked frantically for them so we could rescue you.

Thanks. So then, I hate to ask, but could you summon Shen Long, and bring me back to life right now?

The Saiyans will be getting to Earth tomorrow.

W-What?!

T-Tomorrow, already? That's a whole month earlier than we thought! Hurry, Old Timer.
I'll be just a little bit late, but I'll definitely manage something.

Hey, Goku...!

Er, I can't breathe!

Ah! Sorry!

A-All right, got it. By the way, Goku, what do you say?

We'd heard that you were training in the Next World.

Any luck with that?

Mm-hmm, you bet!

I-I see. That's a relief.

H-Hey, is he all right?

Old Man Turtle Hermit is talking to himself in the bathroom.

I wonder if he's going dotty.

Hey, get the Dragon Balls ready, right now!

That was awesome, Kaio-sama!
I got right through to him!

Naturally.

I can finally come back to life!

All right then, while we're waiting for you to come back to life, let me do something about that heavy, ragged outfit of yours.

Eh? Really?

Watch.

Awesome! it's lighter!

It's not just lighter. it's made out of a wonderfully sturdy fabric.

It can even repel minor attacks.

Thank you, Kaio-sama!

Wow, terrific! You left the "Turtle" mark where it was!

I was worried that if I had clothes like yours, Kaio-sama, I wouldn't look very cool.

Well, excuse me.

Ah, I hope they bring me back to life soon!

The mark on the back is the snazziest point on it, huh?

Hmm? Yeah!

What's wrong? You can't defeat the enemy by just dodging him!

All right!

Whoops, I got carried away. 
Was that a bit too strong?

That was no fair. You said you weren't going to use your eyes.

Don't be such a baby!

Do you think a promise like that means anything in a fight?!

B-But Piccolo-san, you're not the enemy.

Now, come forth, Shen Long!

It's the middle of the day, but it's suddenly dark out.

E-Excuse me, here...

Don't touch me!

N-No matter how many times I see it, it's still scary.

Speak your wish. I shall grant any one wish.

S-Say, um, I suppose we couldn't say we wanted him to dispatch the Saiyans, and save the Earth, could we?

What are you talking about? Are you thinking of keeping Son-kun dead?

I-It's not like that. it would be nice and easy to just have Goku brought back to life the next time, right?

That is an impossible wish.
I was created by Kami.

As such, I cannot grant any wish beyond Kami's power.

Well then, please bring Son Goku back to life.

That is an easy wish to grant.

Son Goku is about to be resurrected, huh?

Which means, the Saiyans will be coming sooner than we thought!

All right, the halo over your head has disappeared.

You have been brought back to life!

Hooray!

--Go on, hurry!
--Right!

Remember, your enemies are evil men, more powerful than you can imagine!

They won't let you drop your guard for an instant!

Don't go thinking you can be brought back to life again!

That's all right. The Dragon Balls can only bring you back to life once.

I'll give them everything I've got! Just you watch!

Mm-hmm.

Thanks for everything, Kaio-sama!

Once I die, I'll come see you again!

Bubbles!

--Gregory!
--Take care!

Bye, now!

Bye!

What unfathomable strength that man has.

And yet his heart is even clearer than crystal.

To think that there would be someone like him in the lower realm.

Kaio-sama, he has become even stronger than you, huh?

Still, his sense of humor wasn't that great.

The next time he comes here, I'll train him on that.

Oh, hush, you. Just hush.

Wow, so light, so light!

My body feels as light as a cotton ball!

Oh, right!

This ain't no time to be thrilled. 
I have to hurry!

And so, the next day at 11:43 AM......Earth at last allows the two Saiyans to trespass upon her.

Papa, I'm hungry.

Oh, is it already this late?

W-What was that?

What happened?

T-This is stunning...

It looks like something fell from the sky.

S-Sure enough. That round thing fell out of the sky.

There's one over here, too.

It's a person!

A person came out of it!

Over here, too!

It's a person!

W-What...?

So, the Saiyans are finally here.

They have an incredible Ki, huh, Piccolo-san?

T-Ten-san...

Tch, that was a lot sooner than we thought.

It's just about time for the Saiyans to arrive.

Hurry!

Guys, hold out for me!


Yamucha's Struggle! The Terrible Saibaimen"


W-Who are they?

What are they?

He called it Earth, right?
Not a bad planet, is it?

How about we say hello to the noisily peeping chicks here?

Go easy.

W-What was that?!

W-What the hell have they done?!

W-What the...!?

I-It's unheard-of!

That greeting may have come out a little too civil.

Leave it at that, Nappa. if you get too showy, we won't be able to sell this planet for a high price.

O-Oh, right.

Come to think of it, we have to look for those whatever-they're-called balls that can grant any wish, too.

Dragon Balls.

First thing to do is to find the one who killed Raditz, and get some information about the Dragon Balls out of him.

Yeah, right.

But if the Dragon Balls were in this area, our wish to gain eternal life just went up in smoke, all thanks to your mindless "greeting."

S-Sorry. it completely slipped my mind.

Well, what's done is done.

Now, let's look for the one who has the highest battle power.

That will be the one who killed Raditz, after all.

That's strange.

There are more than just one or two battle power readings over 1,000 .

Why would this planet have them?

Don't lose your cool.
They're still no match for us.

Let's just find the one with the highest battle power.

I've found him.

There are two fairly high readings together.

All right, Nappa, let's go have some fun with them.

The cause of this large-scale earthquake is still unknown.

Further, we are currently unable to make any contact with Metro East, thought to be the epicenter of this earthquake, and there is concern for the safety of its residents.

T-They've finally gotten here!

Shall we go to help? I can tell where they are with this.

Y-You'll get me to go over my dead body!

I-I'm going! I'm certain that Yamucha-sama will be going there!

No, we'd better not.

The difference in our levels is too great.

Even if I was there, I'd just be in the way.

All we can do is stay here and hope the others are victorious.

Son-kun, hurry back!

Hurry back!

Just hold out until I get there, guys!

This is great! This planet Earth has fairly little gravity, and I can just whip around!

They're moving at incredible speed!

They're heading straight for the place where those two other large Ki are.

They're coming! They intend to come here!

Right!

Chaozu, you stay here!

No way! I'm coming, too!

There's nothing to fear.

We've gotten so much stronger than we were a year ago, there's no comparison.

R-Right!

There's something coming from over there, too!

And there are others coming this way, too!

Are there more than just two Saiyans?

Is that a Saiyan?

Yo! Long time no see, Piccolo.

Oh, it's you.

What business do you have here?

Have you come so you could get in our way?

It looks like there are some other fools about to come here, as well.

Yeah, I'm sure everyone will be coming.

I was the one who was closest.

I remember! You're the one who was at the Turtle Hermit's place.

Yeah, I'm Kuririn. You've sure gone and gotten more beefy, huh?

Just like Goku, when he was a kid.

You're small, but strong, right?

That's what Father always used to say.

You're going to fight with us, right?

Goku said that, did he?

That's enough chit-chat. They're here!

There they are! There's one more of them.

Now there are three tough-looking guys here.

Apparently, they are well aware of who we are.

It looks like they've been waiting for us.

That's right.

Just for the record, let me ask you...

Why the hell are you here?

That voice! I see.

You're the one who killed Raditz, right?

Voice?

Didn't Raditz tell you?

These things work as communicators, too.

He's a Namekian.

So it seems. I guess it's not so surprising

that Raditz would have been killed by him.

Namekian?

Namekians, in addition to having above-average fighting power, are said to possess some mysterious abilities.

I-I'm a Namekian?

I've also heard that there are some of them that perform magician-like tricks. So that's it.

You must be the one who created the Dragon Balls, right?

T-They even know about the Dragon Balls?!

The Dragon Balls are our main objective.

Hand them over to us, nice and easy.

You may be a Namekian, but you and the others there are like bugs to us!

Thanks.

Because of you, I'm starting to get an idea of my ancestry.

But unfortunately for you,

I'm not the one who made the Dragon Balls!

I specialize more in fighting, you see.

Come and see if I'm like a bug to you!

Kami-sama...

I-I didn't know.

To think that I am an alien.

No wonder I thought I was a little different from everyone else.

Indeed, I was the one who created the Dragon Balls long ago.

But even though it was my first time making them, they seemed oddly familiar.

There was probably something that someone made on this planet "Namek," that were like the Dragon Balls.

Nappa, take off your Scouter.

What?

These guys alter their battle powers in response to their fighting.

These ratings aren't reliable anymore.

Come to think of it, you're right.

That weakling Raditz lowered his guard because of the Scouter rating, and got himself killed.

R-Raditz is that Saiyan that you and Goku teamed up on, and just barely managed to beat, right?

And he's a weakling?

I know. Let's have a look at these guys in action.

Hey, Nappa, we still have six Saibaimen, right?

Get them out.

Vegeta, you like playing around too, huh?

S-Saibaimen?

W-What are those?

There are six of them, all right.

This soil will grow some fine Saibaimen.

W-What are those?!

There.

T-Those guys are disgusting!

Your targets are those three.
Work them over, Saibaimen!

Gohan, don't lose your nerve!

Right!

You want us to start coming after you, now?

Kuririn!

Tenshinhan!

Chaozu, you came, too?

Mm-hmm.

I thought there were only two Saiyans.

Well, a lot has happened, and there's more of them now.

It's all the same, no matter how many of them there are.

Is that him? Goku's son?

Yeah. it looks like Piccolo has trained him quite a bit.

Kuririn, sorry I'm late.

Yamucha-san!

Everyone's here but Goku. 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...and 6. interesting. That's exactly the number of Saibaimen we have.

What do you guys say?

How about each of you fight our soldiers in turn?

It will be a game.

A game?! Rubbish!

Enough of your beating around the bush, let's settle this, right now!

Now, now, why not? it works out to our favor.

Goku isn't here yet, after all.

Fine with me.

I'll take you on first. Come and get me!

This guy is gonna be floored once he finds out how strong the Saibaimen are!

You go first. Hit him as hard as you can. Got it?

Gohan!

You got him!

That's our Tenshinhan!

Amazing!

I-Impossible! The Saibaimen's battle power is 1,200 !

They rival Raditz when it comes to power!

That just means that his battle power is higher.

B-But...

it's a simple miscalculation.

That's not what our data says!

Nappa, these guys look like they can provide us with a little entertainment.

V-Vegeta, how could you do that?

That Saibaiman underestimated his opponent.

I told him to go after him as hard as he could.

W-What a creep!

T-That Saiyan blew that monster to pieces in an instant.

What destructive force!

Well, who is next?

A-All right, I'll take you on!

Wait, Kuririn.

Y-Yamucha-san?

Let me go first.

I want to show them that we've had it with their playing around.

Yamucha-san, I could just as well--

You've already been brought back to life with the Dragon Balls once.

If anything were to happen, you couldn't be brought back again.

Let me take care of this.

I'm going to get rid of the remaining five all at once.

Such a lovely friendship we're seeing.

All right, you take him on.

Okay, come and get me!
Don't go taking us so lightly!

What is this weird uneasiness?

I've got a bad feeling about this.

Piccolo, find a way to hold out until I get there.

Please!

T-They vanished!

You fool! They're moving at high speed!

Sense out the movement of their Ki!

T-The movement of their Ki?

Everyone besides you can see them.

Eh? Everyone can see them?

All right...!

Use your whole body as your eyes.

Use my whole body as my eyes...

You see them?

I see them!

You're not getting away!

You got him!

A-Amazing...

H-He did it!

The earthlings have the upper hand!

He did it!

He did it, he did it!

Not again!

Hmph, it looks like these monsters aren't as strong as you think.

W-What did you say?!

Don't get excited, Nappa.

I'll take care of the remaining four myself, as well.

It looks like this time, you're the one who underestimated the Saibaiman.

What?!

O-Oh, crap!

T-This is bad.

Yamucha!

Yes. That's more like it.

W-What a monster! He blew himself up!

T-That's awful...

H-He's dead...

Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

Yamucha-sama!

Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

Yamucha-sama!

Y-Yamucha-san must have had a bad feeling about this.

T-That's why he went instead of me... Damn it...

Damn it! What am I supposed to tell Pu-erh and Bulma-san?!

What a pathetic Saibaiman! A draw?!

What did he think he was doing, against scum like that?!

Hey, get that filthy, tattered mess cleaned up.

D-Damn you!

Everyone, stand back!

Yamucha-san, I will make sure I avenge you.

Let me show you the results of my training!


Sit Tight, Chaozu! The Screaming Kikoho of Tenshinhan" / "Sit Tight, Chiaotzu! Tien's Screaming Tri-Beam!

Let me show you the results of my training! 

Go! 

What's with the slow-motion blast? 

You got them! 

Wow, amazing! 

Kuririn, are you okay? 

Yeah... but I missed one of them. 

To hell with you! 

That's Piccolo for you. 

Just thinking that he might be our enemy again gives me the chills. 

Thank you, Piccolo-san. 

Don't get the wrong idea. 
As if I would rescue you. 
I was just warming up for the wonderful fight that's about to begin. 

Let's hope that's how the fight turns out. 
Well then, as you wish, shall we put an end to the fun and games? 
The real battle is about to begin. 

I-Impossible! 

They aren't fazed at all! 
I hit them at full power! 
That's what Saiyans are like?! 

Let I take them. I'll finish off all five of them in an instant. 
Suit yourself. However... Don't kill the Namekian. 
We have to get information about the Dragon Balls out of him afterward. 
Okay then, do your best to make this entertaining. 

I'll start... ...with you! 

Let me handle this! 

Piccolo-san! 

It looks like this is going to be sort of fun. 

W-What? 

T-The whole ground is shaking... 

I-It's no use, Ten-san! 
My supernatural powers have no effect! 

T-This can't be! 

H-How can this be? 

I had no idea it would be this bad! 

Hurry! Hold on, guys! 

All right...! 

Chaozu, watch yourself! 

Tenshinhan! Dodge him.

Ten-san!

What fragile folks these are.

Now to finish you!

Damn you!

Tenshinhan-san!

Damn it! Tenshinhan!

Wait! He's had it! Let him be!

Shut up!

Stay out of this!

I can't see the bottom of the hole...

Unbelievable! What a tremendous energy wave!

D-Damn...

Nappa, look behind you!

--Chaozu!
--Why, you...!

You little punk!

Chaozu! Get away from him!

Chaozu, that's enough! Get away from him!

T-Ten-san...

Thank you...

W-What are you talking about, Chaozu?!

Get out of there! Hurry and get out of there!

I enjoyed being together with you.

Chaozu! What are you thinking of doing?!

Farewell, Ten-san. Please don't die.

Stop! Chaozu!!

Ten-san!

Chaozu!!

He blew himself up, taking them both out.

A pretty drastic thing to do.

Nice work, for the little guy.

That was a worthless thing to do.

N-No way! How can he still be fine?! That's terrible!

Chaozu even gave up his own life!

Chaozu... h-has already been brought back to life once with the Dragon Balls!

He can't ever be brought back to life again! Damn it!

I swear you'll pay for this!

It looks like you still don't realize how terrifying we are.

All that remains for you is death!

I-It had no effect at all!

Chaozu won't be able to rest in peace!

Chaozu...

Be grateful. I'll send you to see him in the next world, right away!

Y-You'll pay for this!

I swear you'll pay for this!

A-At this rate, Tenshinhan-san
will be done in as well!

I have to do something!

Stop!

We'll have a brief opening during the instant when he moves to attack.

Wait for that moment.

Got that, Gohan?

Yes...

That's a good strategy.

Best of luck with that.

Are you sure you should be looking away?

You'll miss your chance.

Heh, you sure are sure of yourself.

But you'll stop making that stupid face once Son Goku gets here.

Ho? Who's that? Your ace-in-the-hole?

Just you wait and see.

Looks like that's all for you, huh?

I'll come put you out of your misery, right now.

See you in hell!

Now! Scatter, Kuririn and Gohan!

Yeah!

I'm gonna finish you! Die!

What?!

Gohan! Now! shoot him!

Gohan!

Get yourself ready!

I-I'm too scared!

You filthy brat!

It's not working!

We missed him! Our timing was too late!

Now you've done it! You've just shortened your own lives even more!

Fine. I've decided to change the order that I kill you in!

Say your prayers!

I-I'm sorry... Uncle Piccolo...

What is wrong, Kami-sama?

Hmm, it would seem my life will only last a little longer.

Death... death is closing in on me.

You cannot mean...

Piccolo is going to be killed.

And so is everyone else.

W-What about Goku?

Hmm... l still don't sense his presence.

Goku, hurry!

Ch-Chaozu...!

We've always fought together...

...and now, you can't be brought back to life!

Ten-san... I'm sorry...

Chaozu...!

You were fools to upset me.

Now, which one of you will I toy with first?

I'll leave the Namekian just barely alive.

Have to get more about the Dragon Balls out of you, after all.

Chaozu... l will avenge you,

and then I will be coming!

I won't leave you there feeling lonely!

This is... this is my... last...

K-Kikoho!!

Oh, did he get him?!

Don't startle me like that!

I-It had no effect on him!

That monster! Is he immortal?!

C-Confound it...

Fool!

He could have just stayed down, but he used up all his power, and died for nothing.

O-Oh, no... not Tenshinhan, too...

This is horrible... it's a nightmare...

Everyone is dying, one after another...

Goku!! Get here, quick!!

Goku!!

Hurry!

Hurry!!

Goku?

Why do you keep saying--

Hold on...

I put another one of you away.
Now, it's your turn!

Let's get back on the ground and fight.

He's far better at fighting in mid-air than we are.

It'll be the same, either way.

Flounder about, flounder about!

Here goes!

--Here he comes!
--Father!

Nappa! Wait!

W-What?! Why won't you let me at them?!

Don't be hasty. There's a little something I want to ask them.

This "Son Goku" you keep talking about is Kakarrot, right?

That's right! So what if he is?!

To think that your last resort would be Kakarrot!

What good will he do once he gets here, when he didn't stand a chance against even Raditz?

He's not like he was before!
He's gotten much, much stronger!

Don't you go making light of Son Goku!

For all of that, he doesn't seem to be coming, does he?

Are you sure he hasn't gotten scared, and run away?

H-He'll be here! My father will be here for sure!

And he's going to beat you guys up!

That's some faith you have in him.

This should be interesting.
We'll wait until he gets here.

You're kidding, right?! Let's put these guys away, right now!

However, we'll only give him three hours.

We won't wait any longer than that.

This is ridiculous! I'm going to play now!

Nappa! Didn't you hear what I said?!

S-Sorry. I got a little carried away there...

That's the deal. You should be grateful.

You'll get to live a little while longer.

You can't blame him. This is his first real fight, after all.

Hmph! What a sap I am for expecting anything out of you.

Get lost, you pantywaist.

I have to say, though, the way that big guy was cowering just now...

Does that mean the runt there, Vegeta,

is even more ridiculously strong?

I'm aching to do something!
I can't wait any longer!

Now, hold on. Three more hours.

In three hours, we'll be witness to a hellish horror show.



Will Son Goku Be in Time?! 3 Hours Until the Battle Resumes"   


Why do we have to wait for Kakarrot?

Because he is a traitor to us Saiyans, and we have to inflict punishment on traitors.

We're going to kill his son and his friends, right before his eyes.

Afterward, we're going to serve him up as well, nice and slow.

We're going to show him how powerless he is, as he writhes in agony.

And in another three or four hours......we will be able to give him a fantastic, hellish show!

I get it! So that's it! That will be great!

That is, if he gets here in the next three hours.

You can have Kakarrot, but let me take those other three!

Suit yourself. However......do it after you get the information about the Dragon Balls out of the Namekian.

I sure hope Kakarrot does come.

Say, at this point, why don't we run away?

There's no way we can win.
This is no time to be stubborn.

You fool! Either way, they're planning to wipe out humanity.

We'll end up the same way even if we don't flee now.

D-Damn! Please, Goku! Get here!

Show them how much, much stronger than them you've become!

Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

Still not yet?

Guys, hang in there a little while longer!

Piccolo, Goku is sure to get here in the next three hours, right?

Who knows?

Think about some way to inflict even a little damage on them before Son Goku gets here.

P-Piccolo-san!

P-Please train me again during these three hours!

Don't act like a baby!

I have no need for pantywaists.
Go on and get out of here.

P-Piccolo-san...

Piccolo!

I've drilled everything into you.
You're more than just this.

Gohan! Come back!

Gohan!

Kid, are you trying to run away?

Not that that isn't the smart thing to do!

Who's running away?!

Your momma's belly button sticks out!

That little brat!

H-How did he know that my mom's belly button stuck out?

W-We're going to try to get as close to the scene as we can.

What on earth could be going on? 
I'm not certain of the details, but could it be that they are taking a time out?

Maybe I'll go have a little fun.

I can't just sit around here waiting for three hours.

Do as you wish. But Nappa, don't let it get too out of hand.

Why not?

For the sake of the hell show we'll be having in three hours.

Oh, right, Vegeta.

I'll keep it to just a friendly greeting. Don't worry.

One of the Saiyans has flown up into the air!

Where in the world could he be headed?

H-He seems to be headed in our direction, and is quickly drawing ever closer!

H-He's coming after us!

He's coming!

Swing the camera around!

R-Run!

You're a blight! Get lost!

By the way, has Goku not arrived yet?

Regardless of how funny my gag was, this is no time for laughs.

The fate of Earth is at stake!

Hurry, Son Goku!

I see it!

I'm almost there!

Goku's presence?!

Yeah. He's getting close!
He just might make it in time!

One more hour, huh?

Kakarrot isn't chickening out on us, is he?

It's all or nothing. It looks like that's all we can do.

He's here! Son Goku is here!

Kami-sama, quickly!

It's the end of the Serpentine Road!

T-That was fast! That was remarkably fast!

Hmm? There's a powerful Ki, divided into two! What's going on?!

And so, three hours pass without Goku showing up.

It's time.

Damn!

It appears that waiting for him didn't do any good.

He's still not here?

No, the coward Kakarrot has not come.

My father is not a coward!

Damn, why isn't he here?!

Son Goku...

Now then, to give them a thorough working over...it's too bad we won't be able to show this to Kakarrot.

There's only once chance for us to be able to beat this guy.

Of course, that assumes that everything goes smoothly.

Listen up.

First, Kuririn, you go after him and draw his attention as much as you can.

Then, I'll find an opening and grab his tail, the Saiyan's weak spot.

O-Oh, right.

Once he loses his strength, and can't move anymore,

Gohan, you wring out all the power you've got and charge him.

Right! I won't run away this time, so it will be okay.

Of course you won't. Remember that the fate of Earth is in your hands.

Gohan, have faith in yourself.
If you set your mind to it, your power is even greater than mine.

All right...!

--Goku!
--Kami-sama!

Hurry! Grab on!

If you please!

T-That kid really did make it back here from Kaio-sama's place.

Okay, I'm off! My training went great!

--We're counting on you!
--Good luck, Goku!

Mm-hmm!

Guys! Gohan! Please be alive!

Here he comes! Son Goku is quite exhausted!

Hey...!

Karin-sama!

My last two senzu beans! Here!

Thank you!

This really helps!

We're counting on you!

I'll use one right now!

All right, full strength!

Kinto Un!

Long time no see!

You're on!

There's an incredible gathering of Ki!

That way!

All right, here goes!

Ha! He's leading off by charging right at me!

Draw his attention!

Now!

W-Why, you!

Gohan!

You fool!

I-Impossible...!

P-Piccolo-san!

Whoa, don't go dying, now!

You still have to tell us about the Dragon Balls.

T-T-This can't be...!

Hell of a miscalculation, huh?

Did you think we would leave our weakness untrained forever?

That's a shame.

The best fighter on this world, reduced to this with just one blow!

P-Piccolo-san!

Shake it off!

Now then, while he's gone beddy-bye, I guess I'll play around with the little ones.

I'll start with Kakarrot's son.

Hey, you carry true Saiyan blood.

You're bound to offer me a little fun, right?

Hey, now, don't go croaking on me yet.
Play with me a little more!

That's the spirit!

You bastard!

Ho... his movements, at least, are something else.

Let me show you something I've been saving!

Kienzan!!

What a sorry technique!

Nappa! Dodge it!

That idiot! Couldn't he tell what kind of technique it was?!

Damn...!

W-Why, you...!

How dare you... how dare you cut my face?!

Get out of my sight!

I'll finish you!

You're awake already?

Y-You punk!

Looks like they're giving you trouble, Nappa!

Don't you... don't you look down on Earth, Saiyan!

Why, you! Now I'm furious!

I was going easy on you, since I can't kill you because of the Dragon Balls, and now you've gotten all full of yourself!

You're the one who's full of himself!

W-What is that Ki?!

There's a tremendous Ki heading here from far away!

I-It's true!

An amazing, yet familiar Ki!

N-No doubt about it... I-I can feel it...it can only be him! Son Goku!

Just a little farther, Goku. Hurry. Hurry!

It's Son Goku! Son Goku is coming!

I-I just knew he would come!
Damn that punk for keeping us waiting!

F-Father! Father is coming!

Hurry! Hurry!

G-Goku...

These guys have a strange power by which they can sense presences.

Is it Kakarrot? Let's see...

They're close! I can feel it!

Two huge Ki, and two even more huge Ki! There's one small Ki!

T-The numbers don't add up!
H-Has somebody died?!

Kinto Un, hurry even faster!

Vegeta, is what they're saying true?

Is Kakarrot really headed this way?

I don't know if it's Kakarrot or not, but somebody is going to be here in about four minutes.

Someone with a battle power of 5,000 !

- 5,000 ?! I-impossible!

Nappa! kill them!

If the four of them team up together, they could become a problem!

They'll also serve as an example for Kakarrot!

What?!

B-But what about the Dragon Balls?

No matter! I have an idea!

If we go to that Namekian's home world of Planet Namek, they're sure to have even more powerful Dragon Balls there! I thought it was just a silly story, but if Kakarrot has really come back to life, then the legend is true after all!

I get it. All right...

I'll start with you!

P-Piccolo-san! Run!

I'll keep him busy somehow until Father gets here!

What?!

After all, Piccolo-san, if you die, then Kami-sama dies, too, and the Dragon Balls will be...

What kind of nonsense is that?!

There's no way you can keep him busy all by yourself!

Don't make me laugh! You little brat!

No!

You brat! You're through!

O-Oh, no!

Die!!


Tears Shed by Piccolo... Son Goku's Furious Counterattack!" 
  

 I'll save you! 

I told you to run... 
Hurry , or else... 

Don't die! 
Father will be here soon,  and he'll beat them up! 
Please , don't die! 

That fool! 
My kill order has been changed,  but no matter. 
It's all the same either way. 

O-One of the Ki is growing smaller in a hurry. 
S-Somebody is dying! 

It looks like my life is about to run out... 
G-Goku didn't make it there in time... 
But at the very end, there,  Piccolo surpassed me,  as Kami... I'm so happy... 

Kami-sama! 

T-This is so pathetic... I-Imagine, Piccolo Daimao, of all people, p-Protecting a little kid... it's appalling... 

U-Uncle! 

Gohan, you're the only one who ever talked to me one-to-one. 

But Father said that after you were reborn, Piccolo-san, you don't seem to be as full-blown bad as you were before. I kind of think so, too. My mother and grandfather were afraid of you, though. 

That was no fair. 
You said you weren't going to use your eyes. 

Don't be such a baby! 
Do you think a promise like that means anything in a fight?! 

B-But Piccolo-san, you're not the enemy. 

T-This last year with you wasn't so bad... 

Uncle! Don't die now... 

G-Go... han... 

Uncle!! 

Mister Popo, I leave the rest in your hands... 

Kami-sama! Kami-sama! 

This should be good! 

You wanna go at it?!
Masenko!!

His Ki is incredible!
... 1,500 ...2,800 ...
Battle power 2,800 !
These guys can acutely alter their battle powers!

2,800 , huh?
That was a pretty incredible move, for a little kid!
My arm stings a little.

His battle power is dropping like a stone.
It looks like he used up all of his power on that one shot.

P-Piccolo-san, I'm sorry.
I was unable to avenge you.

Gohan! Run! Run away!

Kid, I'm sending you into the next world for sure this time!

I don't even have the strength to run away anymore.

I can't wait to see Kakarrot's face when he sees......his own son, smashed to a pulp!

K-Kinto Un?!

Father!

Goku!

So, you've finally shown up.

Why have you taken the trouble to come here, Kakarrot?

Don't tell me you've come to tell some ridiculous joke about how you're here to defeat us.

Piccolo...

Piccolo-san died protecting me.

Tenshinhan...

Yamucha...

Are you in shock at seeing all of your foolish, fallen comrades?

Come to think of it, there was another little runt, who got blown to shreds.

He had decent power, despite his tiny size.

So, Chaozu, too...
And Kami-sama, as well. Damn!

No need to grieve for them.
You'll be joining them, soon enough.

Here you've gone and come back to life, and you just nonchalantly show up here.

His battle power is rising fast.

What? You're ready to die already?

Accept this by way of greeting!

He's fast!

Gohan, this way.

--Kuririn...
--G-Goku...

Sorry I took so long.

I'm impressed you two made it through.

Here. Each of you eat half.

T-That's a senzu bean, isn't it?
Karin-sama still had some?

Mm-hmm. This is the last one.

Then you eat it.

It's all right. I had one before I got here.

No, you hold on to it, just in case.

Even if we recover now, we won't be any help.

Don't worry about it. if you don't eat it, I'll throw it away.

Here.

Thanks.

Gohan, you, too.

Mm-hmm.

Kuririn, you've improved incredibly, huh? I can tell by your Ki.

I thought I had, anyhow, but it's no use.

It didn't do any good against them. They're too strong.

I... I just watched as everyone else died around me...

Gohan, I barely recognized you, either.

You sure have trained hard.

Mm-hmm. Piccolo-san trained me.
But I wasn't able to do anything.

With Piccolo-san dead, we can never use the Dragon Balls again.

We can't bring anyone back to life.

Let's all three of us avenge them!
Goku, with you joining in, we might at least be able to get one of them!

Hey, Goku, you trained under some terrific guy named "Kaio," right?

Yeah.

But I'm going to fight them by myself.

You guys watch from a distance, so you don't get caught in the middle of it.

B-By yourself?!

You may be strong, Goku, but that's crazy!

Their strength is far greater than we can imagine!

H-He's right, Father!

G-Goku...

F-Father!

Let Goku handle this.

B-But...

I've never seen Goku filled with that much anger.

T-There's no room for us to intrude here.

What's with that face you're making? I don't like it!

You want me to kill you, just like that?

You're going to pay for this!

F-Father is incredible!

Battle power 7,000 ... 8,000 ...

impossible!

Vegeta, what has Kakarrot's battle power gone to?

More than 8,000 !

More than 8,000 ?! That must be some kind of mistake! A malfunction!

Don't you worry. I still won't use Kaio-ken against you.

Kaio-ken?

Shut up!

There's no way you can stand up against the great Nappa!

What?!

H-How did he do that just now?

W-When did you get behind me?

W-Why, you...!

For all your swaggering, you ain't all that great.

W-What did you say?!

I-I'm not all that great?!

That's right. I can tell from that attack just now.

Why don't you explain to me......exactly what it is you can tell?

Strange. it's as though his battle power is completely different from when he fought Raditz.

Over here!

D-Did you see your dad move?

Uh-uh. But it was amazing.

How can this be?

How did Kakarrot gain this much power in such a short time?

That one was for Chaozu!

Damn it!

This is for Yamucha!

Why, you......filthy little brat!

Ain't no need for me to even dodge this!

W-What?!

H-He countered it with just a ki-ai shout?

D-Damn you!

This one is for Tenshinhan!

H-How?! How can Kakarrot have this much power?!

What?!

And this one is for Piccolo!

Damn it!

A-Awesome! You really are awesome, Goku!

Yes!

Damn it all!

I see. You're incredibly tough. I'm impressed.

I am a highborn, elite warrior!

I will not be made sport of by a lower-class warrior like you!

I'll get you for this! I'll kill you!

You idiot! Cool your jets!

If you think it through rationally, you'll see he's not an unbeatable opponent!

Nappa, calm down!

Right... Thanks, Vegeta.

Thanks to you, my eyes have been opened.

Tch! Simple-minded fool!

At this rate, I'm going to have to take over.

It's true, all the blood had rushed to my head, but from here on, I'll show you my true colors.

Are you ready for this, Kakarrot?

That's more like it.
I'm looking forward to this.

Talk tough, will you?

He's not just talking tough.

He possesses assurance and absolute self-confidence.

G-Goku...

Father...

I see you!

Whoo! This is much better, ain't it?

This is better?

I'm gonna close that insolent mouth of yours for good!

This will finish you!

What a freak!

He struck back at that close range in that brief instant!

Whoa, if I had taken that one full-on, it would have been trouble.

I-Impossible! That was my greatest technique! You just brushed it aside!

You really are a tough bastard.

The Kamehame-Ha should have taken at least some toll.

If this keeps up, we ain't getting anywhere.

That's enough! Come on down, Nappa!

You're getting us nowhere!
I'll take care of him!

What?!

You're pathetic!

Imagine, me, actually having to take action against Kakarrot!

H-He's finally going to start in?

Even the big guy there is intimidated by him.



This is the Kaioken! The Critical Battle of Goku vs. Vegeta" 
  

D-Damn.

T-To think that I'd have to turn over your execution to Vegeta.

Orders are orders. I'll let Vegeta take care of you.

But I can't let it end with me withdrawing like this.

Crap! The other two!

It's no use! I won't make it in time!

Kaio-ken!!

What?!

Damn...!

He ain't able to fight anymore.

Take him, and get yourselves off of Earth, right now.

W-What was that just now?

For a moment, his speed and power shot up sharply!

G-Goku, how did you do that?

Is that a technique you learned from that Kaio-sama guy?

Yeah. it's called " Kaio-ken."

By controlling all the Ki in your body, you amplify it momentarily.

If you do it right, your power, speed, destructive force, and defensive force all multiply many times over.

T-That's awesome! As strong as you've become, you can still become many times stronger than even that?

--Yeah.
--Goku, you're such a tease!

This is no time to be playing around, right?

If you had that up your sleeve, you should have used it from the start.

Sorry, I couldn't do that.

If I don't control it while throttling my Kijust right,

I could really mess myself up.

Basically...

Just to press the point, at your level, you cannot use the Kaio-ken too heavily.

If your control slips up, you'll end up damaging your body.

Keep your power down to double, at the most. Understood?

Performing a Kaio-ken beyond that will put too great a strain on your body.

Put another way, your body won't be able to keep up with the Kaio-ken, and it will end up backfiring on you.

Mm-hmm, I got it.

And that's the story.

O-Oh...

V-Vegeta... h-help me...

T-Thanks...

Hmph, not at all.

W-What are you--

Vegeta! Vegeta!!

I have no need for a Saiyan who can't move!

W-What a Ki!

F-Father!

W-What's going on?!

Die!

V-Vegeta!!

W-W-What a monster!
He even killed his own buddy!

Gohan, Kuririn, the two of you go on back to the Kame House, right now.

R-Right.

Gohan, you heard him. Hurry, let's go.

B-But...

Gohan, he's too much for us.

We won't be of any help if we stick around here.

And our being here will just distract Goku, and make him worry over us.

Really, Father?

Sorry about that.

It looks like his strength is greater than I thought.

O-Okay, I understand.

Oh, yeah. Goku, as long as you're fighting, could you do it in another location?

It wouldn't do to let everyone's bodies here get all messed up, once we bring them back to life again.

Bring them back to life?

Piccolo is dead, so Kami-sama is dead, too.

The Dragon Balls are now gone forever.

I hate to say it, but they ain't ever coming back to life.

Yeah, I know that.

K-Kuririn-san, by any chance...

W-What?

I'll explain it all to you later.

That is, if you're able to beat him, Goku.

If I can beat him, huh? Yeah.

I have to beat him, at any rate, no matter what.

What are you waiting for?

What happened to all that enthusiasm you had a moment ago?

Have you lost your nerve and decided to huddle up and run away?

Okay then, well, I guess I'll change locations, and do my best.

In any case, let me handle this.

Goku, sorry about always having to leave our fate up to you alone.

Don't you dare go dying now, my good friend.

Yeah.

Father...

Gohan......after Daddy comes back home alive, let's go fishing together or something, okay?

Okay!

It looks like you realize that there's no use in running away.

We're going to change our battle location.

Suit yourself. it will all turn out the same.

Father...

I should have known as much.

He's following with confidence to spare.

Gohan...

Hey, Gohan!

--Yes?
--Let's hurry back to the Kame House.

Mm-hmm.

Let's stop worrying. We've turned over the fate of the Earth to him.

It'll be all right, Gohan. 
Goku is sure to take care of him.

Now, let's go. Hurry back and show your mother that you're all right.

Right!

Here should be all right. There ain't any people or animals around.

I see...

So this is the place you've chosen to be your grave, is it?

You should rejoice.

After all, a lower-class warrior like you is going to get toyed around with by a super-elite.

Soon after Saiyans are born, their capabilities as soldiers are tested.

The scum whose ratings are low are then sent to worlds without tough opponents, like you were.

In other words......you were an outcast!

And as a result, I was able to come here to Earth.

I should be grateful. Besides......maybe even an outcast can surpass an elite if he tries desperately enough.

That's a pretty good joke.

Well then, let me show you a wall that you will never be able to get over with effort alone!

What's the matter, Kakarrot?!
You can do better than that, can't you?!

You were giving more than this when you beat Nappa!

Let me see it!

Impressive. He ain't even taking this seriously yet, but his speed and technique are already beyond mine.

Show me, unless you've already used up all your strength.

All right! I'll show you!

Kaio-ken!!

If that was the limit of what you've got, I'm going to be very disappointed.

What a brute this guy is...

But then......for as much trouble as I'm in right now, I'm starting to get excited.

He's laughing? Has he given up hope, and turned defiant?

Or does he know he is capable of raising his battle power even higher?

Well?! Are you done already?!

That appears to be all you've got.

Well then, allow me to show you something before you die...

The overwhelming power of a super-elite Saiyan!

That disagreeable grin of yours is going to be wiped away soon enough.

What a Ki! it's as if the entire Earth is trembling!

It's a full-on typhoon!

The air has stopped quivering.

A-All of the clouds have been blown away.

It's over, Kakarrot.

You fool! Behind you!

Kaio-ken, times two!!

All right, nicely dodged.

I made that one easy for you to dodge.

It wouldn't be any fun if you died too easily.

Damn, what power and speed he has!

Not even my times-two Kaio-ken can keep up with him.

Ain't much else I can do, huh?

This may wreck my body, but it's better than dying.

I ain't got any choice but to raise my Kaio-ken to triple-strength.

I've already come so close, so there's no point in not checkin' them out, and what do I see?

That punk and Goku're both so strong, it's like I'm havin' a nightmare.

Now then, once I raise my Kaio-ken to times-three, I wonder how long my body will be able to hold out.

What's the matter, Kakarrot? Come and get me!

Either way, I've got no choice but to do it.

The way things are going, there ain't any way I can win.

Don't you have anything else up your sleeve?

Looks like you messed with the wrong guy.

Even among the other Saiyans, I was the most powerful man around.

No matter how much you may have trained, you're still just an outcast!

You've only put off the time of your defeat by a few moments.

This ain't good.

That Saiyan bastard has him completely overpowered.

Maybe I'd better get outta here while I can.

Uh-huh, I oughtta beat it.

It don't do no good for me to be here, nope.

May my body withstand this! 
Times-three Kaio-ken!!

N-No! You can't exceed double-strength, Son Goku!

Then again, as it stands, there's definitely no way he can win.

Imagine, that guy being so strong...

This battle... may be hopeless.

W-What's wrong?

H-Has something happened?

It's probably Son-kun, but this battle power reading

I-Is rising like crazy!

--Goku!
--Goku-sa!

17,000 ... 19,000 ... 21,000 ...

O-Oh, no...

W-What?!


The Impact of the Kamehameha! Vegeta's Tenacious Transformation"
  

Times-three Kaio-ken!!

Awesome, man...

Why, you...!

Y-You miserable...!

H-He's got 'im! He just might win this!

I-Impossible! How can his...

How can Kakarrot's battle power be greater than mine?

D-D-Damn, this guy is tough.
I have to settle this quick, or else...

S-shoot, my body...

I-I'm not going to let this happen!

I am a super-elite!

There's no way I'll be beaten by that lower-class warrior!

I am the best in the universe!

S-Sure enough, it looks like using a triple Kaio-ken is too much for me.

If this drags out too long, I'm the one who will be done in first.

Blood!

My noble blood has been spilled by that piece of trash?!

I-I won't allow it! No way... No way will I allow it!

Who needs this planet anymore?!

I'm going to blow you and all of Earth into tiny pieces!

You're gonna what?!

Go ahead and dodge this if you can!

You might save yourself, but Earth will be blown to pieces!

Damn, he thought this through!

I'll have to risk it!

A triple-Kaio-ken......Kamehame-ha!

Ka... me......ha...

There's no way you can stop my Gyallic-Ho!

...me...

I'll turn you and the whole Earth into space dust!

...ha!!

W-What?! It's just like my Gyallic-Ho!

Kaio-ken......times four!

I-It's pushing me back--

H-H-He did it! He did it!

Son! Ya did it, you magnificent bastard!

Yajirobe? What are you doing here?

What, you didn't notice?

For as strong as even you are, you sure did bust yer tail there, huh?

--Yeah, I guess.
--But then, way to send that awesome dude flyin'!

You sure are one helluva stud, there.

W-What? What'sa matter?

I-I used a technique that was too much for my body to take.

Oh, yeah? Well, it wasn't nothin' normal, that's fer sure.

Never mind me, Yajirobe, you should get out of here.

What for?

Y-You don't mean...

He's still alive. if that's all it took to kill him, it'd be too easy.

B-But it's no sweat, right?
You're the stronger one.

I told you, I overdid it, and now my body is falling apart.

I might be just about maxed out.

I-Is that right?

Well, then...

G-Good luck with that!

D-Damn it!

How?! How can Kakarrot's battle power be greater than mine?!

Damn it all! I am a Saiyan!

I am the strongest one in the entire world!

At this point, as much as I hate how ugly it is, it's time for my last resort-- to transform into a Great Ape, and crush him!

My strength as a Great Ape is overwhelming!

Damn it, I chose to arrive here on the day of the full moon so that we could wipe out the people of this planet quickly, but I never thought I'd have to transform just to defeat Kakarrot!

This really burns me up!

That's strange. it's well past time that the moon should be visible.

Saiyan, no matter how hard you look, it won't do any good.

The moon isn't there.

That Piccolo fellow was afraid something like this might happen, and got rid of it long ago.

Still, Goku can't have very much strength left.

Even if the Saiyan doesn't transform into a Great Ape, it doesn't change the fact that he's in trouble.

But then, he's growing weaker, too.

The Genki Dama! If you can hit him with a Genki Dama, you'll beat him for sure!

That's weird. He's just hovering around up there.

Why doesn't he come down after me?

It's gone! it's gone! it's gone! Damn it!

The moon isn't anywhere! How can this be?!

I get it. Damn it! That bastard is driving me right up the wall!

Kakarrot took out the moon before we even got started!

Now I've got no choice.

My battle power might drop a little bit, but it doesn't look like I've got any other option.

Ha, I can't wait to see the look of panic on his face!

He's finally coming back down.

The only way for me to beat him is with a Genki Dama.

Will I be able to focus enough?

Kakarrot!

You may have thought you were clever, getting rid of the moon, but it's not going to work!

The moon? What do you mean?

And now you're playing dumb.

Do you know why it is that we are able to transform when we look at a full moon?

Transform?

The light of the moon is that which is reflected from the sun.

It is only when sunlight is bounced back by the moon that it contains Bruits waves.

When the moon is full, those Bruits waves exceed a value of million zenoes.

What is this guy talking about?

Once at least million zenoes of Bruits waves are absorbed by the eyes, the tail responds to it......and the transformation begins!

There are a limited number of Saiyans that can artificially create a full moon that produces more than million zenoes.

Your gambit won't play out!
Despite getting rid of the moon, when the oxygen of this planet mixes with my Power Ball...

Sorry to keep you waiting, Kakarrot.

Your death is finally at hand!

A lower-class warrior shouldn't have challenged a super-elite like me to battle, anyhow!

The moment he produced that strange light, his Ki dropped.

What is he planning to do, that he would go that far?

What?!

Burst open and intermix!

W-What......is that? What have you done?!

Y-You don't mean...

H-He created a moon!

You're going to regret having lost your tail, Kakarrot!

'Ulp!

Is this the end?

W-What is that?

H-Hey, over there...

T-That's the direction we just came from.

What could it be? it's awfully bright.

T-This is impossible!

W-What is that? There's a tremendous Ki rising.

Father's Ki hasn't gone up again, has it?

N-No, this icky feeling is from the other guy.

And I have to say, his Ki is really something else.

What's going on?

F-Father...

Gohan...

I-I'm going back there.

I'm going back.

G-Going back? You mean, to where Goku is?

I-I just know that Father is in danger, and he's going to die if I don't do something.

What are you talking about, Gohan? Goku isn't--

There's no way your father is going to die, you know.

For one thing, even if we do go back, against a guy with a Ki like that...

Yes, I know...

Still...

I have to go! I'm sure of it!

H-Hey!

Wait up, Gohan!

What do you say, Kakarrot?

You're finished now!

W-What is going on here?!

A-A Great Ape? A Great Ape monster?!

I'm going to let you in on a little something.

The battle power of a Saiyan in his Great Ape form is ten times greater than before!

Goku, on the night of the full moon, a giant ape monster appears. 
You must not go outside then.

If you're asleep, you'll be safe.

I will fix it so that your tail never grows back.

It seems to be something of a nuisance, after all.

So that's it. I finally understand.

H-How can that be?

The monster that stomped Grandpa to death......and appeared at the tournament grounds, smashing them up......w-was me?

Forgive me, Grandpa.

This guy is ridiculously powerful.

Unless I use up all of my Ki, I doubt I have a chance of beating him.

Once I die, and go back over to the Next World, I'll come and apologize to you.

I'll show you, Vegeta!

I'm gonna cram a Genki Dama from me and the Earth right down your throat!

F-Father!

Goku... He's your son, all right.

K-Kaio-ken!

What's the matter?!

Can't you even run away?

Die!

What's the matter, Kakarrot?
Can't you deal with this?

A-As huge as he is, he's so fast!

There ain't enough time for me to focus to create a Genki Dama!

Not even a times-five Kaio-ken would work against him!

Hmph, you're not going to come at me?

In that case, I'll go after you!


Goku in Absolute Peril! Entrust Your Wishes to the Genki Dama"   


T-That's it!

Tenshinhan! I have to borrow your move!

Taiyo-ken!!

Now, while the brightness has blinded his eyes...

M-My eyes! My eyes!

A-All right. With this much distance...

T-The Land......the Seas......and... all living things...

Each of you, share with me just a little bit of your genki energy!

I beg you!

Damn it! What an insolent thing to do!

A-A little more... a little more, and I can create a Genki Dama...

W-What's he doin'?

He's starting to get his sight back.

Still, at this distance,

I'll be able to launch my Genki Dama before he can attack.

Damn it, where are you?!

Where are you?!

Where did you go?!

It's no use trying to escape!
I can sense your presence!

The genki energy is collecting!

Why, you...!

He found me! Please, let there be enough time!

I-It's done! I've collected the genki energy of the whole Earth!

--All right!
--Take this!

W-What was that?

What happened?

I-I never expected him to attack like that...

I-I really misjudged things...

Good grief, the Genki Dama I worked so hard to make is now gone.

Hmph, you're one tough bastard.

But then, you look like you've almost had it. I can tell.

He's got me. Now, I ain't even got a prayer of beating him.

I used up nearly all of my Ki on that Genki Dama just now.

Well, what will you do now?!

Goku's Ki is falling off, fast!

F-Father!

Hurry! We're almost there!

Whoops! Sorry, sorry!

Looks like I accidentally stepped on you, crushing your leg.

Well, this time, let me accidentally crush your heart!

This is the end for you, Kakarrot!

Even if you come back to life again, this planet won't be here when you do!

D-Damn it, he's completely beaten me.

I never imagined there'd be such a gap in power between us.

I'm glad there's someone this strong out there, but if I'm dead, it's just frustrating...

Hmph, die!

That's my last, parting shot...

I-I ain't even got enough strength left to blow my nose now...

D-Do what you will with me...

Why, you!

Kakarrot, how dare you...

How dare you scar my face?!

I'm going to squeeze you to death!

He's in a tight spot! it's no use now, he's dead!

It ain't like I've abandoned you, okay?

T-There's nothin' I can do, after all.

Don't go holdin' it against me.

Suffer good and hard, then die!

We're close! They're right over there!

Because of that weird ball of light, it's still this bright out, even though it's the evening.

What in the world is that thing?

K-Kuririn-san! Over there!

Get down, Gohan! Descend, and hide!

W-What is that?

Hurry, you dumb-ass!

I-It's those guys!

It can't be! He's turned into a Great Ape!

It felt like most of your bones broke just now.

Does it hurt? Eh?

Goku is getting killed. This is bad!

--This way!
--Right!

--Hey!
--Yajirobe!

Hey, who d'ya think that monster is?! it's the Saiyan!

I know.

There ain't no way you can go up against that monster! Stay put!

I know that, too.

But if we cut off his tail, he'll go back to normal.

--His tail?
--His tail?

Listen, Gohan, you and Yajirobe swing around in front of him, and draw his attention.

I'll wait for an opening, and cut off his tail from behind.

Hurry! Goku is gonna die!

R-Right!

H-He's gotta be kiddin' me! Draw his attention?

You guys might not know 'bout this, but even at his normal size, he's still unbelievably strong!

Father, don't die!

Goku's Ki is all but gone!
Damn it, he's about to die!

Father! Don't die!

There's someone there!

--Where are you?!
--Down here!

Let my father go!

Ho ho, this is a surprise. if it isn't Kakarrot's kid!

I get it, you came here just to see your father's last moments, huh?

Good timing! He's right at the point of death.

I was just about to finish him off.

Kienzan!!

Watch closely, now.

I'm going to crush him until there's nothing left.

Kuririn-san, hurry!

Unfortunately, it looks like he's already lost consciousness.

I-I-It can't be...!

Did you really think I wouldn't realize

that there was another one of you here?

You guys seem to enjoy worthless sentimentality, after all.

I figured this kid wouldn't just come wandering back here alone, so I was keeping an eye on the situation.

Apparently, you knew about our tails. Too bad, though.

Just you wait! After I'm finished with Kakarrot, you'll be next.

D-Damn! What a freak! Even as a monster, he's still level-headed, and on guard.

I'm sorry Goku. I hate to just stand by and let you die, but this guy's Ki is too great.
I can't even get close!

Your mistake was to try to challenge me to battle!

Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

Stop it!

Oh, you want to die before your father, do you?

O-Oh, no!

What's the matter? Too scared to move?

Leave me outta the rest of it!

D-Damn it! I-l didn't know there was another one of you!

M-My tail!

I-It's cut... His tail has been cut off!

You did it, Yajirobe!
He's gone back to his original size!

W-Why, you miserable...!

You want to die so badly, you'd make me mad?!

W-What's going on? Why did that monster...?

In that case, as you wish, I'll kill you, you trash!

Gohan! Run!

I'll start with you!

A Saiyan half-breed is strong, right?!

Show me your true power!

Heh, maybe there's been a change in the order.

Now, get up! Amuse me a little more.

Hey, what is this? Is this all you've got?

Does that mean the child of scum is scum, as well?!

You may be scum, but at least your blood is still red.

Want me to at least let you die next to your father?

I can be gracious.

Here!

G-Gohan...

Ho, Kakarrot, you're a tough one.
You're still conscious, are you?

Gohan, Daddy's all busted up on the inside...

I-I can't move...

Y-You have to fight in my place...

His power has to have been reduced significantly...

I-I can't, Father.

H-He's too strong. I can't beat him.

All right, this is the order I'll go in:

First, I'll kill Kakarrot. Next, Kakarrot's kid.

After him, I'll finish off that bald-headed bastard from earlier.

And lastly, the one that cut off my precious tail!

He remembered 'bout me!

Y-You don't have to beat him...
J-Just keep him at bay...

Your power should be much better than this... much better...

And then, I'll have Kuririn finish him off...

I can't do it. I can't move anymore, either.

You jackass! Do you want everyone else's death to be in vain?!

What did Piccolo teach you?!

I'm counting on you, Gohan...

G-Gohan...

Give me trouble, will you?!

You're nothing but outcast scum!

S-Stop... that...

Stop that!

What?

I'm going to......defeat you!

Hmph, you are going to defeat me?

What?!

Kuririn! Kuririn, please! Come here!

Damn it...

Don't you mess around with Vegeta!

Goku, this is impossible. He's just too strong.

Why didn't you tell Gohan to run away?

K-Kuririn, I'm going to give you this, before it's too late...

The Genki Dama I've collected from the whole Earth...

W-What did you say? What are you giving me?

A G-Genki Dama. A little Ki I've gathered from all over the earth...

About half of it has gotten away, but the way he is now, I still think it's enough to defeat him...

W-What?

Kuririn, hold onto my hand...

I-I don't understand any of this.

Hurry! Gohan is gonna die!

Y-You just want me to hold onto your hand?

Please...

Like this?

Your arm is broken, isn't it?!

Just like that. Don't let go.

I'm giving it to you... Take it...

W-W-What is this?

I-I-It's incredible! it's an incredible amount of Ki!

T-Take it, and focus it above your palm... it will create a ball...

You filthy brat!

Hang in there... Gohan ain't able to control this kind of Ki...

T-There it is! This is a......Genki Dama. Y-You did it...

Pesky brat!

Kuririn... hit him with it...I can't make another Genki Dama...

Y-You've got to make sure you hit him... Please...

A-All right. I'll try.



Dragon Ball Z Kai 

The Invincible Vegeta Defeated! Son Gohan Summons a Miracle" 
  
How strong he is...! 
He should be fairly worn out  from fighting Father, too... 

He 's quite the little runt,  but he seems to be just about at his limit. 

Masenko !! Ha! 

Is this your last-ditch defiance?! 

Rats! 
One more! 

Damn... With him moving around like that,  I don't have the skill it takes to hit him. 

You don't aim the Genki Dama using your eyes.  
You feel out the evil of his Ki, and then launch it. 

W-Who's there?! 

I am Kaio,  the one who taught Son Goku how  to use the Genki Dama. 

K-Kaio-sama...? 

Everything will be determined by your one shot.  
Know that the hopes of all the Earth are placed in  that Genki Dama. 

T-The hopes of all the Earth are placed in here? 

No matter how many of you scum team up,  you're still no match for an elite like me! 
Once you realized that, it was already too late! 

Feel out the evil of his Ki, then launch. 

I get it. 

Kuririn... I'm counting on you... 
You will only get one chance with this. 

I'm through playing around. 
Can you get away from this?! 

F-Feel it! Feel the evil of his Ki! 

He's fixin' to do somethin', huh? 
That's a huge wad of Ki. 
Well, if yer gonna do it, do it already! 

Watch this closely, Kakarrot! 
This is the end of your foolish son! 

I've got it! 

What're ya doin', dumb-ass?! 
Hurry up an' chuck that thing! 

That idiot! 
Damn it all! 

W-What is that?! 

Hit him! 
It missed!

It's hopeless now!

Bounce it back, Gohan!

Gohan, that thing is friendly fire!

If you ain't got any evil in you, you should be able to repel it!

They did it!

Yahoo!

We did it!

We did it! We did it, Goku!

Thank goodness! Goku!
We did it! We did it! We did it!

You guys finally did it, huh?

Mm-hmm.

I thought we'd had it, time and again, there.

You guys have both been run ragged.

Not as badly as you've been.

T-The Saiyan...

it's okay. He's dead.

Damn you. You were one hell of a beast, but I guess we should at least dig a grave.

You mean a grave for yourselves?!

T-T-That's impossible! He took that Genki Dama dead-on!

You've gone and done quite a number on me.

Even I thought I was going to die from that one.

I-I've taken a considerable amount of damage, but I still have enough strength to take care of trash like you.

Once I've killed you all, I'll wait and recover my strength, then completely destroy this planet!

Y-You've made me, Vegeta, use up nearly the full limit of my power.

And though it may have taken a number of you to do it, it wounds my pride that trash like you have done this.

Would you people drop dead already?!

D-Damn it... Damn it...!

G-Goku!

D-Damn it, I have to admit, that destructive force was pathetic.

All three of them are still clinging to life.

T-The damage was worse than I thought...I-I have to hurry up and take care of these guys......and then get some rest...

T-The little brat!

His tail has grown back!

H-His tail? Oh, yeah.

Way back when, Goku's tail also grew back all of a sudden.

Oh, crap!

If he were to transform on me, it would be trouble.

W-What?!

I done it! I done it!

Serves ya right, you jackass!

Nyah-hah-hah-hah!

How d'ya like that?! Yer no match for Yajirobe! Nyah-hah-hah!

Why, you...

You filthy bastard!

S-S-Sorry! Did that hurt? I-l was just kiddin' around! Did I cut ya?

Yeah! I got lotsa respect for you.
L-Let's you an' I be buds--

Y-Yajirobe...

Nobody, and I mean nobody wounds me and gets away with it!

D-Damn it...

G-Gohan!

Gohan!

T-That's Father's voice...

G-Gohan, listen to me...

Mm-hmm...

Look at the ball of light in the sky
...B-Ball of light...? Ball of light...?

O-Oh, no! I won't let that happen!

Die!

Oh, crap!

Y-You little brat! I'm not about to let you grow huge!

Damn!

I have to kill him, now, while I can!

G-Gohan, it's up to you...!

G-Gohan is turning Great Ape...it's an all-or-nothing gamble...

T-That's right, his tail!

I was in such a rush, I forgot the most important thing!

If I can just cut off his tail...

Gohan...

Then again, when Goku became a Great Ape, he had no trace of rationality.

What about Gohan...?

Gohan is the same way!

R-Right, it's not so much that Goku and Gohan lose their rationality, as it is that when they turn Great Ape, they revert to being violent Saiyans!

Wah! Stay away!

Gohan!

G-Gohan!

G-Gohan! The Saiyan!

Get the Saiyan!

W-Why, that...

Gohan!

Good! A small part of Gohan's mind still remains in there.

S-Sure, he's half earthling, after all.

The moon I created won't go out for another hour.

Sure enough, my only choice is to cut off his tail!

D-Damn! My power...!

Damn it!

I can't move!

W-What happened?

Did he get him?

H-He's still alive?

What is that?

There it is...

To think that I'd have to retreat...

D-Damn it, I, Vegeta, said to be the mightiest warrior in the universe...

T-That's his spaceship.

Like hell you're getting away!

We've come this far...

Now I'm gonna finish the job.

Hold it!

This is for everyone you've killed!

Say your prayers!

Damn it, my body won't respond...!


Dawn of the Fierce Battle... The Star of Hope Is Piccolo's Homeland
  

You've outdone yourselves to come this far.

I wasn't sure how this would turn out.

I'm not supposed to take sides, but that Saiyan was a villain who plunged the whole universe into terror.

I couldn't help it.

This doesn't mean that the root of this evil has been completely eliminated, though.

Not the root of it.

Die!!

Wait!

G-Goku?

W-Was that you who just spoke inside my mind, Goku?

Yeah, that's right. I can't talk very loud, after all.

K-Kuririn, forgive me for asking, but would you let him live?

A-Are you out of your mind, Goku?
This guy killed our friends, and was going to kill everyone in the world!

If we let him go now, he's sure to recover his strength, and then come back here!

Y-You're probably right.

If you're thinking that maybe he'll have a change of heart, the way Piccolo did, then you're greatly mistaken!

He's not like that!

I-I know. I know how ridiculously strong that Vegeta guy is, too.

Still, although I ain't able to explain it too well, s-seeing him there, about to die, made me think...

"What a waste."

W-What a waste?

A-After training at Kaio-sama's place, I thought I had reached my peak.

B-But that Vegeta guy there had far surpassed me.

It surprised me. To be honest, I was overwhelmed.

But then, somewhere in my heart, I was happy and excited.

Must be because I'm a Saiyan, too.

Whenever I see anyone strong, my heart leaps.

I know this is wrong, but please......give me another chance to fight him.

All right. You do have the right to ask for your own way.

It's because of you, Goku, that we still have the Earth that we do.

But you listen to me, Goku!

You take care of him next time with devastating power!

Yeah... I'll be sure to...

Remember this well, you trash.

There won't be any more miracles.

The next time we meet, I'll kill you all...

You can look forward to that.

Damn it...

Are you okay?

You can rest easy, now.

He left, eh?

I gotta wonder, why didn't that peabrain......finish the guy off?

Sorry about that, Kuririn.

Don't worry about it.

It didn't seem right doing that to everyone who died, but then again, it just might be possible to bring them back to--

H-He couldn't be...!

Hey! Hey!

Gohan-chan!

Ch-Chichi?

Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan!

Gohan-chan!

Ch-Chichi...

Gohan-chan!

Huh...?

Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan! Are you okay?

Wake up! Your ma is here!

Gohan-chan! What an awful mess you've been through!

G-Gohan is fine.

Goku is in far worse shape than he is.
You see? You see? Over there.

You poor thing, bein' forced to go through this!

You're never leavin' your ma's side again!

You poor thing! Gohan-chan! Gohan-chan!

That's just not right.
Goku had a rough time of it, too.

S-Son-kun...

--Goku...
--Son-kun...

Are you okay, Son-kun?

T-This is brutal.

S-Sorry, I let the Saiyan get away.

Oh, no, just being able to drive him off is quite an accomplishment.

Karin-sama...

C-Calling him strong doesn't begin to cover it.

B-Bulma-san... Yamucha-san and everyone else besides us four were killed...

Mm-hmm, we were watching it on  TV.

B-But with Piccolo dead, Kami-sama is also...

That's right. Which means, the Dragon Balls, as well...

I know that much!

You knew, didn't you?

Y-Yeah.

If only Piccolo were one of the ones who survived...

Well, excuse me fer livin'.

That's right! All you did was run around! You didn't fight one bit!

W-What was that, ya big--

A good-for-nothing jerk like you ought to just die right now, and take Piccolo's place, you idiot!!

If it wasn't fer me, these guys wouldn'a survived, neither!

Yer really burnin' me up!
No more Mr. Nice Guy fer me!

All right, all right!

Forget about that, we have to hurry and get the injured to a hospital.

I don't have any more senzu beans left.

Easy, easy... easy, now...

Gohan-chan...

The others' bodies are around here, right?

Um... a little farther that way.

Bulma-san, don't cry. T-The chances of this might be extremely slim......and maybe a little bit ridiculous......so listen, but don't get your hopes up.

There is a chance that those who were killed by the Saiyans can be brought back to life again.

W-What do you mean?

Really?

It's kind of a nebulous idea...

K-Kuririn, now that you mention it, you said something about that to me, too.

What do you mean by it? Tell us.

T-The truth is...

H-Hold on a minute. I'll tell you later.

Muten Roshi-sama, land here.

We have to get everyone's bodies aboard.

Mm-hmm.

Over the Star

Taking wing

like a shooting star across the sky

Watching over you from here

T-There isn't one.

He blew himself up, into little pieces.

Spanning the distance

Good grief, how awful.

Let my prayer find its way to you

I really do wish we could bring them all back to life.

You're the Star

The way things stand, their sacrifice has been too great.

You can see the blue earth, can't you?

Karin-sama, all I feel is anger......over my own powerlessness.

Calling to you, far away, from the heart transcending time

Let my prayer find its way to you
Let my prayer reach the skies

O-Okay.

Gohan-chan, are you awake?!

Relax! it's Ma! it's your ma!

M-Mother?

You poor thing! What a terrifyin' ordeal!

But you're all right now!

Yes, well done. Outstanding!

We made it through!

How? Where's the Saiyan?

He ran away. He got away from us.

B-But then, we all gave him a real thrashing, right?

He might not ever come back.

Where's Father?!

I'm in the back, Gohan.

I somehow managed to survive, thanks to you guys.

Hey, that's all fine an' all......but yer Goku's wife, right?
Quit just worryin' 'bout the kid, an' start lookin' after yer husband some.

H-How rude! No way!

It's because of Goku-sa that Gohan-chan suffered so!

There was no reason to drag my boy into this!

That's not true, Mother. Father was--

I am far more worried about Gohan-chan's future than I am worried about the Earth!

Goku, is it okay if I slug her?

Kuririn, would you tell us about what you meant earlier?

O-Oh, right. Mm-hmm.

The Saiyans seemed to know that there were Dragon Balls here on Earth, probably through Goku's brother's radio.

They also knew they granted wishes.

So, as long as they were here, they were going to obtain the Dragon Balls, too.

--Really?
--Yeah.

But when they saw Piccolo's face, they said something strange-- that he was a "Namekian."

Apparently, Piccolo was an alien.
And Kami-sama, too, I guess.

That ain't so surprisin', given his face.

The critical thing is what came next.

Nappa! kill them!

B-But what about the Dragon Balls?

No matter! I have an idea!

If we go to that Namekian's home world of Planet Namek, they're sure to have even more powerful Dragon Balls there!

Feh, that's what they said? Big whoop.

I heard them, too!

They said the Namekians had the power to create mysterious balls.

If-- and that's a really big if--we were able to go to this Planet Namek, we might be able to get our hands on those Dragon Balls.

I get it.

If you did that, those who were killed could come back to life!

Piccolo-san could come back to life!

G-Gohan-chan! How can you say that?!

Exactly! If Piccolo came back to life, so would Kami-sama!

Which would also mean the Dragon Balls here could come back!

--Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!...
--T-That's amazing! T-Then maybe, possibly, this could work!

Couldn't it? Couldn't it? Couldn't it?

Things are so simple to you laymen, huh?

There's no way we could achieve such a pipe dream.

What a bummer.

Not even you can do it, Bulma-san?

For one thing, Kuririn, how are we going to find out where this whatever-it's-called planet is?

L-Leave that to me.

Kaio-sama, you heard, right?

Do you know where this Planet Namek is?

Planet Namek? Of course I know where it is.

Whatever else anyone says, I am Kaio, after all.

T-This is incredible! We can all hear him, too!

S-So this is Kaio-sama, is it?

Kaio-sama, it sounds like everyone else can hear you, too.

Tell us where it is.

Hmm, Planet Namek's location...The way you folks on Earth would put it... let's see...Bearing SW by... no, er......let's see here... bearing SU ......by, let's see, YX, is it?

... YX, you say?!

B-Bulma-san, did you understand that just now?

H-Hey, Kame-chan, take over.
I have to calculate something.

K-Kame-chan?

The thing is, Planet Namek was once an extremely beautiful world, but as I recall, a good while back, they had an awful climatic aberration, and I thought that all of the Namekians died out.

Then that does it. Ain't no way there's any Dragon Balls.

H-Hey, you!

Now, don't panic. Once I check up on Planet Namek, I'll know for sure.

Where was it, again? Let's see now...

Oh, this way?

It makes sense. So Kami-- I mean, the Namekian who would become Kami-- escaped there and came to Earth.

The fact that Kami himself forgot about it means that he either lost his memory, or that he was just a little child at the time.

Either way, he had a sad past.

Even so, the Dragon Balls can grant any wish, right?

So the guys that made 'em coulda just said, "Stop this abnormal climate," couldn't they?

That probably wouldn't have worked.

Shen Long said that he couldn't grant any wish that was greater than the power of the one who created the Dragon Balls.

That means he couldn't rein in such terrific power.

That's why even Shen Long couldn't do anything about the Saiyans.

Oh, ya don't say. The Dragon Balls ain't all that great, then.

You've got a smart mouth!

Oh, there they are!

There are Namekians! There are no more than a hundred of them, but they survived, and are flourishing again!

There're a hundred of them guys?!

Not to worry. By nature, Namekians are a very gentle race.

Just like the guy that used to be Kami on your planet.

What became Piccolo Daimao was probably brought about by the influence of the evil in earthlings he encountered before he became Kami.

Yeah, that tracks.

There're some pretty small-minded folks out there in the world.

Look who's talking.

Still, this means there's a chance that Kami, not to mention Yamucha and Tenshinhan, can come back to life!

--Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
--Naive! You guys are so naive!

Sure, we may know where this Planet Namek place is. However, how are you thinking of getting there?

How? Well, in a spaceship, of course.

And I'm telling you, that's where you're being downright naive!

I just calculated the time it would take for a spaceship, using the world's best engine, built by my dad, to arrive at Planet Namek, just to see what it was.

A real whopper of a number came back. See?

347, years and three months.
We'll have to live an awfully long time.

As far as that goes, I think we'll be all right.

I was thinking of using the spaceship that Saiyan came in.

I got a look at Vegeta's spaceship, and it was so small, any way you look at it, it's a one-seater.

Which means that the other, dead Saiyan's spaceship has to still be out there somewhere.

Y-Yeah! The spaceship my older brother rode here in, too!

Ah, come to think of it, that one got smashed up by Gohan.

Even so, there's still one of them, right?

Once I find that one and analyze it, I might be able to manage something.

It's probably somewhere around Metro East.

That was the first area destroyed by the Saiyans.

We'll have to go look for it later.

That's what I was thinking, and picked up a neat little item.

This. I know I saw Vegeta beep this and call his spaceship in.
I'm sure it's a remote control!

This could work! This could really work!

All right! All right! Hope is in sight!

Planet Namek or bust!

Yeah, right!


The Spaceship that Sleeps in Yunzabit! Blast Off for Planet Namek"
  

"Son Goku"
"Son Gohan"

Man, we sure were lucky, huh?

They say that Gohan and I need to stay here for three days, and then we'll be good as new.

Ooh, you've got me beat.

They told me it would take four months for my injuries to heal.

They also said I might not ever be back to normal again.

Hey, you've got nothing to worry about.

In another month or so, some new senzu beans will be ready.

You know, you look just like a mummy.

And after the punishin' I took, they ain't even admittin' me.

Yeah, when Yajirobe was about to get pounded by that Saiyan, he was all like, "I'm sorry!

I really respect you! Let's be friends!"

Why, you! I'll knock yer block off!

I just did that to get him off guard!

Anyway, you all really did good.

Nothin' could make me happier.

Plus, it looks like the ones who died will be comin' back to life.

Hey, guys, guys, the  TV! Look at the  TV!

Oh, it's you, Bulma.

I thought you might have been a funny-looking nurse.

You just hush! Here, watch the TV.

This object, which was discovered in the devastation of Metro East, appears to be a vehicle from space, though that cannot be confirmed.

That's it! That's the Saiyan's!

--I know, right?
--I-I can't see!

Reports are that at the time of the discovery of this object, there were apparently two of them, but one of them suddenly flew away from the site.

This isn't good. Those scientists have already carried it away.

This will be fun, won't it?

Let's use the remote control that Kuririn brought along and call that thing over here.

I'm sure it will surprise them.

Are you sure that's a good idea?

What are you talking about? I'm a genius.

I spent last night examining this thing. Watch this!

Okay, beep, beep, beep...

Ready? Here it goes...

I wanna see, too!

T-The object has suddenly exploded!
What could have happened?

There is wreckage from the object scattered all over the place!

W-Why?

Could that have been the self-destruct button?!

What do we do?! Without that spaceship, we can't go to Planet Namek!

Our last hope......completely wiped out.

It's hopeless now.

This is what happens when you find strange remote controls!

Bulma-san, you're the one who pushed the buttons indiscriminately.

Hey.

Hi.

Mister Popo!

Somebody come with me. There is spaceship.

A spaceship? For real, Popo-san?

Probably.

W-Who is that?

That's Mister Popo.

Mister Popo?

He stays with Kami-sama up at his place.

But he's been up there at Kami's palace much, much longer than the current Kami-sama.

Say, what do you mean, "probably"?

It probably......spaceship. But Mister Popo not quite sure.

Somebody come along, examine it.
Mister Popo lead way.

Bulma-san!

Me?!

Well, Bulma-san, nobody else here knows anything about spaceships.

Bulma-san?

A-Are you sure this guy is all right?

Isn't there something dodgy about his eyes?

E-Easy...

We're counting on you, Bulma.

Be careful with me as we go, now.

Okay, we go.

Gently... gently, now...

Here we are.

Huh? Already?

Get off.

Where is this place? it's pretty cold here.

Yunzabit Highlands.

Yunzabit?!

That's the other side of the Earth, you know!

We came all the way here in that one instant?

Where was it...?

This way?

J-Just a minute!

Hey, you mean there's something like a spaceship around here?

Hey, are you listening to me?

You haven't brought me to this godforsaken place in order to do something pervy with me, right?

--H-Hey!
--Come quick.

Y-You're kidding, right? I can't do that--

Geez...

This.

Is this spaceship?

I'll have to look closer.

W-What is this? it's not metal. Is this...

Hey, what's going on here?
Tell me what on earth this thing is.

About years ago, Kami-sama told Mister Popo about past.

When Kami-sama was child, lived here in Yunzabit.

Mister Popo asked him, "Yunzabit is remote land. Nobody live there.

Why you live in that place?"

I don't know why I was in that place.

Apparently, I bumped my head, and all of my memories up until then were lost.

Had no parents?

No, I didn't. The only thing I had was a letter that said,

"Wait here, we'll come later."

What does that mean?
I don't see where this is going.

When Kami-sama was child, waited long time for parents.

My house was right there, in Yunzabit.

I believed that my parents would surely come back for me.

But no matter how long I waited, nobody ever came.

I wonder how long I must have waited.

30 years? Oh, no, perhaps 10.

I finally gave up, left my house behind, and departed Yunzabit.

I would go back once in a while to look in on it, but nothing ever changed.

So listen, what does any of that have to do with this?

You impatient. Now getting to point.

Though, you know, thinking back on it now, it was an odd house.

I didn't realize it until I learned more about the world, but that house was really unusual.

It was round, with four legs attached to it, almost like some sort of bug.

The door didn't have any knobs or locks, but would open when you spoke to it.

"Piccolo."

P--?

An entrance...

Get on top of here.

This is Kami-sama's house?

Say again, and it closes.

"Piccolo."

Look closely. This not house, but spaceship, yes?

That's right! Kami-sama is a Namekian!

That Kaio person did say that long ago, Planet Namek was nearly wiped out by abnormal climate, or whatnot.

Mister Popo also heard Kaio-sama speak.

Thought "what if," came here, and found this.

It's true, if this really is a spaceship, it would all make sense.

When Planet Namek had crisis, Kami-sama's parents put child Kami-sama aboard, and sent to Earth.

His parents planned to escape afterward, but there was some accident...

Yeah! I mean, any way you look at it, this doesn't seem like a house.

I-It must be... a spaceship!

But even if that's the case, can we use it?

The entrance worked, so it must have some power.

Is this the main switch? No. Let's see, this...

That's not right, either.

That's strange. I wonder if there's a code number or something.

It doesn't look like this operates using buttons.

I don't get it.

I wonder if this is some kind of sensor.

Voice?

Yeah! it uses words, like the entrance did!

What to say? "Piccolo"?

No. After all, that was the word for going in or out.

Move, you hear me? Fly! Let me see you fly!

That won't work. The language is different.

You have to speak Namekian.

I mean, back when Son-kun fought against Piccolo, I heard him speaking in some weird language.

That must be Namekian.

If that Namekian, Mister Popo knows it.

--Really?!
--Really.

Word "Piccolo" means "other world" in that language.

So, is word for entrance.

Why didn't you say so sooner?

So Piccolo Daimao is the "Demon King of Another World."

Here, try telling it to fly.

Fly to where?

Anywhere is fine.

I know, how about the Jupiter area?

Topul kuppa koloppungo.

I-Incredible! it's Jupiter!
This is an incredible spaceship!

Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

Thank goodness.
Now Kami-sama sure to come back.

The spaceship is perfect!

That ship can get to Planet Namek in just one month!

I just have to convert the inside a little bit, and......hmm, yeah, it can launch in another five days.

To Planet Namek in Kami-sama's spaceship, huh?

That faint bit of light is about to come true.

With that being said, Popo-san, we're counting on you to go to Planet Namek.

Eh? Mister Popo cannot go.

Mister Popo cannot go.

Would be away from Kami-sama's palace for two months. Cannot do.

Come on! After all, you're the only one who can speak Namekian!

You seem pretty tough, too.

Popo-san, you're the only one we can ask to go.

No worry. Will teach you Namekian.

Then, Bulma-san, you'll have to go.

If anything were to happen, Bulma-san, you're the only one familiar with mechanical stuff.

Fine. it doesn't seem particularly dangerous.

But I'm not going there by myself, understand? Someone come with me.

I'm tellin' ya right now, no way in hell am I goin'.

--We wouldn't expect it of you.
--Son-kun is all laid up.

--What?!
--Kuririn, you'll come with me, right?

M-Me? I don't really mind.

Sounds nice. I wish I could go, too.

I want to see what kind of Shen Long would appear in Planet Namek.

Now, Goku, you take it easy, and come up with some countermeasure against the Saiyan.

Right. it's up to you two.

U-Um...

P-Please take me with you, too!

G-Gohan-chan, what sort of cockamamie jokes are you tellin'?

It isn't a joke! I-I really do want to go.

D-Don't be ridiculous. Another two months, on top of all this?

I'm sorry. I want to go, for all the world.

I want to bring Piccolo-san back to life with my own hands.

What kind of nonsense are you talkin' about?!

Sheesh, you haven't even healed all the way yet!

Physically, I'm all right.

W-What are you doin'?!

S-Stop that, Gohan-chan!

Please, take me with you.

I-I forbid anythin' of the kind!
I absolutely forbid it! Two months!

What about your cram school, and your lessons?!

Piccolo doesn't have anythin' to do with this!

You are a little boy! And boys should behave like boys!

Shut up!

G-Gohan-chan has turned into a d-delinquent...

M-Mother, right now...

Right now really isn't the time to talk about that.

We have to bring back to life the people who fought so desperately, and died while trying to defend the Earth, and fight back against the Saiyans once again.

I can... I can fight, too.

I have to... l have to do something.

Understand, Mother. I'm sorry.

He's got you beat, Chichi.

Let Gohan go off into space, with your blessin'.

Gohan, attaboy. You really have gotten stronger.

It'll be fine. No problem at all. Just leave it to us.

There won't be any danger this time around.

Can you learn Namekian in five days?

Let's see. I'll have to input it all into a translator, so I'll need ten days.

All right, see you in ten days, at the Kame House!

Right!

And so, in the blink of an eye, ten days pass, and the day of the launch arrives.

Whew, is this thing really going to get us to Planet Namek?

Quite a snappy little outfit there, Kuririn.

You're not, by any chance, making light of outer space, are you?

I even cut my hair, since it would be in the way inside my spacesuit!

Is that really you, Gohan?!
What happened to your hair?!

F-Father laughed at me, too.

Say what you will, this is the first time mankind is goin' out into space.

Can't have him bein' unmannerly.

We're counting on you. You be sure you find those Dragon Balls, now.

Right.

"Piccolo."

Grandpa, Mother, Mr. Turtle Hermit, and Mr. Turtle, we're off! Take care.

"Piccolo."

Be sure you eat regularly.

Send me a letter, every day.

Bye, now.

It's a little bit exciting, huh?

Say, Bulma-san, where should we put our bags?

Just put them any old place!
Hurry up and sit down!

She's in a bad mood about something.

Blast off in five seconds.
Destination, Planet Namek.

J-J-Just a minute!

5.. 4...

3... 2...

B-B-Bulma-san! W-W-We haven't f-f-fastened our belts y-y-yet!

That is incredible speed, to be sure.
They're out of sight already.

Gohan-chan! Don't forget to rinse!

Hmph, you're free to move around, now.

Now that we're out of the atmosphere, things will be calm.

Already?

Huh? What are you doing, Bulma-san?

What a pest! I'm going to change my clothes!

Change your clothes? You mean, into pajamas?

Uh-oh. Come to think of it, I forgot my pajamas.

--What about you, Gohan?
--I made sure to bring mine.

Not that it's any of my business,

but could you do something about that Shichigosan outfit?

This is just for the launch.

Actually, I made some clothes, and kept it a secret from Mother.

Well?

You really do respect Piccolo, don't you?

Yes, about the same as Father.

Those are unusual pajamas, huh?

They look uncomfortable to sleep in.

These aren't pajamas, you know. 
Looking at you two, I felt like a fool for being so fired up in getting ready for space.

H-Hey, have we done something wrong?

Beats me.


A Formidable New Enemy! Emperor of the Universe, Freeza"
  

Ugh, I am bored to death.

Good grief, this is only the seventh day.

There are still twenty-some more days to go.

I should have built a hibernation device or something.

Are you guys doing your image training again?

That's nice for you. You can pass the time.

Whew, not bad! You sure are strong.

After all, you've inherited Goku's blood, and had Piccolo train you.

Still, I'm surprised at how many techniques you have, Kuririn-san.

Say......it's up to you whether you train inside your heads, but the room is starting to get pretty messy, so would you mind tidying it up?

There is a lady present.

But Bulma-san, you're the one who made that mess.

We've cleaned up our own stuff.

I am busy. I have a lot of things I have to think about, too.

You guys are just riding along, so that's fine for you.

A moment ago, you said you were bored.

You hush. I wish you could be nicer to a delicate lady.

Ah, I'm so busy, I'm so busy...

if she's such a lady, I wish she wouldn't parade around in her underwear.

Say...

So anyway, I've been wondering about this for a while, but when that Saiyan Vegeta fled, where did he flee to?

Where, you ask?

I mean, the Saiyan's world has been gone for a long time, right?

Oh, yeah. In any event, he had taken some serious damage, so I'd think it would be somewhere with a civilization.

Do you suppose there's anyplace like that?

That brother of Son-kun's said something earlier, remember?

"We exterminate the people who live on planets that have good environments, and then sell them to aliens."

I wonder if Vegeta went to one of those alien folks, and is having them treat him.

If so, then whenever he comes to Earth again would depend on where that planet is.

If it's far away, that will buy us some time. 

I have to say,

Earth has attracted the attention of one heck of a bad guy.

T-To think that something like this would happen...

It has been days since Vegeta left Earth.

All right, here!

Something's coming!

Is it Freeza-sama?

It couldn't be. He just barely departed.

It's a round pod. That's a combatant.

The signal belongs to Vegeta-sama!

That's strange. We've received no word that he was returning.

Could something have happened?

Hey this is the flight control room!

Vegeta-sama is about to arrive!
Fall out to greet him at once!

He's here!

It's just one craft, all right! Where is Nappa-san?

I-Is something the matter? He's not coming out.

Hey, his life sign readings are awfully low.

What?

He's using his life support equipment!

This is bad! Hurry and carry him to the treatment room!

There.

You are healed. You may open your eyes.

Unfortunately, I was unable to regrow your tail.

No matter. it will grow back in due time.

Vegeta-sama, as mighty as you are, you were put to quite a bit of trouble, weren't you?

If this superstrong rubber protector was left in tatters, you were lucky to return to us in one piece.

It would take quite a bit for this to end up like this.

What in the world happened on this planet Earth?

Is Freeza-sama around?

N-No, he has departed.

He's already tired of this planet, is he?

U-Um, Kewie-sama said that......once your treatment was completed, he needed to speak to you, and to report to the Training Room.

Hmph, you tell him that I said, unfortunately, I don't have anything to talk to him about.

B-But...

Vegeta-sama, um, you forgot your Scouter.

I don't need it. You can have it.

I'll head for Earth first thing in the morning.

This time, I'll blow them to smithereens for sure.

No, before that, I'll go to Planet Namek...

Yo, Vegeta! Word is you got your butt kicked.

I hear Raditz and Nappa are dead, too.

Who was it that caused the supposedly invincible Saiyans such agony?

Get lost, Kewie. I don't have time to listen to your worthless drivel.

Now, just listen.

Freeza-sama is upset with you, going off by yourselves like that.

If he's not here, he can't gripe about it.

Now, remove that filthy hand of yours.

Still, Freeza-sama is a magnanimous person.

He seems willing to forgive you, since you discovered something quite sensational.

What?

He was thrilled that he might be able to gain eternal life and youth.

Say what?! Then, you mean Freeza-sama departed for...

Hmph, Planet Namek.

Damn! He was listening in to what we were saying on the Scouters?!

I have to beat him to it, or I'll be that bastard's puppet forever!

You apparently wanted to use the Dragon Balls to get eternal life, but you'll have to give up on that now.

Once Freeza-sama has his wish granted, he plans to exterminate the Namekians.

That bastard!

Hey, Vegeta!

V-Vegeta-sama!

Give me that!

I'm going to need it after all!

Vegeta!

I won't let you do it! They belong to me!

Not again.

Four more.

Geez, Son-san, you can't do this.

Miss Nurse, I'm all right now.

Goku, you see, is immortal.

Oh, did I just do something?

It must be my age. Lately, my mind has been slipping...

Oh, for the love of...

These sponge cakes are delicious.

Ahem!

Doctor!

How many times must I tell you?

If you keep this up, you'll never be discharged.

But as you can see, I'm...

I'm sure that hurts. You have been quite seriously injured, after all.

Now get back to bed.

S-Sorry.

Come on, Grandpa Glad-hands, help him up.

G-Grandpa Glad-hands?

Grandpa Glad-hands, am I?

My word...

"Grandpa Glad-hands."

Where is his wife, who was looking after him?

Oh, she must have gone up to the roof again, to look up into the sky.

I wonder if Gohan-chan is doin' okay.

And after all my insistin' that he send me a letter every day, I haven't gotten a single one.

Come back to me soon, safe and sound. 

30 days after leaving Earth, Bulma and the others at last reach their destination of Planet Namek.

We made it! There it is!

Wow! it sure is pretty!

That world is Planet Namek, huh?

No doubt about it!

The computer vouches that this is the bona fide Planet Namek!

We got here just about right on schedule, didn't we?

That's Kami-sama's spaceship for you!

That was smooth sailing, all right!

Sure was! Now, sit down and fasten your seatbelts so we can land.

There's going to be a pretty hard jolt.

Right!

Begin landing procedures for any suitable location.

We made it! We landed on Planet Namek!

We're here!

Hang on. I'm going to check the atmospheric components now.

I made sure to install some sensors. Aren't I prepared?

We'll be lucky if there's a certain amount of oxygen.

I did prepare some atmospheric masks, but our time would be limited, and I don't know how much help--

This is a lot like the place where Piccolo-san trained me.

Yeah, that place where we fought the Saiyans first, right?

I guess he'd instinctively feel more at ease in a place like his home.

Piccolo-san...

You guys don't have the least bit of common sense, do you?!

How can you just stroll on out here?!

You're as scary as ever...

For crying out loud. Well, as long as there are Dragon Balls here...

Please!

Look! I'm reading them!

Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

K-Kuririn-san, I feel some strong Ki over there.

Ki?

You're right.

I'm feeling a lot of them.

Yeah. And what's more, they're all really powerful Ki.

W-What does that mean?

Oh, you guys. What are you talking about?

Those are Namekians.

As strong as Kami-sama and Piccolo were, it's not at all surprising that the Namekians at home would have powerful Ki, too.

--But...
--These Ki feel a little bit evil, don't they?

It's all right, I tell you.

Kaio-sama said that Namekians are peaceful by nature, didn't he?

Over in that direction, there are four Dragon Balls gathered together.

Now, let's go and meet the Namekians!

Yeah... You're right. They must be Namekians!

I feel silly for being scared.

Haven't we seen that before somewhere?

It's a Saiyan spaceship!

I knew it!

--It can't be!
--Oh, no, for real? Why?!

Gohan, mask your presence! We'll be detected!

R-Right!

I-It's Vegeta. it couldn't be anyone else.

D-Damn it!

He's already recovered from his injuries?

Come to think of it, he knows about the Dragon Balls, too.

W-What do we do? it's hopeless now!

All we can do is go back to Earth, right?
Am I right? Let's hurry back!

If that guy gets his hands on the Dragon Balls, it's all over.

Bulma-san, please contact Earth, tell them about this, and then return there by yourself.

Gohan and I will stay here, and try to collect the Dragon Balls.

But...

it's all right. We'll have the Dragon Radar.

--Right, Gohan?
--Right!

Okay.

Once I get back to Earth, I'll bring Son-kun aboard, and come right back.

The round trip will take a little over two months.

Sit tight, okay?

It'll be fine! Two months will go by like that!

It's just 30 days! That's only 7,200 hours, 426,000 minutes, or 52,260,000 seconds!

Right?

Right, a little over two months.

Freeza, you bastard.

You're trying to grab them away from me, but I won't let you.

I should be able to handle everyone besides Freeza, but I don't stand a chance fighting him head-on.

I have to steal the Dragon Balls and gain eternal life, no matter what.

Tch! To think that I would wind up using a Scouter again...

This way, huh?

He brought Zarbon and Dodoria with him.

W-What did you say?!

A-And then?

Yeah. So tell Son-kun and the others.

Do you hear me? Just don't tell Chichi-san. Got it?

Yeah... Yeah... Like I said...

No! it's not like that! Sheesh!

Right! You got it? I'm counting on you. Bye, now.

For Pete's sake...

What's the matter, you two?

Huh? What?

W-W-Why is that thing coming here again?!

T-That's what I'd like to know.

I found it, Freeza-sama.

Oh, good, good.

Now there are three of them left.


Rebellion Against Freeza! Vegeta, Burning with Ambition"

 
Now there are three of them left.

Hold on to those carefully, Dodoria-san.

It appears that Vegeta is after them, as well.

Freeza-sama, Kewie has just landed, in pursuit of Vegeta.

Also, the two large power readings that appeared shortly before Vegeta arrived suddenly disappeared, and remain so.

Our men are searching the area where the readings came from, so we should find out their source momentarily.

Well, the problem is how to deal with Vegeta, who has turned against me.

In that case, you need not worry.

Kewie is on his way to dispose of Vegeta.

The two of them have always hated each other, and their abilities are just about evenly matched.

Whatever happens, Vegeta will not come out unharmed.

Vegeta, you won't get away!

I found you, Vegeta. I have orders from Freeza-sama.

Do you read me, Vegeta? Now I can kill you, without any reservations!

Don't make me laugh, Kewie. 
Do you really think you can kill me?

Hurry up and get here. I'm waiting for you.

What are you, blind? Take a good look at your Scouter!

My battle power is clearly higher than yours!

In any event, we can't just stay here, huh?

I'll let you guys take care of getting the Dragon Balls.

Okay, I'm going back to Earth, so good luck.

Kuririn-san, someone is coming!

The readings vanished right around here.

Probably a Namekian.

Who is it?

It's probably a Namekian.

That's not a Namekian!

W-Who's that?

T-They're not Namekians. Who are they?

It doesn't really matter.

We've got orders to kill everyone on this planet.

Look at their outfits!

They're just like what the Saiyans were wearing.

But they aren't Saiyans!

I don't know what any of this means, but I've got a bad feeling.

Y-Yeah. Any way you look at it, those are not the sort of faces that say "let's be friends."

Gohan, build up your Ki, but keep your presence masked.

R-Right.

You see that? Their battle power is pretty much trash.

Are these guys just tourists?

We won't have any fun if they get away from us.

Take out their spaceship first.

All right.

Oh, no! The spaceship!

These guys are unlucky to have come here at a time like this.

Gohan, release your Ki. 
These guys aren't all that tough.

Mm-hmm.

Hey, did you hear that?

Not that tough? Does he mean us?

W-What's with these battle power ratings?!

--Let's get them!
--Right!

Hey, nice, nice!

That was not nice!

What do we do about that?

Is something the matter, Zarbon-san?

Yes, Freeza-sama. it concerns the scouts that were sent out earlier.

Apparently, these guys are not your average people.

For a moment, their battle powers rose, and then, after defeating our two scouts, their readings disappeared again.

Ho, that is unusual. it doesn't appear to be Vegeta, either.

No, Vegeta's reading is separate.

Both of these battle powers were around 1,500.

1,500, you say? Nothing would come of it if we left them alone, but their attitude seems poor.

The next time they appear, eliminate them.

It's hopeless! it's all over!
I'll never get back to Earth again!

Bulma-san, for now, let's get away from this place.

There could be trouble.
Someone stronger might be coming.

He's right. Those many Ki that we sensed are apparently not Namekians, but friends of Vegeta, so we have to find someplace to hide.

We'll manage something.

I'm sure the Namekians will fix the spaceship.

How nice that you're so optimistic.

Bulma-san...

Hmph, you're finally here......you moron.

The time is finally here, when we can settle the score, as rivals.

However, you've lost your touch.

With that battle power, you have no chance of beating me.

As rivals, you say?

Well, let me show you something.

When I was on Earth, I picked up something interesting from them.

What, how to run away quickly?

How to control my battle power.

How to control your battle power?

Take a good look at my battle power rating on your Scouter!

I-Impossible! Our battle powers have always been evenly matched!

You imbecile! I have been constantly engaged in actual combat!

The fight I had on Earth nearly killed me.

Did you think I would remain evenly matched with you, with you staying all curled up next to Freeza?!

17,000 ... 19,000 ... 21,000 ... 22,000 ...!

What happened, Zarbon?

I-I think it was a malfunction, but the Scouter I had set to Vegeta had a rating of around 22,000.

"22,000? That really must have been a malfunction."

Your Scouter is an older model, after all.

I'll get the correct reading with mine.

What's the rating?

T-That's impossible! Is my newer model malfunctioning, too?

It's risen to 24,000 !

24,000? Are you saying that his battle power is higher than ours?

I-It can't be. His battle power topped out at 18,000.

There is no reason to be surprised.

Vegeta has been fighting at the forefront, after all.

He must have come across some trick while he was on Earth.

But sir...

it is only 24,000. At that level, if you fight him together, it will be enough to beat him, will it not?

W-Wait, Vegeta! I just had an idea!
Let me team up with you!

I-I'll help you! I've never been fond of Freeza-sama-- I mean, Freeza!

N-Not a bad idea, right? W-With your battle power, if we teamed up,

I think we could handle Zarbon and Dodoria!

Just keep spouting your worthless lies!

You are one thoroughly sickening bastard!

Believe me, Vegeta!

Ah! Freeza-sama!

What?!

You fool!

I don't care how much your battle power has risen, if you took that unawares, you don't stand a chance!

You wish.

That was a perfectly pathetic strategy, coming from someone like you.

I'm stunned.

W-When did you...?

If my battle power has risen, it means my speed has risen, too!

Which means, you've completely enraged me with that move!

Die!

What a messy firework.

V-Vegeta's rating of 24,000 was genuine after all.

He defeated Kewie like it was nothing.

It is no great concern.

Now, to look for the fifth Dragon Ball.

Thanks to their Scouters, they'll know what action I've taken.

Even if I'm careless enough to get close to them, though I may be able to take Zarbon or Dodoria, not even I could beat Freeza.

Judging by the transmissions from Freeza's men that I heard on my Scouter, the Dragon Balls don't have any effect unless you have all seven of them together. All right.

I'll find just one of them.
Once they've gathered the other six, I'll find an opening to steal them.

If it goes right, I'll have them all, and gain eternal life.

Then defeating Freeza will be more than just a dream.

I am reading ten or so Namekians in that direction.

Very well. it sure would be nice if they have the fifth Dragon Ball.

Please be sure not to let your guard down.

After all, it appears that there are some other curious fellows out there beside Vegeta.

--Yes, sir.
--Now, let us be going.

Once he's out of the way, I'll be Number One.

I, the Saiyan, Vegeta, will rule the entire universe!

Bulma-san, we have to hurry it up a little more.

We'll be spotted out here.

You guys can fly, right? Then take me and fly.

We'd like to do so, but we have to walk to mask our presence.

Bulma-san, up there is a good place.

It will be hard to spot us inside that cave.

How long am I going to have to live in a place like that?

Kuririn-san...

Do you sense any Ki over there?

You're right. These Ki feel different from those others earlier.

They could really be Namekians this time.

Hide! There are some other Ki coming this way from over there!

--What, now?
--Come on, hurry!

What in the world is going on?!

They're coming this way.

Do you think they know about us?

I don't know.

They're here!

T-They're gone. Thank goodness.

Apparently, we weren't what they were after. But then, what exactly was that just now?

What's the matter, you two?

B-Bulma-san, would you confirm something with the Dragon Radar?

W-What?

When you checked earlier, there were four Dragon Balls gathered together, right?

Would you see where they are now?

All right, I'll look.

All four of them are moving! Which means...

Yeah, no doubt about it!

Those guys just now were carrying the four Dragon Balls!

T-They were?

I knew it.

Gohan...

Gohan!

--Yes?
--Gohan, did you see him?

The strange one who was flying second from the front?

Yes.

I sensed a tremendous power from him.

T-The moment I saw him, I was petrified.

H-He could be much, much worse than even Vegeta.

I-It looked like there were some other heavy hitters there, but he, for one, is in a league of his own.

Worse than Vegeta? Oh, no. Who was he?

I-I don't know, but I think they were Vegeta's friends.

They all had on the same sort of clothing.

Damn it, how are we supposed to get the Dragon Balls away from those guys?!

Say, look here.

That group is headed toward another Dragon Ball.

What's going on? Do they have a Radar, too?

What location is it?

About 50 kilometers in this direction.

Kuririn-san, that's the place where we sensed Ki that you said could be Namekians.

I'm going to go there and see what's happening.

I'm going, too!

J-Just a minute!

Are you going to leave me here, all by myself?

It's far safer for you to stay here than it is to fumble your way around.

When you put it that way, you're right.

Okay, we're off.

Hurry back, okay?

Remember, Gohan, hurry, but suppress your Ki as much as you can.

--Can you do that?
--Yes!

All right!

There they go. I wonder if they're really all right.

Oh yeah, I have to contact Earth.

Really?

So then, are Gohan and the others okay?

Yeah. They did in fact arrive safely on Planet Namek.

But Gohan and the others aren't the only ones who went to Namek.

That Saiyan named Vegeta is also there.

Vegeta?! He's there?!

And that's not all. In addition to Vegeta, there are a over a dozen of his friends on Planet Namek.

The spaceship they rode there in was blasted by them, and they can't get back to Earth now.

W-What?!

What's more, they said that at least one of them had a Ki that was greater than Vegeta's.

It can't be! A Ki greater than Vegeta's?
There's a guy like that?

Yo, you still alive?

What?! Here I come all this way to see ya, why the long face?

The senzu beans're finally ready. 
Just a few of 'em, though.

Karin-sama said to take all seven of the senzu beans that're ready.

Wow, all right! That's what I call good timing!

Hurry up and give me one!

S-See here! You mustn't give strange foods to patients!

Here ya go.

I've been waiting for this moment!

Here it is! Kaio-sama sent this new gi to me, just for this day!

All right, I'm off to Planet Namek now!

Oh, thanks, I'll take the remaining senzu beans with me.

Planet Namek? How are you planning to get there?

When Bulma's daddy came to visit me, I made sure to ask him to build me a spaceship, just in case.

A spaceship? You mean like Kami-sama's?

That was made from stuff that ain't from Earth, so not even Bulma's daddy could pull that off.

S-So then...?

I thought about it hard, and realized that there are two other Saiyan spaceships on Earth.

The spaceship my brother came here in, and the spaceship that I came to Earth in when I was a kid.

O-Oh, right!

I had Bulma's daddy go look for it.

My brother's blew up with that other one, but mine was from way back, so it ended up unharmed.

I'm having him repair and reconstruct it.

Kinto Un!

Okay, I'm gonna go save them.

Mm-hmm.

Take me to Bulma's house!

He's going to save them? From what?

As it turns out...if things're as hairy as all that, why'd that bastard look so happy?

It must be his Saiyan blood, I'd say.

It goes without saying that he wants to save everyone, but more than anything, he seems to get a huge thrill from fighting someone strong.

That guy ain't normal, all right.
I can't keep up with him.

Unbelievable. To think that there's someone out there even stronger than Vegeta!


Protect the Dragon Balls! The Namekian Offensive" 
  

Ah, Goku-chan!

Bulma's mommy.

My, my, are you all better already?

Just like you see.

By the way, is the refit on the spaceship I ordered done yet?

Well, I'm not sure. it looked like he was still working on something.

Eep! Still?! Geez, what to do?

He's in the inner yard. Come along.

I have to say, who would have thought that little Goku-chan would grow up to be so handsome?

Say, let's have a date sometime, okay? Okay?

I-I have to defeat the Saiyan, first.

Aren't you the busy one?

Oh, right, I found the most delicious cake shop a little while ago.

All thanks to you, Goku-chan.

If the Earth had been gone, I wouldn't have been able to have any.

I guess not.

Dear! Goku-chan is here!

I-Is that......my spaceship?

It's huge!

Hey there, Goku. Better already?

Mm-hmm, thanks to a senzu bean.

This is mine, right? Is it true you ain't finished with it yet?

Mm-hmm, it's almost ready. 
Come on inside and have a look.

Well, I'll bring you something to drink, okay?

Thanks.

Awesome! I'm surprised that tiny spaceship became all this!

What can I say?
Everything is made to your order.

I'll be able to do some decent training like this.

I worked hard on this. Finding the spaceship was hard enough, but it was all broken up in pieces.

Luckily, all the important parts remained, but I had to rebuild almost all of it.

My spaceship was in pieces?

That's strange. I wonder if I busted it when I was a kid.

Well, I have to admit, Saiyan science is absolutely fantastic.

Huh? Um, where's the artificial gravity device?

This is it over here.

Oh, yeah? This thing?

Let's see, this here is the switch.

This here is the controller.

It can put out a maximum of 100 Gs, just like you ordered, but that would be crazy, even for you, wouldn't it?

At 100 Gs, if you weigh 30 kg, that would make you 6,000 kg!

That's six tons. Ordinarily, that would kill you.

That's okay. Unless I train someplace like that, I ain't gonna beat the Saiyan.

So, can't this thing fly yet?

Oh, it will fly. To the ends of the universe.

Huh? Then...

The bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom are down that ladder.

So then, what part of it ain't done yet?

I can't quite settle on the location for the stereo speakers.

As long as you're listening, you'll want it to sound good, right?

T-That's all?!

When you say it ain't done yet, that's all that's left?!

That's all? In order to hear top sound, you have to think about reverberation and such. it's quite tricky.

Never mind about where to put the stereo!

I'm in a hurry, so I need to take off right now!

What are you in such a rush for?

I got a message from Bulma!
In any event, I have to hurry!

Hurry up and show me how to fly this thing!

All right. So, you're sure about the stereo placement, then?

All the data has been inputted already.

All you have to do is give the button a little bop-bop, and you'll arrive at Planet Namek in six days.

Six days? I can get there in just six days? That's awesome!

Is it true? Goku is here?

Yes. He's looking at the spaceship in the inner yard now.

Oh, my!

Oh, my goodness!

Let's see, it's this button next, right?

Considering how hastily I put that together, it really did fly.

Huh? Where's Goku?

He left in a big hurry.

I hope he's sure about the stereo.

Wow, this thing sure is fast, all right.

I have to start training, right away.

I'm glad I'll get there in six days, but I've gotta surpass that Vegeta guy before then.

Let's see, if I remember right, Kaio-sama said his planet was 10-times gravity.

Maybe I should get accustomed to 20-times, to start out with.

That's kicking in, all right.

We're close. We are close.
Surpress your Ki completely now.

We'll walk up and approach from here.

Right.

They're on the other side of that cliff.

That Ki is incredible!

Those houses are just like the spaceship we came here in.

What are they up to?

The other guys are one thing, but those three--especially the one in the middle, inside that round vehicle--have a frighteningly strong Ki.

I-I can tell.

Look at what the two guys on his side are holding in their hands!

Those are Dragon Balls!

Gigantic Dragon Balls!

Is something the matter, Dodoria-san?

No, there was just a small power reading up on that cliff.

It is gone now. it must have been a small animal, or an insect.

Holy crap! We were this close to being spotted!

Freeza-sama, we have only found five of them.

The others appear to be out at the moment.

Come on out of there, unless you'd rather die.

That looks just like Piccolo-san!

I-It's a Namekian!

What are they planning to do with the Namekian?

Kuririn-san, are they all Saiyans?

No, they aren't. They all have the same battlewear on, but they aren't Saiyans. For one thing,

Vegeta is supposed to be the only Saiyan remaining.

Not counting Goku or yourself.

T-Then...

Come to think of it, Goku's older brother mentioned something.

Our job is to travel around the universe, looking for planets that have good environments, exterminating the people already living on them, and then selling them to aliens seeking a suitable planet for a high price.

It could be that he was pals with these guys.

I have to admit, though, I don't see Vegeta around anywhere.

Is he off looking for Dragon Balls someplace else?

As you can see, I am collecting your Dragon Balls. My name is Freeza.

Now then, where are the others who were here?

According to our search, there are supposed to be ten of you.

Do you intend not to say anything?

I will kill you.

Now, let me have your answer.

Nuwainita hanitaemao moteleki koeto...

Speak in language that we can understand, as well, not in Namekian.

I know that you can speak it.

The others have left to work the farms.

All that are left are us older ones and the children.

Yes, if I can have you answer me straightforwardly like that, I will not do anything to you.

Now then, let me have you continue to answer my questions.

Where is your Dragon Ball?

I believe there is one here, as well.

I-I don't know! We don't have anything like that!

Dodoria-san...

Yes, sir?

The second Namekian we killed, as I recall, said something quite interesting, did he not?

Yes, something about him not being able to hand over his Dragon Ball, except to one judged to be a man of valor.

Yes, yes. That man proved to be quite stubborn.

We simply could not get him to cooperate with us, until we killed one of them, to serve as an example.

Once we did, he told us all sorts of things.

That the Grand Elder of this world created the seven Dragon Balls;

That the seven elders each held one of them with great care; And that each of them would ask to
match wits, extend tests of strength, and discuss the reasons for one's wish.

Then, once one is judged to be a man of valor by each elder, one would finally be able to obtain them.

However, even though I tried to do as was asked of me, I was told that he would never hand it over to me, you see?

So I could not help myself but to kill him.

As such, it took a great deal of effort to locate the first one.

The next three were quite easy.
Everyone was quite accommodating.

Hmph, I see.

So that's the deal.

A-Accommodating, you say?!

You are lying!

Yeah! There's no way the other elders handed them over to you without any protest!

I beg to differ. Once we did this, they quickly became amenable.

Zarbon-san, if you would show them.

Yes, sir.

Why, you...!

Stop!

W-What fiends!

H-How awful!

Gohan, control your Ki! They'll know we're here!

But if we don't do something...

I mean, you want to bring Piccolo and everyone else back to life, right?

There's no way we can take on someone like that.

If we show ourselves now, we'd only die in vain.

What do you say? Are you feeling a little more compliant now? Hmm?

What is your purpose in collecting the Dragon Balls?

Oh, it is quite a frivolous little wish.

I was thinking of gaining eternal life.

He's what?! Then, what about Vegeta?

H-He's out for eternal life, too.

Do you suppose they aren't friends with Vegeta?

I don't know.

The likes of you will get the Dragon Ball over my dead body!

So you are saying you would rather choose death

than give your Dragon Ball to me? I see.

The people of this planet seem to be very stubborn, indeed.

But then......can you still remain stubborn after the death of those children?

W-What?!

You'd even go after children?!

There's a strong battle power.

Freeza-sama, over there!

Oh, you've come, have you?

The Namekians!

They're coming to help!

Damn, that ill foreboding I felt proved true!

We cannot have this, can we?

I was finally about to have the Dragon Ball brought out, too.

Imagine, you interrupting your work, so that you could come here and be killed.

I see now. The rumors of people attacking the villages and stealing the Dragon Balls are true, are they?

You'll pay for this!

How dare you trample the peace of Planet Namek?!

Ho, you intend to fight us?
How great is your battle power?

Dodoria-san?

Yes, sir, I will check.

Please do not be disappointed.
All three are in the vicinity of 1,000.

There is no need for us to even fight them.

So that's it. I now understand how they are able to so precisely locate our few villages, which dot the land across the vastness of Planet Namek.

They are able to search, using those devices!

How laughable!

You want to tangle with us, with a battle power of 1,000 ?! Eh?!

He's wrong. Those three are just suppressing their Ki.

Don't these guys even know that much?

The Saiyans were surprised by that, as well, huh?

Let 'em have it!

What is this? That's what you call a battle power of 1,000?

What's going on here?
All three have increased to 3,000!

Well, well, they are pretty good, are they not?

I get it. The Namekians are a race that are able to control their battle power.

Such is a very rare type.

All right. Including his, there are only three of those devices that remain unbroken.

Children, stand away from me.

Quickly!

Dodoria-san...

Yes, sir.

You guys are pathetic.

You're going to trouble me with this, are you?

May I take care of all three of them?

Feel free.

Y-You bastard! Did you really think you could defeat me with such a petty technique?

Oh, no! He was going after the Scouters!

Scouters?

T-Those devices that can tell an opponent's strength and location!

So that's it! Then they can't determine the precise location of the Dragon Balls after all!

They use those Scouter things to look for the Namekians, and then strong-arm them!

Which is why, when the old-timer there figured it out, he destroyed all of their Scouters!

Why, you...!

I-I'll kill them all!

I'll kill them all!!

I'll kill every last one of them!

Elder! Look out!


Dodoria in Terrifying Hot Pursuit! Vegeta Learns the Truth" 
  


--Elder!
--Dodoria-san! Just a moment!

Begin by first killing the three younger ones!

Damn it!

I'll put all three of you away in ten seconds!

Ridiculous! Do you think you're a match for all three of us?!

Am I a match for all three of you, you ask?

Such an amusing joke.

What?!

--What?!
--It's no use!

It will take more than that attack to defeat him!

You must now realize that defying me or trying to run away will do you no good.

But, in any event, come on down here.

You have finally become compliant. That will do.

You destroyed our precious Scouters.

What do you say you produce your Dragon Ball for me, to apologize?

I've got no other choice.
But promise me one thing: That you will not harm the children, no matter what!

It could have been this way from the beginning.

Why, those lousy...!

H-Hey, Gohan, don't go getting any funny ideas.

We are just no match for those guys.

Now, take this, and leave here at once!

Good work.

While we are at it, how about you tell me where the other two Dragon Balls are?

Don't be absurd! We Namekians would die before doing anything like selling each other out!

Now, hurry up and get out of here, like you promised.

My, my, not you, too?

No one on this planet ever says anything about their companions.

Sure enough, I must have you die, along with the children.

What did you say?!

That wasn't our agreement!

You said if I gave you the Dragon Ball, you wouldn't do anything to us!

But unless you have all seven Dragon Balls together, there is no meaning, is there?

You have destroyed our Scouters, so I must ask you to tell us where the remaining two balls are.

I told you, I'll die before telling you where my people are!

Is that how badly you wish to die?

In that case, I will do as you ask.

What?!

kill all three of them.

--Yes, sir.
--T-That was dirty!

You two run away! Run away from here!

R-Right!

Let me show you some Namekian pride!

Cargot!

Control yourself, Gohan!

Control yourself! There's nothing we can do!

Cargot... Cargot! Cargot!

You never had time to show us your so-called "pride"!

It's a trivial matter to crush a kid like this.

Well, be that as it may, die!

Stop!!

What?! A buddy of yours?! Where?!

That'll show you!

W-Who are you?!

That idiot!

I am going to belt you!

You're gonna what?

Kuririn-san?

Y-You dumb-ass! G-Get out of here, quick!

Quick!

Right!

D-Damn it...

Go after them! Dodoria-san, catch them!
Gohan! Fly as fast as you can!
If they catch us, it's all over!

Right!

You fools! Do you think you can get away?!

It's no use! He's faster than us!

He's catching up!

Gohan!

Oh, no!

Damn it!

I won't make it in time!

Gohan, run! Hurry! He's coming!

Damn, these guys sure are slippery!

Kuririn-san, let's descend and fight him!

We can't! He's not an opponent we can get anywhere with by fighting!

Just keep flying as fast as you can!

Ah, I know!

Gohan, from here on, don't look in my direction! Close your eyes!

I have an idea. Got it?!

Yes!

Take this!

Taiyo-ken!!

My eyes! My eyes! My eyes!

I did it! I-it worked!

Gohan, hide now, while we can!

Right!

Damn it, where did you go?!

Damn it all!

It's all right. He'll never find us.

The old man destroying those Scouter things really saved our butts!

If he had one of them, he could even detect the Ki coming from that little kid, after all.

Damn, how am I supposed to find those puny guys?

This is driving me crazy!

Thank goodness. He's giving up, and leaving.

I'll just blow them away.

See you in hell!

Take that. That's what you get for sneaking around.

Freeza-sama told me to bring them back, but this is better than letting them get away.

But then, I never did find out who those punks really were.

They weren't your run-of-the-mill kids.

But it doesn't matter either way, now.

We're saved!

For now, let's head back to where Bulma-san is, okay?

Are you able to fly?

Y-Yes.

T-Thank you so much for saving me.

If you want to thank someone, thank Gohan, here.

I was so scared, I didn't want to help.

But Kuririn-san, if you hadn't saved us, we'd both be dead.

Well, in any case, come with us.

We're not exactly the bad guys here, after all.

Okay.

There are, in fact, Dragon Balls here, but these weirdoes keep ganging together, And if they all get taken away like this, there's no reason why a fragile lady like me should have to risk all the danger to come to this planet, is there?

Am I right?

Hey, Dad, are you listening?!

Oh, yes, I'm listening to every word.
So, what's the matter?

Anyhow, everything is as bad as it can be.

The spaceship is all busted up, and we can't come home.

Come home?

That's not a good idea, is it?

Goku just barely took off for there.

Huh? Son-kun? Son-kun is coming here to Planet Namek?

Really? He really, really is?

Yeah, that's right. He's scheduled to arrive in about six days.

Hooray!

Hey, Bulma!

You know, without Scouters, it's gonna be a big pain finding those last two Dragon Balls.

Sure, it's not that big a planet, but still...

V-Vegeta! Why, you...!

Yo! it's been quite a long while, hasn't it, Dodoria-san?

A-Are you the one that blindsided me, Vegeta?

You and Zarbon are always hanging around with Freeza, after all.

I was waiting for you to go out on your own.

After all, as long as Freeza isn't around, I'll bet I can handle you.

What?! A Saiyan like you?! You've got quite a smart mouth, don't you?!

Vegeta, you hand over that Scouter, nice and easy, and then beat it.

Do that, and I'll let you go this one time.

So that's it. The sound cut out all of a sudden, so I thought something must have happened, and sure enough, it sounds like you've lost your Scouters.

This is great. Now, if I approach, you won't know it.

What did you say?!

It will take several days for you to go back to Planet Freeza to fetch some more Scouters.

I'll bet you want this.

You've decided to hand it over, huh?

It's about time you felt intimidated.

Now, if you're lucky, I might just spare your life.

H-How could you do that, Vegeta?!

W-Why did you destroy it?

Because I don't need it anymore.

W-What? Without that thing, you don't know where Freeza-sama or the Namekians are, either.

Unfortunately for you... while fighting the earthlings, I learned that they could tell an opponent's strength and location without having to use a Scouter.

And there was another Saiyan there who possessed the technique.

In which case, I should be able to do it, too, right?

It's easy, once you learn how to do it.

Although, it would be too much for you or Freeza to handle, since you only have your eyes set on power.

But then, I was like that, too, up to now.

I get it! Those runts I was chasing were earthlings, weren't they?

Earthlings?!

You've joined up with the earthlings, haven't you?!

Dream on! There's no way the earthlings could have come here.

If they were here, I'd take care of them first thing!

None of that matters! Just get out of here!

Unless you'd rather I kill you!

L-I'm offering to let you go!
You should be grateful!

What are you so scared of?
Why don't you come at me, already?

I know why.

You learned from my fight with Kewie that my strength is much greater than it was before, and now you're afraid!

You saw it on your Scouter, right?

My battle power?

T-That rating was wrong!
It was a Scouter malfunction!

Don't you shrug me off!

You're the one who's shrugged me off!

There's no way that move was going to work on me!

We Saiyans grow stronger with every fight.

The stronger our opponents are, the more our strength increases.

That's why, after nearly getting killed in battle on Earth, I've powered way up!

That's what the warrior Saiyan race does!

Is this what's become of your vaunted power with you slacking off? Eh?

W-Wait, Vegeta! if you'll let me go,

I'll let you in on a little secret!

It's about your homeworld, Planet Vegeta!

What?

Did you say Planet Vegeta?

What secret about Planet Vegeta?!

Let me go! Let me go, and I'll tell you!

Y-You're not gonna kill me as soon as I've told you, are you?

I'll kill you right now unless you tell me! Start talking!

Your homeworld of Planet Vegeta wasn't lost in a collision with a giant meteor, like Freeza-sama told you.

What did you say?

Individually, a Saiyan's strength is nowhere near Freeza-sama's...

But if a bunch of Saiyans united together, it would prove to be quite a problem.

What's more, there were a small number of Saiyans being born who, like you, were becoming extraordinary warriors, and the number was starting to grow.

Once you started inexplicably possessing such power, you wouldn't remain an obedient, order-following race forever, so at that point, Freeza-sama decided that he needed to take measures.

And so, Freeza-sama destroyed Planet Vegeta, and all of the Saiyans on it, himself!

But Vegeta, you should be grateful to Freeza-sama.

It appeared that he could make use the prodigious skills of you, the prince of Planet Vegeta, and so Freeza-sama intentionally waited until you were no longer on the planet.

Looks like your shock is as great as you'd expect.

I'll just use this opportunity to return to Freeza-sama.

Don't misunderstand, Dodoria.

I don't give a damn about the planet, my friends, or my parents.

I'm just disgusted at myself for not knowing this, and letting myself be used as your doormat ever since I was a kid!

Freeza-sama!

Freeza is afraid of the fathomless potential of the Saiyans.

I have to hurry up and conquer this 50-times gravity.

Now, to get started!


Vegeta's Secret Plan! Tragic Attack Upon the Namekians" 
  

I've killed Dodoria.

For all the power that Dodoria prided himself on, it was easy.

I've improved so much, even I am surprised.

That battle on Earth was indeed good for something.

Although I have to admit, Dodoria did say something unusual.

I get it! Those runts I was chasing were earthlings, weren't they?

True, I do sense two large powers getting farther away from me.

They couldn't possibly be earthlings, but it does bother me.

Maybe I should go check them out.

Whoever they are, I have to eliminate anyone who might get in my way, even the small fry.

The cave where Bulma-san is hiding is just a little farther that way.

This is your first time on this planet.
I'm surprised you know it so well.

What's that?! Something's coming at incredible speed!

Hide! Hurry!

R-Right!

They're going to find us, out here in a place like this, aren't they?

Never mind, just suppress your Ki, right now!

We'll have to leave the rest up to fate.

Is it that monstrous-looking bastard again?

Damn it, how did he figure out where we are?

Both of those powers have disappeared.

What's going on?

It happened right around there, abruptly.

Kuririn-san! Up there!

V-Vegeta! So he really is here on this planet.

How can it be that he's here?
This is a complete disaster!

He's still looking around.

He wasn't wearing one of those Scouter devices.

So how can he tell where we are?

Y-You don't think he's gained the ability to sense Ki, do you?

If so, this is bad. Even with us suppressing our Ki, this kid still has his slight Ki...

Damn, have I misread things?

It might be because I'm not used to this power-sensing technique yet.

Maybe I shouldn't have destroyed that Scouter.

Hmm? I sense a small power.

This time, I'm not misreading it. Now to find it...

He's coming this way!

I-It's hopeless! He's gonna find us!

Around that rock there.

At this point, we have no choice but to fight.

Even though we know we'll get killed.

--Let's go!
--Right!

Now!

A fish, huh?

Oh, well.

Right now, getting my hands on the two remaining Dragon Balls-- no, even just one of them, comes first.

If I can just hide one of them, Freeza will be unable to get all seven of them together.

Then I'll wait for Freeza and the others to leave themselves open, and take their five from them.

Having them lose their Scouters means that luck is on my side!

We're saved!

I thought we'd had it for sure, there.

We sure got lucky. I've gotta hand it to that thing in the water.

Anyhow, let's head back to where Bulma-san is, while keeping our presence as masked as we can.

--It's right nearby, isn't it?
--Yes.

We didn't even fight, and I already feel exhausted.

I want to get some rest.

I'm, uh...

I'm honestly beginning to wish we hadn't come to this planet.

I know that's not fair to the late Yamucha-san and the others.

But far from bringing everyone back to life, it looks like there are going to be even more deaths.

Do you mean us?

Mm-hmm.

Look, Kuririn-san! Over there!

Oh, right, right.

Bulma-san!

Huh? She's not here.

She must be hiding further inside the cave.

Bulma-san!

It's us! Where are you?! Bulma-san!

A Capsule House!

What have you been off gallivanting around for?!

Leaving a young lady here, all by herself!

Gallivanting, she says.

Who's the small-sized Piccolo-looking fellow there?

By any chance, is that a Namekian?

It's all right.

Eh? Did something happen?

Please, just let us come inside right now.

We'll tell you everything that happened.

Oh, right!

I just got some welcome news from my dad!

Son-kun has taken off, and is headed here to Planet Namek!

And get this, he'll arrive in just six days!

You see, my dad took the spaceship that Son-kun rode in on when he was a baby and completely rebuilt it!

What's more, Son-kun is going to undergo incredible training inside!

F-Father is coming?

--Hooray!
--Yahoo!

Undergoing incredible training, you say?

Great! Great! Now we have some hope!

Next up, this, for 30 minutes!

I'm sensing them! Large powers!
There are at least 20 of them!

No doubt about it, there's a
Namekian village out there!

And they probably have a Dragon Ball.

Freeza and the others don't have Scouters.

No matter what action I take now, they won't know about it!

I knew it. The folks in this village are still alive, which proves that Freeza and the others haven't been here yet.

--What's this?
--An alien.

Is your elder here?

I have come to get your Dragon Ball.

W-What?!

I am the elder.

Would you mind telling me why you want the Dragon Ball?

Never mind, just hand it over, right now! You do have it, right?

Leave us. I cannot give it to you.

I can sense evil coming from you.

Then die.

Bang!

Elder!

Eat up. Don't be so reserved.
It's not all that great, though.

You can't blame him. Most of his village just got killed, right?

Oh, right. This isn't really the time to eat, huh?

We don't eat this sort of thing.
We get by just drinking water.

Get out of here! There were fields around your village, and you were growing vegetables, or something, weren't you?

Those were Ajissa saplings.

Ajissa saplings?

Yes. Long ago, before the climatic anomaly, Namek was supposedly a pretty world, dense with Ajissa trees.

But then......the Ajissa forests, along with us Namekians, almost completely died out.

So now, we're increasing the number of Ajissa trees there are, in an attempt to make Namek beautiful again.

Say, what's your name?

Dende. Um, who are you people, exactly?

K-Kuririn-san, is that...?

What's going on, all of a sudden?
Is someone coming again?

N-No, it's not that.

There are Ki out there, diminishing, one after another.

T-The Namekians are being killed once again.

T-The one doing the killing is someone we know quite well.

Vegeta! He's attacking a different village now!

W-What an awful bunch those guys are!

S-Sure enough, Vegeta has learned a technique to sense Ki.

This is a problem!

We'll have to watch how we move around until Goku shows up.

I'm not sure if Vegeta and that Freeza fiend are working together, but if either one of them use the Dragon Balls to gain eternal life, it would be the end of the world!

If we were to find just one of the Dragon Balls, and hide it, they won't be able to get all seven of them together.

We can't! if we did that, they would keep looking, until they had killed all of the Namekians!

O-Oh, no!

This sucks, no matter what happens.

E-Even once Goku gets here, there's no guarantee that he can beat them.

Damn!

If only I'd finished off Vegeta when I could...

P-Please tell me more about yourselves.

Where did you come from? How do you know about the Dragon Balls?

P-Please save the people of my world!

Why, you...! How could you do this?!

You aren't going to hand over the Dragon Ball, no matter what, huh?

I'll be damned if I give it to you!

You are one utterly stubborn old man.

Okay, then, suit yourself. I'll find it on my own.

Wait!

Grate on me, will you?!

Here I thought it would be hidden, but there it is, on grand display.

This Kami-sama guy was a Namekian who had fled to Earth.

We want to use the Dragon Balls here to bring our fallen friends back to life.

If our wish is granted right, the Dragon Balls on Earth will return, as well.

S-So that's what's going on, is it?

I've finally unraveled the mystery of who you are.

Please, come with me!
I will show you to the Grand Elder!

Grand Elder?

Who's the Grand Elder?

T-The one who gave birth to all of us here on Namek.

The sole survivor of the climatic anomaly long ago, who has once again given vitality to Namek.

I am the Grand Elder's th child.

The sole survivor? How is it that you folks have children?

How? We lay eggs out of our mouths.

Oh, is that right? That's unusual, huh?

S-So then, the Grand Elder is a female, right?

Female? What's a female?

W-What is it? There are two kinds of Namekians, right? Male and female.

Let's see, for example... you have your father, and then your mother.

Two kinds? N-No...

Did you hear that? They don't have males and females.

What a dull planet. I'm glad I'm not Namekian.

Er, never mind that, tell us, why are we going to the Grand Elder's place?

The people who attacked our village already had four Dragon Balls.

A-And you said a lot of people were just killed over in that direction, right?

Y-Yeah, probably by a guy named Vegeta.

There isn't a single Ki remaining there.

They were probably completely wiped out.

In that case, there aren't very many Namekians left on this world.

R-Right. if Vegeta found the Dragon Ball in the village he attacked, that means there's only one left.

By any chance, does the Grand Elder have the last one?

Y-Yes.

Oh, no!

Freeza may have lost his Scouters, but Vegeta has gained the ability to search for Ki!

If he searches for his Ki, he'll arrive at the Grand Elder's place before long, and steal the seventh Dragon Ball from him!

T-Then we have to let the Grand Elder know at once!

I beg you! I beg you!

If either Freeza or Vegeta are granted eternal life, it would be awful!

All right. Let's hurry. Show me the way.

Right!

I'll go see the Grand Elder with Dende.

Gohan, you and Bulma-san wait here for me.

There's no point in all of us going, is there?!

All right. Be careful.

Remember, Gohan, you guys be careful, too!

Right!

Now then...if I submerge this Dragon Ball here, no one will be able to find it. 
I'm the only one who knows it's here.

Freeza and the others have five Dragon Balls.

I guess I'll go look for the last one.

Dodoria is far too late in returning.

Could he still be pursuing those unusual runts?

Never mind.

If the fool cannot catch those two kids, then leave him be.

Never mind him, go and find the last two Dragon Balls.

Yes, sir, as you wish. if we search the remaining villages, the Dragon Balls are sure to be there.

With the two of us searching, we should at least be able to find their villages.

Then, I shall take these five Dragon Balls, and wait for you back at the spaceship.

I am counting on you.

Once we have just two more of them, I can have my wish granted.

Yes, sir.

You look over in that direction.

If you find a village, do nothing, and come let me know.

If there are any strong Namekians, you won't be able to handle them.

We'll meet up again in three hours, back at the spaceship.

Yes, sir.

It could be that Vegeta has already located the two that remain.

Even so, he will likely be coming after our Dragon Balls.

That could be good, and save us the bother of having to find him.

Once Vegeta comes after them, we will turn the tables, and take his two from him.

By doing so, we shall have all seven of them together.

And then I shall be given eternal life.

Now then, to wait at my leisure in the spaceship.

Vegeta seems to have grown even stronger than before.

And I sensed an even stronger Ki from that Freeza guy.

I don't know what kind of training Goku is going through, but this time, even he might not be able to handle them.

In any case, let's get the Dragon Ball that the Grand Elder has, and hide for the five and a half days it will take for Goku to arrive.

After that, all we can do is wait for Goku to work a miracle.

If I'm getting so I'm expecting miracles, it's all over, huh?

Tch, I didn't have any female presence in my life at all.



Resurrected Companions! The Beauty Soldier Zarbon's Demon Transformation"
  


All right... good...

I've gotten pretty accustomed to 20-times gravity.

Now, how about I try 30-times?

Goku! Do you hear me? Goku! Huh?

Hmm? Ah, that voice! Is that you, Kaio-sama?

Yeah, it's Kaio, all right.

You're not, by any chance, in space, are you?

What are you doing in space?

Oh, I see. Planet Namek, right?

I hope you do find Dragon Balls there.

What, you didn't know, Kaio-sama?

There's something terrible happening on Planet Namek.

Something terrible? Well, you can tell me about it later.

As it turns out, I've had some visitors come by.

Visitors? What about them?

It's incredible! These visitors traveled the Serpentine Road and arrived here in far less time than you did.

What's more, there are four of them.

--Four of them?
--That's right.

And I'm sure you know these four quite well.

I-It couldn't be!

They all want to receive training even more strenuous than you got.

T-That's awesome!

You mean they all arrived at your place together, Kaio-sama?

May I speak to Goku?

Place your hand on my shoulder, and then talk.

Yo, do you hear me, Goku?

Yamucha!

We met the departed Kami-sama in the Next World, and he told us about this place.

Hey, we heard that you are going to Piccolo's homeworld, to look for the Dragon Balls, so that you can bring us back to life.

You said there were four of you, right?

Yamucha, Tenshinhan... and is Piccolo there, by any chance?

Yeah, Piccolo's here, too.

Hmph, my pride wouldn't allow for you to be the only one who got stronger.

Who is the other one? Is it Kami-sama?

No, not him. Kami-sama stayed in the Next World.

Get this, it's Chaozu!

Chaozu?! But Chaozu got blown to pieces. Is he all right?

Yeah. Kami-sama regenerated a body, especially for him.

That's awesome! Good for you, Chaozu!

I'll tell you, though, the gravity here has us beat.

Our bodies are so heavy, we can't even run properly.

Yeah, I know, I know.

But right now, I'm headed for this Planet Namek place, which has the Dragon Balls, and I've started training under much, much more intense gravity.

I have to get much stronger in the next five and a half days, or there's gonna be real big trouble.

Eh? What do you mean? What happened?

I was severely injured, so Kuririn, Bulma and Gohan went to Planet Namek to look for the Dragon Balls.

But once they got there, that Saiyan, Vegeta, was also there looking for the Dragon Balls.

--What?!
--S-So then, did they get themselves killed by him?!

No, it looks like Vegeta still ain't realized that Kuririn and the others are there.

But that ain't all, either.

There's something else, even more unbelievable.

There are apparently some other strange folks after the Dragon Balls.

The weird thing is, their outfits are just like Vegeta's.

What's more, one of them has a Ki far higher than Vegeta's.

W-What?!

What? What's going on?

By any chance, is his name Freeza?

I don't know. I ain't heard, but when I find out, I'll tell you.

If it is Freeza, this is a huge problem.

G-Goku, I'm going to look in on Planet Namek.

Please do, Kaio-sama!

Let's see, which direction is Planet Namek...?

Yamucha, tell us what's going on.

I-I do sense an enormous amount of Ki, all right.

Checking to see where this Ki is coming from...

Wha--?

Freeza!

What's this? Kaio-sama, you know who it is?

Goku, this time around, your opponent is too much for you.

Or I should say, he's the worst of the worst!

There is no way you can handle this guy!

What do you mean?

Listen to me, Goku. This is an order! Do not go near him!

Once you get to Planet Namek, take the other three aboard, and run away, immediately!

I'm not just saying this for your sake.

I'm saying this for Earth, Planet Namek, and all the other worlds.

If you launch a half-baked attack on him, and get him angry, something horrific will happen!

Leaving him alone is the only thing you can do!

Is he really all that great?
I'd kinda like to see him.

Don't you dare go near him!

--Yeah, but...
--No buts about it!

Goku, do whatever you have to to gather the Dragon Balls, and bring us back to life.

Piccolo!

I'm going to improve myself here even more than you did, and go to Planet Namek.

Together, we'll send that absurd what's-his-name bastard flying.

D-Don't be ridiculous! You guys don't know a thing about Freeza!

There's no time. Start training us, right away.

If you're planning to fight Freeza, I won't teach you anything!

Promise me that you won't go to Planet Namek.

All right.

You mean that, right? I'm trusting you.

That goes for you guys, too!

There's no way I'm going to keep a measly promise like that.

If I do the same training that Goku did, I won't be able to surpass him.

I'll have to work out the key points of the training, and then hone my techniques on my own.

All right, then, let's get started.

Here we go...

Let's do this!

First off, try to make me laugh with a pun.

I will train whoever can pass this test!

Even if I can't take any action, there ain't no harm in getting stronger.

All right, let's try kicking it all the way up to 50-times gravity!

Hey, if we keep flying at this rate, when will we reach the Grand Elder's place?

W-We should make it in another five hours.

Damn, I can't find anyplace that has multiple powers gathered together.

What does this mean?
Are there no more villages?

There are two powers on the move.

Strange. One of them feels different from both Freeza's men and the Namekians.

It's disconcerting. I think I'll go check it out.

Stop, Dende!

It's Vegeta! He's taken notice of us, all right!

He's headed straight this way at tremendous speed!

We have to hide, now!

Huh?

W-What happened? He changed direction.

There's another large Ki out there!
He went in that direction!

This power belongs to Zarbon!
No doubt about it!

I've been waiting for him to make a move on his own!

If only I had a Scouter, finding a village would be easy.

That's... Vegeta!

Yo! it's been quite a long while, hasn't it, Zarbon-san?

I've already disposed of Dodoria.
Now it's your turn.

What?! Y-You've disposed of Dodoria?

Easily.

I don't believe it.

You'll be able to tell once we go at it.
I'll show you how strong I am.

Vegeta, why would you turn against Freeza-sama?

That's simple. I never have liked that Freeza bastard.

Up to now, I've been forced into submission by his power, and had no choice but to do as he said, but now, by an odd turn of events, I've learned that I can gain eternal life.

You're talking about the Dragon Balls.

I'm not about to let Freeza have them!

Once eternal life is mine, I'm sure the chance to beat Freeza will come along.

What foolishness.

Do you think eternal life is all you need to beat Freeza?

It's a shame you don't have your Scouter.

By fighting many battles, I've increased my power more than you can imagine.

You're the one who doesn't understand.

Freeza-sama's power far transcends even that level.

That's enough of your mindless babbling!

I heard from Dodoria that Freeza was afraid of Saiyans!

I'm going to show you some Saiyan power, right now!

You've got such a swelled head.

What Freeza-sama was afraid of was the Saiyans banding together.

Just one of you can't do anything.

Well, we'll see about that.

What?!

To think that he could deflect that!

Incredible! it's Ki slamming against Ki!

Vegeta and someone else are mixing it up.

H-His opponent is probably that guy who was at Freeza's side.

Both of them are monsters.
There's no way I can compete with them.

Let's just hope the two of them end up crushing each other.

All right! Hold on to me tight!

This is our chance!
While those two are battling it out, we're going to rush to the Grand Elder!

If I fly all-out, we should reach there quickly!

Here we go!

What's the matter?!

For someone as fast as the great Zarbon-sama, you look like you're standing still!

What?!

To think that you'd be so helpless at this level!

You surprise me. You have indeed made outstanding progress.

However, as a result, you have awakened my true power, which has lain dormant for many years.

What? Your true power, which has lain dormant for many years?

Are you saying you've got such a thing?

That is correct.

That's a hilarious joke!

Before you die, I will tell you why I have let my true power remain dormant.

In order to display my true power, I must transform.

However, my transformed appearance is quite ugly.

As someone who prefers beauty, I cannot bear it. 
But I would rather choose to transform than choose death.

Transform, you say? The way we Saiyans do?

People who are backed into a corner will say the most ridiculous things out of desperation.

Hmph, I do not become unnecessarily large, like you Saiyans do.

My power just increases.

Overwhelmingly so!

Hey, it seems like a lot of time has gone by since we got to this planet, but the sun shows no sign of going down. Why is that?

The sun doesn't go down.

I mean, there are three suns, and they all come up in turn.

So then, there's no such thing as night on your world?

No, there isn't.

Well, okay then.

Let me see it.

You don't even need to ask.
I'll show you, right now!

W-What is this?!

My appearance isn't all that's transformed!

Get a load of my power now!

Hey, Dende, are we almost at the Grand Elder's house yet?

It's just a little farther ahead.

We have to do something while Vegeta and that other guy fight.

Damn it, I will not be beaten!

No matter how you struggle, you cannot beat me!

Incredible! Even as far away as we are, I can feel the Ki from their battle!

My power before I transformed doesn't compare to what I have now!

It's no use. I thought I had powered up on Earth, but...

You're not going to get an easy death!

Vegeta, have you met your end?

He's not showing himself. it would seem that he was unable to move, and ended up drowning.

Hmph, he put me to a lot of trouble.

He even made me perform my hated transformation.

Now then, I suppose I should report this to Freeza-sama.

Z-Zarbon! This isn't over yet!

I-I will become much, much stronger!

And then I will defeat both Zarbon and Freeza!

I-I won't let anyone have the Dragon Balls!


Kuririn's Power-Up! The Foreboding Squirming of Freeza"
  


There it is. You can see that tall rock there, right?

That's it?

That was a long way.

The Grand Elder is inside that house.

I'm surprised it's still here.
As conspicuous as this place is, it's only a matter of time before the bad guys find it.

He hasn't been done in already, right?

He couldn't be...

Nail-san! Thank goodness! You're all right, then!

H-He looks just like Piccolo!

I'm glad you made it here, Dende, and the visitor.

The Grand Elder already knows the gist of what's going on.

Then the Grand Elder sees what is happening?

That saves us the trouble of explaining everything.

Both of you, come inside.
The Grand Elder will see you.

U-Um, if you already know roughly what is going on, w-why haven't you left such a dangerous place as this?

The Grand Elder has grown too old.
He knows that his death is near.

There was nothing else we could do but let him remain here while I protect him.

I'd heard he was near his end, but I didn't know it was so serious.

Come, inside.

This guy can handle himself.

Compared to the other Namekians, I sense remarkable power from him.

Up above.

Right.

Grand Elder, Dende, and a visitor.

H-He's huge!

Welcome. You are an earthling, right?

First, I would like to express my gratitude for saving my child, Dende.

Thank you.

Er, not at all. I-l wasn't able to do all that much.

Whoa...!

I'm maxed out... I've gotta rest for a bit...

Still, I've mastered 50-times gravity a lot sooner than I thought.

Looks like my duel with Vegeta wasn't entirely for nothing, huh?

Because of those villains, most of my children on this world have been killed.

It grieves me.

They seem to be after the Dragon Balls, don't they?

Yes.

I never imagined that those globes of hope, a testament to the wisdom and power of the Namekians, would bring this about.

Forgive me for coming right to the point, but could I ask you to let me borrow that Dragon Ball above your head for a short while?

I will never give it to those guys. I promise.

You are collecting the Dragon Balls, too, are you?

Yes. I want to bring my fallen friends back to life.

I would like to request it, as well.

Grand Elder, if these people's friends return to life, they might be able to put down those evil men.

How do you know about the Dragon Balls?

We had them on Earth, as well.

You what?!

Long ago, during the crisis on this world, there was a Namekian who fled to Earth.

He created our Dragon Balls.

Ah, yes, I remember now.
That was the child of Katattsu.

What a surprise. To think that he safely arrived on Earth.

He was a gifted Dragon-type child, who could create Dragon Balls.

He was also killed, along with the rest of our friends, by a Saiyan named Vegeta, who has come here.

The Saiyans are indeed formidable.
That poor child prodigy...

That Saiyan wouldn't happen to be a Super Saiyan, would he?

W-What is that?

G-Gentleman from Earth, could I ask you to come over here?

Sure...

Please allow me to explore a little of Earth's past.

P-Past?

Oh, my goodness! Evil entered into him, and his body was split into two.

So in order for him to become Kami, he could not have even the slightest evil sentiment.

As a result, the evil Piccolo was born.

However, it is a pity.

Imagine, him halving his prodigious inborn powers like that.

If he had become one again, like he originally was, he may have made it through without dying.

O-One again?

Well, I suppose it's all right. 
Your desires are pure, after all.

Your courage up to now is greatly esteemed.

I shall give you this Dragon Ball.

Terrific!

Thank you very much.

So this is an original Dragon Ball.

It sure is big.

However, your wish is not likely to be granted.

Why not?

Unfortunately, my life will only last a few more days.

Can you steal the balls already gathered by those villains in that time?

More than likely, it will be quite impossible. Once I die...

Grand Elder!

...the Dragon Balls will also be extinguished.

It's all right! We have no choice!

For the time being, I will protect this Dragon Ball with my life!

It's far better than letting those guys have eternal life, after all.

If you'd be so kind. I no longer have the strength to protect it.

I'll make sure to!

You possess exceptional power.

It's a shame you still have so much power left dormant.

Dormant power?

Allow me to release that power.

No way, I couldn't have that kind of power left.

I've trained quite extensively, after all...

Even now, I'm beyond my limits!

Please find a way to somehow escape their clutches.

The power... the power...!

The power is starting to gush forth!

Incredible!

U-Unbelievable! it feels like I've been reborn!

Thank you very much!

U-Um... can you call forth anyone's power?

Like say, from a small child?

It is possible for anyone, as long as they have dormant power.

If you do this too much, will it shorten your life?

All I do is provide the trigger.

It has nothing to do with my lifespan.

W-Would it be all right if I brought another one of my friends here?

He's sure to have an enormous amount of dormant power.

Then bring him here.

The more powerful people we have on the side of right, the better.

Right! I will bring him here right away!

U-Um, what about this?

Please take it with you.

I leave the future of this world, and the universe, in your hands.

Dende, you wait here. 
I'll be right back with Gohan.

P-Please be careful.

Mm-hmm.

This is awesome! Who'd have thought I had this kind of power?

I should be able to pick up Gohan in just a few hours like this!

H-How can this be?

A village that we haven't attacked yet has already been wiped out!

If I submerge this Dragon Ball here, no one will be able to find it.

I have to get that Dragon Ball back, no matter what...

What happened? Who did this to you?

T-The Saiyan took our Dragon Ball...it was Vegeta, all right.

T-The Dragon Ball...

Die already, will you?

Freeza-sama, it is Zarbon.

Enter.

Did you find a village?

No. As of this moment, I have not found any villages, but I did defeat Vegeta.

Ho, did you? Then Zarbon-san, you transformed?

The first time in a long while?

--Yes, sir.
--So, is Vegeta dead?

Well, I did not exactly check for his corpse, but if, by some slim chance, he is still alive, he would be gravely injured.

Why did you not confirm that he was dead?!

W-Well, Vegeta was submerged under the water, so...

You could have gone under the water, correct?

You failed to confirm that he was dead because you dislike getting wet.

Also, you were rash to have killed him right away in the first place.

What if Vegeta has concealed a Dragon Ball from us someplace?

I-I am terribly sorry. I will go check at once.

Freeza-sama!

I have discovered a village!

H-However, the village has already been wiped out!

What did you say?

I think it was most likely the work of Vegeta.

Then he does have a Dragon Ball somewhere after all!

There was one villager still alive, but I disposed of him at once.

Then you killed our one and only witness?

S-Sir...?

I dislike hasty, unwise actions more than anything.

If Vegeta is dead, then you had better prepare yourself, as well.

Bring Vegeta back here at once.

This time, you should set your hopes on him being alive.

Appule!

Yes, sir?

Contact Planet Freeza, and inform the Ginyu Special Corps that they are to report here.

And needless to say, tell them to bring Scouters, as well.

They should arrive in five days.

Understood!

F-Freeza-sama, why bring in the Ginyu Special Corps?

Forgive me for saying so, but I believe that there is absolutely no reason to call them in.

I am getting an unusual foreboding.

W-What kind of foreboding?

I have considered this for a little while now, but I have gotten the feeling that a powerful Saiyan has grown up, who will become my enemy in time.

At first, I thought it was Vegeta, but it would seem that I am wrong.

A-Are you sure you aren't imagining things?

As far as Saiyans go, except for Vegeta, there is only that what's-his-name on Earth, and his son.

And their battle powers are supposed to be lower than Vegeta's.

Are you telling me that my foreboding is misplaced?

--N-No, sir!
--Never mind that.

I would like you to bring Vegeta back here at once.

Y-Yes, sir!

The Ginyu Special Corps...

Saiyans do indeed appear to possess fathomless battle power.

Every time they battle, it rises greatly.

Of course, they are no match for me, but thinking ahead to the future, I have to nip this in the bud now, while I can.

It would be most inopportune if one of them became a Super Saiyan.

I slept pretty good. I wonder how long I was asleep.

It's no use! I'm so worn out, I can't move at all!

Damn it...

I am not... going to die...!

W-What's this? He's still alive?

You're a tough one.

But then, this time, it's because you're tough that I'll be spared.

We're going to treat you. You're lucky.

Say, Gohan-kun, look at this!

One of the Dragon Balls started moving.

It's coming straight toward us.

Could that be Kuririn-kun?

That must be it! Hooray!

I'm sure he saw the Grand Elder, and got his ball!

Hold on a second. Then what is this other one, here?

These five here are probably the ones that that Freeza guy has, right?

But look, there's one right here, all alone.

Huh? You're right, and it's close to here.

Let's see... in that direction, right?

We said that Vegeta was attacking a village, remember?

It's in that direction!

B-But Vegeta isn't there.

I can't sense his Ki.

I get it! He attacked the village, but wasn't able to find the Dragon Ball!

Mm-hmm.

He must have figured it wasn't there, and went off someplace else.

Please let me borrow the Radar. 
I'm going to go get that Dragon Ball.

Way to go! We caught a bit of luck, ourselves!

--Well?
--His condition is quite serious, sir.

His vital signs are extremely weak, and even if he completely recovers from his injuries,

I can't be sure he'll ever regain consciousness.

Bring him around, no matter what it takes!

Do everything possible for him! Got it?!

Y-Yes, sir.

Otherwise, it will mean my life.

Great, great! Now's my chance!

I don't sense the Ki of anyone scary nearby!


The Conspiracy Completely Shatters! Vegeta's Counterattack vs. Zarbon" 
  


You've taken quite a bit of damage.

This could take a while.

Come on. if you don't regain consciousness, I'm the one that Freeza is gonna take it out on.

That should do it. Now I just have to wait until you wake up.

How is Vegeta?

Sir, he should be regaining consciousness shortly.

That is good, is it not?

Y-Yes, sir.

W-What was that explosion?!

It cannot be...!

Looks like you underestimated my recuperative ability.

Now then...

Damn! it came from the treatment room, all right!

Zarbon-san, quickly!

Oh, no! He fled outside!

He did what?!

Good! Freeza is with him!

Quickly! Quickly, go after him!

W-Why, you...!

Quickly! Find him no matter what!
He could not have gotten very far!

Fools. You fell for that all too easily.

Dear Freeza-sama, Right now, as of this moment, your reign is at an end.

Your beloved Vegeta.

I win!

Let's see...it's around here.

H-How awful.

I'm sure Vegeta must have done this.

Where are you? Where are you?!

Where did you run off to, Vegeta?!

He couldn't have gotten away that quickly.

He must be hiding somewhere.

You still have not found him, Zarbon-san?!

If you have the nerve to allow him to get away from you like this, you will die to take responsibility.

Fool! Keep searching around outside all you like!

One... two... three... four...

All five of them are here, all right.

They didn't just heal my injuries, they're going to have every last one of their Dragon Balls stolen by me, as well.

But I can't get away cleanly carrying all five of them.

What's more, I don't have much time to think.

All right...

Please, let this work!

Hey! You fell for it! I'm still inside the ship!

--Wha...?
--He's what?!

D-Damn him!

Now!

Where is Vegeta?!

D-Do not tell me that Vegeta is after the Dragon Balls!

All right! Now for me!

T-The Dragon Balls!

T-That bastard!

W-Where is he this time?!

F-Freeza-sama, could he still be inside the spaceship?

Find him!

Y-Yes, sir!

If I were to foolishly flee by air, Freeza would catch up to me in no time.

What a disgrace!

Not only did you let Vegeta escape, but he has the Dragon Balls, too!

There is no way he could have escaped in a flash carrying all five Dragon Balls!

I shall search inside the spaceship.

You will thoroughly look around outside!

--Yes, sir.
--L trust you are ready to answer for this.

If one hour passes, and you are unable to bring Vegeta back here...

Y-Yes, sir...

Huh? This way?

Not inside one of the houses?

I get it! Not even Vegeta would have found it inside the lake.

I did it!

Here it is, here it is!

I'm sure they must have landed around here somewhere.

There they are! There they are!

Outstanding control, if I do say so myself!

Take that, Freeza!

I've finally gotten his Dragon Balls!

Now, if you include the one I sunk by that village, I only need one more to have all seven!

There's a strong battle power...! Is that Zarbon?!

No, it's not. The battle power is lower than Zarbon's.

I-Is that...?

Just you wait, Gohan! Once you go to the Grand Elder's place, you'll become much, much stronger!

It's that earthling!

W-What's he doing on Planet Namek?

What's more, he was carrying the last Dragon Ball.

Luck is on my side from top to bottom!

That was fast! I'm almost there!

It looks like that earthling is after the Dragon Balls, too.

But I will be taking the one you're carrying!

Now I'll have all seven of the Dragon Balls!

D-Damn it, Vegeta! Where are you?!

If only I had a Scouter, it would be easy to find you!

The way things are going, my life will be forfeit to Freeza-sama.

Is that Vegeta?!

No. That's the guy who came to the rescue of that Namekian kid.

But he's carrying what looks like a Dragon Ball.

Vegeta!

I've found you at last! You're all mine now!

There's a tremendous battle power following me.

Looks like Zarbon found me.

Tch, what a pesky bastard.

Still, this is a good opportunity.
I'll put him away for sure this time.

He's completely heartened by our last battle. He'll be off guard.

Huh?

It's you, Kuririn-kun! Don't startle me!

T-This is dangerous, isn't it, Bulma-san?

If you stay outside, casually reading a book like that, they're going to spot you.

What are you talking about?! if I stay inside the cave the whole time...

I-Is that, by any chance, a Dragon Ball?

Bingo!

The home-soil Dragon Balls are huge, aren't they?

The Grand Elder was quite reasonable.

Oh, right, right! Bulma-san, is Gohan inside the house?

I want to take him to see the Grand Elder, too.

He went to go find another Dragon Ball.

It showed up on the Radar.

Near that village that Vegeta attacked, remember?

Really?

A-A Ki! it's headed this way, and it's almost here!

It's Gohan-kun! That was fast, huh?

No, it's not Gohan!

V-Vegeta!

Crap! I was so carried away with becoming stronger,

I didn't notice his Ki!

I wouldn't have expected to meet you here, earthlings.

I didn't think you had the technology it took to travel to this planet.

Judging by the Dragon Ball you're so delicately holding, it would seem that we have the same objective.

Listen up. Before I take that Ball from you, there's something I have to do.

But you'd better not get any funny ideas, like taking that and running away with it.

It won't be just you that dies, but the woman, as well.

So, you're here.

W-Who is that guy? Judging from his face, I wonder if he isn't our knight in shining armor.

N-No way...

T-This is as bad as it gets!

What's as bad as it gets? He's a pretty fine-looking man, isn't he?

Please don't go judging people by their appearances at a time like this!

But usually, the hunk is the good guy.

This is not Earth, it's Planet Namek.

I know that.

Bulma-san, you don't understand anything.

You've done quite a job of mocking me, Vegeta-san.

I see. I also recognize that little runt holding the Dragon Ball.

You guys are together, are you?

Yoo-hoo!

Yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo!
Stick it to Vegeta, okay?

Hmph, yeah, right.

It doesn't matter to me.

Vegeta, where did you hide the remaining Dragon Ball?

I'm going to bring you before Freeza-sama, and make you tell us.

Just try it.

You'll never learn.

Don't you mess with me!

If this keeps up...

Hmph, you're finally getting into it, huh?

He's a bad guy, all right!

W-What is this?! He turned into a monster!

And what's more, his power shot up like crazy!

You fell for it, Zarbon!

Damn it!

Bulma-san, now's our chance!
Let's get out of here!

But he said he'd kill us if we ran!

We'll be killed if we don't run! Hurry!

Oh, no you don't!

Damn! Nothing gets past him!

I'm sensing two incredible Ki!

They're coming from where Bulma-san is waiting for me!

Vegeta, how dare you...?

Looks like that took quite a toll.

Your strength has dropped considerably, hasn't it?

Zarbon-san, your death would appear to be at hand.

My death is near?

Don't make me laugh! My battle power is higher than yours!

Zarbon-san, I thought you were supposed to be well acquainted with Saiyans, weren't you?

You were wrong to have carelessly treated me after I came close to dying. isn't that right?

Every time a Saiyan recovers after being near death, they are able to rapidly raise their battle power.

So that's it. Come to think of it, Goku also got stronger after each intense battle.

Damn, so that's why Vegeta's Ki rose so much, is it?

I don't care how much you've raised your battle power, there's no way you can beat me when I'm transformed, and am able to exhibit my true power!

The Saiyans are a warrior race!
Don't mess with us!

V-Vegeta... I-I was just following Freeza-sama's orders...

Let me go... p-please...

After all the time you've spent pushing me around, don't you dare go asking anything for yourself!

I-I know... Let's team up together...if we do that, we could beat even Freeza...!



A Hair-Trigger Pinch! Gohan, Protect the Four Star Ball" 
  


if we could defeat Freeza just by teaming up, it would be too easy.

Now then...I don't know how you did it, but you seem to have raised your battle power somewhat beyond what it was on Earth, haven't you?

However, it still isn't at the level where you could fight me as an equal. What will it be?
I don't suppose you feel like quietly handing over that Ball?

I-I doubt it would do any good to make any promises with you, but if I give this to you, will you leave without making any trouble?

A promise, huh? Well, all right.

As long as I get the Dragon Ball, there's no sense in playing around with you guppies.

Y-You mean it?

Don't push it. Hand it over before I change my mind, unless you really do want to get killed.

K-Kuririn-kun...

You guys are lucky.

I'm in a good mood, because I've found all seven Balls.

Now I'll be the one to rule the universe, instead of Freeza.

I am going to gain eternal life.

Kuririn-kun, you gave it to him pretty readily, considering, huh?

And after all the trouble you went through to get that Dragon Ball, too.

He said that was the last one, so it's all over now.

If I hadn't given it to him, he definitely would have killed us.

It's near-miraculous that the two of us are still alive.

Besides, it was probably safe to let him have that Ball.

The Dragon Ball that Gohan went looking for has to be the one that Vegeta hid, to keep that Freeza bastard from getting all seven of them.

Oh, yeah! Gohan-kun has to have found that Dragon Ball by now, and is now headed this way, right?

That means that things didn't go the way Vegeta planned, did they?

Mm-hmm... so long as Vegeta doesn't find Gohan, that is.

Something's coming from directly ahead!

It's a very strong Ki!

Vegeta!

Hmm? Suddenly, I sense a strong battle power, directly ahead.

Have to mask my Ki!

Its presence just vanished! impossible!

I know it was around here.

Vegeta, hurry up and get out of here!

Who's there?! Come on out!
I know you're out there!

Show yourself now, or I'll blow this entire area away!

He wouldn't!

What are you waiting for? Huh?!

All right, maybe it would be better to jump out and fight Vegeta.

But then...

Gohan, there's no way we can stand against Vegeta right now.

Sure enough, I've got to protect this Dragon Ball.

You're not going to come out, are you?

All right!

As you wish! I'll blow you away!

Rats!

Wait!

Please, don't let him find this.

I-It's me!

Kakarrot's son, huh? I wouldn't have thought that was possible.

Those other earthlings were here, though.

It's no surprise that you'd be here, too.

A Dragon Ball!

D-Don't tell me that's...!

Hmph, this? it was a present, from that slick-headed friend of yours.

Y-You killed Kuririn-san, didn't you?!

I can still go back there again and kill him, if you want me to.

Be grateful. To celebrate getting all the Dragon Balls together, I let him live.

A-All of the Dragon Balls...

Hey, what's that you've got in your hand?

This is a clock!

Hmph, a clock, huh? I'm surprised that with a scientific capacity that can't make a clock any smaller than that, you even got to this world.

Who asked you?!

By the way, is that Kakarrot bastard here, too?

No, he isn't! We didn't know there would be bad men like you here!

Hmph, is that right?

That's a shame, isn't it?

The three of us are the last of the Saiyans.

Listen, when you get back to Earth, give him a message for me.

Tell him I'll be coming to Earth soon, and this time, I'll blow him and the Earth away for sure.

You must be missing your mother's milk by this time.

Hurry on back to Earth, now.

T-T-That hurt...

S-Still......the Dragon Ball is safe.

Ka......me... ha... me......Ha!!

S-Senzu... senzu... senzu, senzu...

Whew, I have to be more careful.

I caught a glimpse of the Next World, there.

If I die, I can't train, or nothing else.

I'll get there in a little more than two days.

Well, guess I'll keep at it for a while longer.

Damn... isn't he here yet?

Kuririn-kun, I collapsed the house back into a Capsule.

Isn't Gohan-kun here yet?

I-I still don't see him.

You don't think Vegeta found him, do you?

Vegeta knows about this place now.

We have to change locations, fast!

What could Gohan be doing?! Hurry! Hurry!

Kuririn-san!

He's here!

Kuririn-san, I found this!

You did it! We've been waiting for that!

Gohan-kun, way to go!

Gohan, I'll explain things later, but we have to get away from here, fast, or we could be in hot water.

I've got a pretty good idea.
I was spotted by Vegeta, too.

But I managed to hide the Dragon Ball, so I got away without him finding it.

You got pretty lucky, too, huh?

Kuririn-kun, Gohan-kun, let's just hurry out of here!

Right.

This is the lake. This is where I submerged the Dragon Ball.

Once I get it out of here...

I'll have all seven Dragon Balls together.

Take that, Freeza! As of this moment, the entire universe is mine!

That's strange. I'm sure it sunk right around here.

It's gone! Impossible!

I-It was him!

The spot where I ran into that kid was exactly midway between here and the cave those earthlings were at!

That miserable brat!

But how did he find the Dragon Ball?

This is a clock!

That was no clock! It was a radar!

Damn it...!

You earthling punks!

Mess with me, will you?! You'll pay for this!

Damn it all!

Damn it all!!

Where are you, you punks?!
Get out here, or you'll be sorry!

Damn it! You're gone, are you?!

Damn it, I can't sense their presence, either.

Those punks can control their presence all the way down to zero.

I can't find them like this.

You miserable earthlings!
That was an insolent stunt you pulled!

But then, they're also sure to come after the six Dragon Balls that I have at some point.

And when they do...

it's all right. He won't find us here.

Hold on, I can't even set up the house in a place this narrow, you know!

Please, don't ask the impossible.

There aren't going to be very many caves like that last one here.

Just tough it out until Father gets here, Bulma-san.

So until Son-kun gets here, a lady like me is going to have to stay here, in a place that doesn't even have a bathroom, with you two?

Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

I'm going to be taking Gohan with me, and heading back to where the Grand Elder is.

Huh? Why is that?

What is this?! You mean you're going to be leaving me here by myself?!

Please, just bear with us.
Once Gohan sees the Grand Elder, it's possible that he might become strong enough to rival even Vegeta!

He sure is taking his time.

What has Zarbon-san been doing these past few days?

Seeing as how he has not returned, he has either fled, or been killed.

If I had known it would be like this, I would have brought the Ginyu Special Corps along from the start.

Damn it.

If that device the kid was carrying really is something that can find Dragon Balls......I can't be too careful about leaving this spot.

Those guys want these six.

I'll just have to wait for them to make their move.

Freeza appears to be pretty frustrated.

I knocked out the engine of his spaceship, which means he's stuck here.

Confounded Vegeta...!

W-What is with these earthquakes that just started up?

Oh, brother, I can't take any more of this crazy planet!

Even supposing he called for someone to bring more Scouters, at best, it will take a few days for them to arrive.

I have to settle this before then.

If I can just achieve eternal life with the Dragon Balls, then depending on my tactics, I'm sure I can defeat Freeza!

Now, when he doesn't have any Scouters, is my chance!

Damn it, at this speed, it will take us quite a while to reach him.

But if we use any more Ki than this, that bastard Vegeta will find us for sure.

He seems to have gotten even stronger.

As it stands, even if we both went at him, there's no way we'd win.

But then, are you sure I have the kind of power that would rival Vegeta's?

I don't think I do.

Nah, I had this much dormant power.

So I think that we can expect quite a lot out of you, with your Saiyan blood.

More likely than not.

Kaio-ken!!

All right...

Ka......me......ha......me......Ha!!

Yikes!

That was a close one!

But then, my body has gotten a lot tougher.

Freeza-sama!

We've just received a message from the Ginyu Special Corps!

They are just passing by 36Y47X, and should be arriving shortly.

Understood.

They are finally about to arrive, are they?

Seeing as how, fortunately, nothing has happened, it would appear that Vegeta was unable to collect all seven of the Dragon Balls.

Never forget, once the Ginyu Special Corps brings those Scouters, I will be able to find you anywhere.



The Super Decisive Battle Draws Near! The Ginyu Special-Squad Has Arrived!"   


It's been almost four days now.
Is it much farther?

Yeah, there still is a way to go.
Damn, the Grand Elder is dying!

All right...

Let's try picking up the pace dramatically.

As far away as we are now, there's no way Vegeta will notice us.

You're right. Besides, Father will be here soon, too.

That settles it! Let's fly at full speed!

Right!

If we fly at this speed, we'll be there in an hour.

Right!

I've finally found them!

There are two presences--Kakarrot's son, and the runt he's with.

I thought that they would be coming here, to take my Dragon Balls, but they're pretty far away, instead.

I don't know what they're up to, but if I pass up this opportunity, I doubt I'll have another chance to get the location of the last remaining Dragon Ball out of them.

If I take this one with me, then even if that woman locates this place with her strange device, she still won't get all seven of them.

All right!

You're going to pay this time for sure! Say your prayers!

9,999 ...

10,000 ...!

Awesome! Most of my fatigue is gone!

I've even surprised myself!

All right, then, that's it for my training.

I'll rest up good with the time I have left.

I have to get used to normal gravity, too.

Wow! I'm so light!

What a surprise! I'm so light, it's like I ain't even here!

Light! Light!

So light! So light! So light, I say!

And so strong, so strong!

Strong! Strong! Strong! Strong!

After training myself this hard, I'm sure I could withstand even a times-ten Kaio-ken!

"Shampoo"

I'm almost to Planet Namek, huh?

All right, let's do this! Let's do this!

Oh, that was relaxing!

Now then, all that remains is to sleep tight.

But before I do that...

Let's see... here we go.

Huh? This is the wrong one.

This one's bitter, after all.
Let's see... here it is, here it is!

This one, this one! Bulma's daddy's specially made sports drink!

Goku hadn't realized that somewhere along the way, he had gained a level of power great enough to overcome the limits of his Saiyan capabilities.

Hang in there, Gohan!
The Grand Elder's place is just up ahead!

Right!

I know I said that once we have the Grand Elder release Gohan's dormant powers, he would be a match for Vegeta......but to be honest, I don't think we can hope for that much.

That bastard really is gifted.

He keeps getting stronger, with no end in sight.

Once we get Gohan stronger, we'll have to wait for Goku to arrive, and then the three of us will have to take him on.

I'm almost there...
I'm almost there, you dirty punks!

Gohan, it's within sight!

Do you see it? That tall peak!
That's where he is!

All right, we're in the home stretch!

G-Gohan, a Ki! There's a Ki coming up behind us!

I-It can't be!

D-Don't tell me it's Vegeta!

Gohan...

I'll stall him here with everything I've got.

You go on ahead to where the Grand Elder is!

--But...
--Hurry it up! Go get yourself made stronger!

Okay?

Right!

All right...

I'll just have to do what I can.

What speed!

Yo!

I-I'm surprised you could detect us.

Of course I did. I'm not like you guys.

Now, why don't you return that four-starred Dragon Ball that I had hidden?

Take me for a fool, will you?

What in the world do you mean?

Keep playing dumb. 
I'll make you talk in a hurry.

Oh... this is incredible...

What's that?

That mountain, where Kakarrot's son ran to...

There's something else there, too.

Is that where you've hidden the Ball?

N-No!

W-Wait!

You possess such tremendous latent ability.

You are an earthling, aren't you?

Excuse me, but could I ask you to hurry?

He is here.

What is this place?

Wait, Vegeta!

Please wait!

--Leave.
--Hmph, sounds like you want to die.

All right! Gohan's Ki just went up!

I get it. Kakarrot is here, is he?

All right, today's the day we settle our score!

Come on out, Kakarrot!

What?!

I-It's you? What did you do in there?

Why has your base power risen so dramatically?

Sure, your battle power may have risen beyond comparison to what it used to be, but still...

You want to tangle with me, at your level?

Fine.

Grand Elder!

--D-Dende...
--Yes?

G-Go and tell the others at once...

There is a great, unknown power approaching Namek.

--Grand Elder!
--H-Hurry...

R-Right!

L-Listen! The Grand Elder says that someone else is approaching the planet!

--What?
--Grand Elder? Who's that?

You're right. Something really is coming.

I-It's an incredible power!

It's Goku! Goku is finally arriving!

What?!

I'm not so sure. it feels like there's more than one...

I-It can't be!

1... 2... 3... 4... 5...

N-No doubt about it!

Freeza has called in the Ginyu Special Corps!

Damn it!

You guys, give me your Dragon Ball, right now!

N-No! We won't do that!

I'll make you a promise!
After I obtain the power of immortality, I'll never lay a hand on you!

Hurry up, or there won't be any undoing what happens!

Y-You can't fool us!

If we did that, we'd be playing right into your hands!

Listen to me closely, you filthy bastards.

The Ginyu Special Corps that Freeza has called in consists of men as strong as I am-- no, maybe even stronger-- and there are five of them!

They're going to use new, cutting-edge Scouters to find me and you, and then come to kill us, right away!

You can't mean that!

Can't you sense their power?!
There's only one course of action!

The course that involves making me immortal, and defeating them!

What he is saying might be true.

There are indeed five evil powers out there.

Damn...

Then... let's make Gohan immortal...

He may have the power, but tactically, he's completely inexperienced!

B-But then, if we do this, then why the hell did we even...

The Dragon Balls will grant you three wishes.

Your wish is sure to be granted.

Three? Not just one?

Th-Three...

You guys!

Would you quit going on about this?! Hurry it up!

We may already be out of time!

H-Hey, you're sure... you're sure we can get three wishes granted?

Mm-hmm.

Follow me!

But just remember, we're gonna hold you to that promise!

Wait for me!

Damn it all!

Fly as fast as you can!

So, they've left.

Yes. However, even if it works, their chances of winning are extremely low.

--Nail-san...
--Nail...

...you go with them, too. 
You can be of some help.

--But...
--L will be all right.

My life should hold out a little longer.

Very well.

So, the Ginyu Special Corps has finally arrived.

I have been waiting for this.

Aren't we there yet?! They've already landed!

A little farther...

Why did this have to happen to me?

What in the world was that?! Huh?

Bulma-san, we're taking the Dragon Ball with us.

All right, hurry! This way, now!

H-Hey! Just what is going on?!

Gohan-kun!

Hey! Fill me in before you leave!

Do you have any idea how hard I'm having it here?!

Of all the...!

Boy, those guys are... Hmm?

H-Huh? Wasn't that Vegeta with them just now?

Special Corps! Special Corps!
Special Corps! Special Corps!

ReaCoom!

Butta!

Jheese!

Ghurd!

Special Corps! Special Corps!
Special Corps! Special Corps!

Ginyu!

To...ge...ther...we...are...

The Ginyu Special Corps!

I-I have been expecting you.



The Special-Squad's Frontline Man! Break Gurudo's Spell"   




Well done, everyone.
I have been expecting you.

Thank you very much, Freeza-sama.

Please tell us what our mission is this time.

The traitor Vegeta has taken the Dragon Balls that I had gathered and run away with them.

Please rough him up without killing him and bring him back here.

I would like to force out of him the location where he hid the Dragon Balls.

That is a simple task. Our Scouters have already picked up Vegeta.

He appears to be passing through an area not too far from here.

Is something the matter?

Who might these two who are with him be?

They appear to have considerably high battle powers.

Two of them?

Ah, those must be the children who interfered with us before.

So, they are working together after all.

What shall we do?

You are to kill them.

Very well. We will thoroughly enjoy ourselves.

Freeza-sama, the Scouters you ordered are in this case.

Good work.

We will take our leave now!

Special Corps!!

Ginyu!!

Fight!!

They're on the move!

Th-They're fast...! Hurry! They're catching up!

5 minutes to arrival on Planet Namek...5 minutes to arrival...

Kaio-sama didn't have to send me this many!

Someone even more incredible than Vegeta, huh?

Be alive, guys.

Ten more minutes.

It's strange. I don't feel any fear.

Why am I so calm?

Even with someone so unheard-of down there...I ain't feeling nothing.

Maybe training in all that gravity has made me go crazy.

Over there!

We've got them!

Yo, Veggie-chan!

Long time no see, huh?

Damn! I was so close, too!

By any chance, is that one of those Dragon Ball things?

Hmm? There are five of them over here.

Freeza-sama will be thrilled about this.

You have to have all seven Dragon Balls gathered together, right?

There are five behind us, and the two you're carrying.

That's all of them, isn't it?

V-Vegeta was telling us the truth.

I wouldn't offer any challenge against them.

And even among those guys, he's in a whole different league.

I-I'm not about to let you have them!

He, at least, isn't all that big a deal.

W-Why is he mixed in with the others?

Stay back! I can't stand your stink.

--Die!
--Whoa...

Don't go off on your own, Ghurd.

We haven't yet decided that he's your kill.

Why don't you hand it over already, Veggie-chan?

Although, even if you give it up, nice and easy, we aren't planning to go easy on you.

You guys may be able to search for people with those things, but I bet you can't find these!

And what if we can't?

This is what!

--Welcome home.
--I'm back.

Wha--?!

Th-That's impossible...!

It looks like you were trying to throw it far away. That's too bad.

Unfortunately for you, Butta has the greatest speed in the universe.

Now then, for the other one...

Destroy it!

Damn it!

The Dragon Ball...

How...?

So then the rumors are true?!

What rumors are those?

That Ghurd is able to control time momentarily, and can even stop it.

Th-That can't be for real!

Oh, yes, it's for real.

So then, that's all of them.

And now it's your turn. Be sure to take extra good care of them.

When he says to take care of you, he doesn't mean to pat your heads and play upsie-daisy with you.

He means to beat you up!

You don't have to explain that to them!

Vegeta, is fighting our only option here?

You've figured out that running away won't do any good, right?

Having you here is better than nothing.

Even knowing that the real strength you showed me on Earth will still be useless here, I'm counting on it!

I will take Vegeta. I'll let the rest of you rock-paper-scissors over who gets those two unknown runts.

Huh?! That's no fair, Commander!

You took the lion's share last time, too, you know! You can't do this!

Sheesh... What am I to do? All right.

Then, I'll take the Dragon Balls to Freeza-sama, and you guys handle the rest on your own.

Yahoo!

I'm nice to you guys, right?!

Yeah! You're the best!

Okay, then Vegeta is first, and second... Those guys are a set.

All right, let's go!

Ginyu rock-paper-scissors!

Rock-paper-scissors!

Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

--Tie, go again! Tie, go again!
--Are you sure we couldn't run away right now?

Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

Tie, go again!

Yeah! I get Vegeta!

Tch, I get the two runts, huh?

Don't let it get you down.
It's better than not going at all, right?

I'll tell you what, I'll let you strike the final blow.

Freeza-sama will now be able to obtain immortality.

I won't let you have them!

Stop! Don't waste your energy!

Never mind him, just concentrate on defeating these guys right now!

Hey, come here a minute.

Oh, what's this, a strategy session?

That Ghurd guy that you'll be fighting has a low battle power, but he uses supernatural powers.

Keep your guard up.

Yeah.

By the way, is it true that Kakarrot isn't here on this planet?

No, he isn't. But he is headed here.

Hurry up and get here!
He may drive me up the wall, but if we had him on our side, it would increase our strength.

Why in the world did we come to this faraway place, anyway?

Not only did we not get all the Dragon Balls together, but now the bad guys are going to gain eternal life.

I hate to say this, but Ghurd, you go on ahead first.

Sheesh, I feel like the guy who has to clean up the playing field.

What's a guy to do?

Hmph, you're the same screwed-up bunch as ever!

Gohan, remember the image training we did on the spaceship!

Right, Kuririn-san!

Aww, this looks like it's gonna be over in the blink of an eye.

--All right, let's go!
--Mm-hmm!

Unleash your Ki!

W-What is this?

F-Fools!

Stop!!

Those punks...

Th-They're gone!

W-Where are they?!

There they are! They moved that far?!

They relocated in that brief moment?

D-Damn, I can't hold my breath any longer!

Those little maggots are better than we thought, aren't they?

Huh, with these Scouter ratings...

To think that they can alter their battle powers without transforming.

They're an unusual race.

Nice friends you've got there, huh, Vegeta-chan?

Their speed and power defy comparison to what they were when I fought them before. Even so...

Amazing!

Your destructive force is several times greater than before, Gohan!

It's all thanks to the Grand Elder raising my power to its maximum!

Still, he ran all the way over there!

He must have stopped time again. Let's go, Gohan!

Right!

Th-They disappeared!

Damn it!

Stop!!

They've already made it this close?!

W-Wait, I don't have to run away.

All right, first I'll take out that little runt!

Oh, crap!

Over there!

Kamehame-Ha!!

Aw, geez! We were so close, too!

Hey there, Ghurd.

Looking pretty ragtag there.

You're disgracing the Ginyu Special Corps, you know.

Ghurd, you dummy! if you let yourself get beaten by those runts, we're not going to play with you anymore!

And we'll take our snacks separate from you!

I-I just dropped my guard a little bit!

I'll finish off these maggots right away!

All right, now's our chance!
Let's take it to him, Gohan!

Right!

Here they come again!

All right...! At this point, I'll play my ace-in-the-hole!

W-What is this...?

I-I can't move my body...!

It's my paralyzing spell.

You can't move, no matter how hard you struggle!

D-Damn...!

Where's all that energy you had a moment ago?

Looks like Ghurd is really feeling the heat.

He's using his paralysis spell.
He hardly ever uses that one.

And against those two little bugs, too.

I'm going to get you back good for embarrassing me!

Hey! I'm gonna skewer you guys!

You might taste good if I grill you up!

Yeah, I'll bet you'd like to escape.

Th-Those fools!

They go and attack him head-on, even after I told them to watch out for his supernatural powers!

What's the matter? Hurry up and run away, or this huge skewer is gonna run right through you!

You can't move? Oh, you poor fellows.

All right, after I take care of the one in the gold-colored outfit with this, I'll do in the other one with a different supernatural power!

G-Gohan... can't you do anything...?

I-It's no use... My nerves are paralyzed...

Here goes!

I've been released from my paralysis!

Th-That was a dirty trick, Vegeta!

This was supposed to be a fight between me and those kids!

You guys decided that on your own.

And do you think there's any such thing as fair play in war?

T-To think that I would be beaten by a lowdown monkey of a Saiyan!

That really pops my cork!

Ha! You're the last person I need to hear that from.

Imagine, us being rescued by you...

Thank you.

Hmph, don't get the wrong idea.

Do you think I deliberately saved you?

It was just the perfect chance for me to defeat that grimy Ghurd.

This is no time to zone out.

Brace yourselves. We won't get lucky this time.

Hey, hey, hey! Ghurd went and got himself killed!

W-What do we do?!

With one of us missing, our Ginyu Special Corps' Fighting Pose will be less than beautiful!

ReaCoom!

Butta!

Jheese!

Ginyu Special Corps!

I-It's less than beautiful, all right.

We'll have to get Commander Ginyu to think up another pose for just the four of us!

Leaving that aside, we have to decide who gets to take those two runts in Ghurd's place.

Well, I get Vegeta.

All right, Jheese, rock-paper-scissors me!

--Yeah!
--First one is rock!

Rock-paper-scissors!

Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

--Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!...
--W-What are those men thinking?

--Tie, go again! Tie, go again!
--I just can't figure out their characters.

Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

--Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!
--Th-The real hell starts now.


The Hellish Recoome! Keep Me Entertained, Vegeta-chan"   



Awesome... He won the fight in the blink of an eye... Vegeta is ridiculously strong, all right. 
AA Ki! H-He's alive! He's still alive! It can't be! No way! Hi! H-He's barely... taken any damage... at all...! 
That's enough warm-up exercise. 

ReaCoom is just trying to look cool, while we get covered in dust. 
Our cleaning bill is gonna be through the roof. 
Well, shall we get started? ReaCoom Kick!! Ah! Vegeta-san! Good! That's pretty good, Vegeta-chan! You're better than I thought. ReaCoom Elbow!! 
--You got him! 
--Speed ​​Up!! 
Yoo-hoo! You've still got some spunk, huh? Good for you! Hey there, are you all right? You haven't croaked on me yet, have you? 
D-Did that get him?

Ups-a-daisy...

Nice, nice, that's the way.

Same old ReaCoom, huh?

That's for sure. He's got a nasty streak.

Don't you have any more elegant techniques?

If not, it's about time I killed you. Are you ready?

T-That monster! Damn it, I had no idea he was that strong.

He's tossing me around... like I was a little baby...

I-If I don't do something, he's going to kill me!

--Gohan...
--Yes?

I-If Vegeta gets killed, it will be our turn to die next.

I-I don't care what you try, there's no way we can beat them.

I'm pretty sure not even Goku could.

At this point, it's all-or-nothing.
Let's charge him!

R-Right!

Your life is mine!

All right, here comes my big finish!

A-All right, here goes, Gohan.

Vegeta doesn't have enough strength left to dodge ReaCoom's quick attacks.

Right!

ReaCoom...Eraser gun!!

Vegeta-san!

Move! Get out of my way!
Who asked you to do that?!

Y-You fools! if you've got time enough to save me, why didn't you attack ReaCoom, too?!

For crying out loud, your softness makes me sick!

The ground level has been blown away, and the shape of the planet has been changed.

This guy is terrifying.

That sneak attack just now was pretty good.

Taking that shot from above made me close my mouth.

And look at my teeth. I might be just a l-l-little upset about that.

Hey, Butta! Jheese!

Let me have the two little ones, too!

Okay? Huh? Okay?

Geez, what are we gonna do about him?

Okay, fine! Suit yourself!

In return, you have to buy us chocolate parfaits later!

Okay!

There you have it, you little maggots.

Kuririn-san!

Kuririn-san! Kuririn-san!

M-My bones... how can this be...?

O-One kick, and this is what becomes of me...

He's... too strong...

Th-This can't be fair...

And after the Grand Elder took the time to raise my power, too...

I'm no use at all...

Be strong, Kuririn-san! Kuririn-san!

To be honest, we're done for...

We're helpless before them, and if we run, they'd catch us right away.

They've taken the Dragon Balls, too...

Nothing good has come of this...

Rats! Now I've done it!
I accidentally used too much power!

I was going to play around with him a little bit longer! Pity.

I-I'll do as much as I can! Just you watch me!

This should be good.

F-Father...

D-Darn you, I won't lose to you...!

Outstanding, Ginyu-san.

Imagine, you bringing me all seven Dragon Balls as quickly as this.

Indeed, it was worth it to call in the Ginyu Special Corps.

There is nothing that pleases me, Ginyu, greater, than to hear you say that, Freeza-sama.

This means that I can finally obtain eternal life.

What wonderful joy.

If you would like, I will dance the Dance of Joy for you.

The Dance of Joy, for you, Freeza-sama!

P-Perhaps you could do it for me the next time.

I see.

Imagine, my dreams of achieving immortality will now come true!

It is so thrilling, even for me!

At last, it will mean the birth of a perfect, everlasting ruler for the universe.

And now, Dragon Balls, give me, Freeza-sama, eternal life and youth!

W-What is that?

I'm getting a funny feeling...

No doubt about it. In the very near future, the Grand Elder will be set upon by the hand of evil.

Forgive me, earthlings! I have a mission to protect the Grand Elder!

N-Nothing is happening, is it?

Could you have been made immortal already?

No, I do not believe so.

W-Why...?

Here, go ahead and take it.

Even if you get the Dragon Balls together, you all won't be able to have your wish granted anyhow.

A-As I recall, when I took the second Dragon Ball, that is what the Namekian said to me.

I thought it was just sour grapes on his part, but he said "you all." 
That is exactly what he said. 
"You all"!

There must be some code word for these.

A secret code, known only to the Namekians, that will grant wishes!

A password! A place! Or perhaps some way of arranging the Balls!

We will have to ask one of the Namekians!

Are there still any Namekians alive anywhere?

Hmm? I am picking up readings from Vegeta and the others.

It just might be possible that Vegeta and the others know.

In that case, I must prevent my men from killing Vegeta!

Ho? Hmm, have a look at point .

I am reading what appear to be two Namekians.

There is also a reading that is approaching that point.

We never attacked this point.

So there are some survivors, then.

Very well. I will go there at once, and make them tell me how  to get one's wish granted.

That will not be necessary.
I will go ask them directly.

After all, I am more accustomed to dealing with their kind.

Ginyu-san, you stand guard over the Dragon Balls, please.

Yes, sir! As you wish!
Allow me to take care of that!

Be careful!

Now, to get flying!

All right, here goes!

ReaCoom Bomber!!

Whoops, over here!

D-Don't get up... Gohan...

I-I am... my father's...

S-Son Goku's... son...

I won't let you... l won't let you...

Ho, ho! You still have enough strength left to spout that gibberish?

I don't know what planet you're from, but this is a surprise.

You messed with the wrong guy, huh?!

I won't let you beat me!

Hmph, he's moments from kicking the bucket.

He doesn't have any battle power left.

Of course not. His neck has been broken.

Gohan...

Tch, what a pathetic little brat.

H-Here I thought he'd improved somewhat, but...

You guys are all a bunch of disappointing scum.

I don't know why Freeza-sama bothered to summon us, the Ginyu Special Corps.

I guess I'd better finish off all three of you.

What's that?

It's landing.


Son Goku Finally Arrives! Knock the Ginyu Special-Squad Around"   



K-Kakarrot, you bastard, are you finally here?

Gohan...

Here, Gohan. it's a senzu bean. Eat it.

Gohan! Hey, Gohan!

It ain't no use. His neck is broken, and he's barely alive.

All right, it's okay. Daddy will feed it to you.

What? Hey, hey, hey, hey, who are you?

Are you friends of those punks?

I'm just going to force it down, okay?

Oh, can you stand up?

F-Father! You're here?!

Hey! That kid was almost dead!

What did he do?

Are you okay, Gohan?

Father, be careful! That guy is...

Hang on, Gohan.

I've got to give a senzu bean to Kuririn, too.

R-Right...

You really went through the mill, huh, Gohan?

Yes. I was powerless to do anything.

Why has Vegeta taken such tremendous damage?

H-He got beaten up by that pineapple-headed guy, with the incredible strength he has.

Goku...

Kuririn, sorry to keep you waiting.

Here's a senzu bean.

I don't know whether to be happy, or sad...

Sad...?

He recovered, too.

W-What in the world is going on?

Goku, you can tell, can't you, how strong they are?

I may be all better now, thanks to the senzu bean, but we're just gonna get beat up again.

Not even you stand a chance, Goku.

Their strength is a whole other order of magnitude.

Even Vegeta was powerless to--

Oh, yeah, right...

Now that you mention it, why did they attack Vegeta?

Ain't they on the same side?

Yeah, apparently, they used to be on the same side, but...

You don't have to talk. 
Let me probe around for myself.

P-Probe?

Oh, I get it.

I understand now.

Like why you two have so much more power now, and how Bulma is okay.

About the Dragon Balls being taken from you, and about Freeza, and these guys, too.

Y-You're kidding, right?!
How do you know these things?!

Dunno. I just got the feeling that if I did this, I'd know.

Vegeta seems to be the same old nasty character, but whatever the circumstances, he saved your lives, didn't he?

W-When did you gain that ability?

Only one senzu bean left, huh?

Vegeta!

Go ahead and eat that!

Hey, that was the last one, right?! Why...!?

M-My body...!

T-That was stupid!

Are you planning to heal him, and fight them as a foursome?!

That's not going to help!

That ain't what I'm doing.

I want to settle the score with him later, on Earth.

Settle the score later? You mean...

--Yeah.
--H-Hey...

I'm gonna take care of these guys by myself.

T-Take care of them by yourself?!

F-Father...

You're going to take care of us by yourself, you say?

You're one strange dude.

W-What is he thinking?
He hasn't gone mad, has he?

He can't win, no matter what he does.

What's come over you, Father?

Make this at least a little entertaining, all right?

Hey! What's this maggot's battle power?!

He really is a maggot.

He's only around 5,000 !

Aw, that's disappointing.
You're just a big blowhard, are you?

This is strange, all right.
Why is he so unusually calm?

Doesn't he realize his opponent's ability?

That can't be so. But then...

I don't sense the least bit of bloodlust from him.

I-It couldn't be...! That bastard is...?

Hey, now, is something the matter with you?

What can you hope to do with such a puny battle power?

Huh? This guy's crazy, all right.

He's about to get himself killed, and yet he's smiling.

You can't beat me.

I can tell that without even fighting you.

Of all the things you could have said!

Hey, did you hear that?! This maggot just told the biggest whopper!

He really has gone crazy.

He never used to boast like that.

You don't suppose Father doesn't realize his opponent's power, do you?

I-It couldn't be...
No, that would be impossible...

That lower-class warrior, Kakarrot...couldn't possibly become a legendary Super Saiyan!

I can't afford to stand around here anymore and listen to the jests of a half-wit like you.

I'll shut you up forever, in the blink of an eye!

I-It's said that a Super Saiyan appears once in a millennium.

A Super Saiyan, who overcomes barriers that even the most gifted warriors can't conquer. 
I-it can't be...!

That's just a ridiculous bit of folklore.

A-And even if the legend is real, I'm the only one who has the potential to become a Super Saiyan!

Okay... are you ready for this?

Ginyu Special Corps! ReaCoom!

Mach...Punch!!

H-He vanished!

W-What the...?

Huh?

H-Hey, what just happened?

What?!

W-Why, you...!

W-When did you get here?!

Ah! He's all the way over there!

It looks like Vegeta is the only one who followed Goku over there.

Did he see him move just now?

You guys are in league with that bad guy Freeza, right?

If you act now, you can get away without being hurt.

You should get out of here.

W-What?!

You little bastard. You seem pretty secure in your speed, at least.

But no matter how long you fight, you'll never win by running away!

All right, if that's how you want it, I'll reveal my ace-in-the-hole!

It won't matter how fast and nimble you are!

After all, the whole area around me, ReaCoom, is gonna get blown away!

T-This will show us what Kakarrot's real merits are.

I'll send all four of you into the next world with this one!

ReaCoom...Ultra...Fighting...Miracle Attack!!

Sorry about that.

You left yourself wide open, and I couldn't help myself.

Sorry, sorry.

Y-Y-You little punk...

Did Father defeat him?

You've gotta be kidding, right?

I don't care if he did catch him off-guard, he knocked off the guy that Vegeta, you and I couldn't faze, no matter how we attacked him, with just one blow...

W-What's going on here?! ReaCoom's been...

Th-That attack couldn't have been much of anything!

D-Damn it all...

Th-That was no ordinary attack just now. You can't fool my eyes!

I-It was a devastatingly heavy blow.

He has clearly surpassed the Saiyan fighting level.

How the hell did he do it?
What kind of training did he do?

I-Is the legend true? Is he a Super Saiyan?

What will it be, you guys?

Are you gonna go on back to the world you came from?

Or do you want to be clobbered like this guy?

Did you hear that, Butta?
The macho man is dreaming again.

Yeah. Apparently, he has the mistaken idea that he beat ReaCoom based on his ability.

It was just a weird fluke, paired with ReaCoom letting his guard down.

Yeah. Of course it was just a coincidence.

His battle power rating barely changed at all.

W-What's the deal with Goku's self-assurance?

Father...

Hey...

The Ginyu Special Corps' Red Magma...

Jheese!

As well as the Blue Hurricane...

Butta!

So you ain't gonna leave, then?

Here we go!

Yeah!

You keep messing around with us, and--

W-Why, you...!

Whatever you say, but you guys leave yourselves way too open, don't you?

W-W-What did you say?!

--Y...
--You little...!

W-What was that?!

What did he just do?!

A Kiai push...

He sent them both flying with just a Kiai push!

K-Kuririn-san, do you get the feeling that those two aren't as strong as we thought?

They can't lay a hand on Father.

No, that can't be true.

They have the same amount of Ki as that ReaCoom guy, and not even Vegeta could do anything to him.

Maybe it's just that Goku is too strong for them, and it only looks like they're not so tough.

M-Maybe. But Father's Ki is so much smaller than theirs.

W-What's going on? His battle power is unmistakably 5,000.

Kakarrot is no doubt raising his battle power sharply in the brief moment when he attacks.

Probably to avoid consuming any unnecessary energy.

It's such a brief instant that not even the Scouters can pick it up.

H-He has a tremendous battle power.

H-How can he have that much power?!

This is pissing me off!

I will not let that two-bit nothing make a fool out of me!

Hey, Jheese! Let's get him with the Purple Comet Crush!

Purple Comet Crush, huh? That sounds good.

All right, let's do it, Butta!

Yeah!

Purple Comet Crush!!

Sheesh!

What could they all be doing, while leaving a delicate lady all alone?!

That goes for Son-kun, too!

Saying he got behind schedule isn't going to cut it with me!

He's got to come and take me back, as soon as he gets here!

If I stay here too long, my skin will be damaged, and my good looks will be ruined!

Oh, man! What is this?!

Well? What happened?!

Th-That bastard...!

Jheese...

What, Butta?

At this point, you use your Crusher Ball on him.

With his speed, he'll probably dodge it and run away.

What are you going to do?

Isn't that obvious? While he's desperately trying to escape, I'm gonna slam him from the back.

I don't care how fast he is, my speed is the fastest in the universe!

All right.

But why should we have to, against that scum?!

Damn it!

Crusher...

...Ball!!

Now, come to me!

Well?! Why don't you get out of the way?!

He deflected it!

D-Damn you!

Damn it, where did he go?!

Behind you, Butta!

What?!

--Yo.
--W-When did he get behind me?!

Behind me, who boasts the greatest speed in the universe!

Well, maybe you're second greatest now.

H-How is this possible?

Not only did he deflect my Crusher Ball, he got behind Butta!

It's like I'm having a nightmare!

Who are you?!

A Saiyan, raised on Earth... or so I'm told.

Don't you mess with me! How can a Saiyan have that much speed?!

How am I supposed to know?

Must be all of my intense training, right?

But then, you won't be able to beat me with only speed!

Not if you keep zipping around like that!

After you can't run anymore and your movements slow down, that's when you die, you little...!

Damn it! I'm not gonna let a member of the Ginyu Special Corps be mocked by a lightweight like you!

It's all you can do just to dodge me!
I could defeat you at any moment!

I'm not so sure.

What did you do that for?!

What about you?! What were you looking at?!

--Why, you...!
--Why, you...!

L-Look, this is no time for us to fight between ourselves, right?

Y-Yeah...

You want me to show you?

How there's more to me than just speed?

--What...!
--What...!


Star Performer Entry!? Commander Ginyu vs. Son Goku"   





Both this guy and the last guy ain't dead yet.

Hurry up and take them with you, and get off of this planet.

Don't be a fool, Kakarrot!
Finish them! Finish them off!

These guys have been through the wringer!

There ain't no need to kill them for no reason, is there?

H-How can this be?
We're the Ginyu Special Corps!

We are a five-man elite unit, made up of the cream of the crop from all over the universe!

How can someone of his low level...

This is a nightmare!

Getting beaten, and being powerless to stop it! Damn it...!

Ah, he ran away!

That guy is hopeless.
He left his friends behind.

Hey...

A-Are you really Goku?!

Vegeta!

What's wrong with you?

I told you, there ain't no need to finish them off!

Those guys couldn't even move.

Your treacly sentimentality always makes me sick!

Why did you let that one guy get away?!

The way you are now, you could have easily disposed of him!

It would appear that you weren't completely able to become a Super Saiyan.

Super Saiyan?

You may be proud of how overpoweringly strong you've become, but you won't beat Freeza like that!

Not unless you become immortal.

You have absolutely no idea how fearsome Freeza is!

I hate to say so myself, but I think I've gotten pretty strong.

And you still say there ain't no way I can beat Freeza?

That's what I'm saying.

If you plan on fighting him, you'd better be prepared for it.

Freeza's strength is probably far greater than you can imagine!

Y-You've got to be exaggerating a little bit, right?

You saw how incredible Goku is now.

Those guys were helpless before him!

How could anyone beat Goku now?

Then go ahead and fight him.

What's worse, Freeza has gained immortality with the Dragon Balls by now.

There's no way to beat him, by any stretch of the imagination.

We can only hope we don't run into him.

No...

I don't think he's had his wish granted yet.

What? How do you know that?!

If the Dragon Balls here are like those on Earth, then when Shen Long appears, it should get dark, right?

But it's been bright out this whole time.

I don't think it's happened yet.

Sh-Shen Long? What's that?!

Does something come out of the Dragon Balls once they're all together?

Th-That's it! I get it! He doesn't know what the password is!

He thought he could get his wish granted as soon as he collected all seven of them!

Password? Y-You need that?

There's still a chance left for us to get our wish granted!

Oh, yeah!

Right, Gohan?

Hey, Gohan, we still might be able to bring the guys who are dead back to life!

Hooray!

Goku, we've got to get the Dragon Balls back somehow, right?

Shen Long...?

What?!

Ghurd, ReaCoom, and Butta have been done in, you say?

Yes, by someone you wouldn't even believe.

Don't be absurd!

We are the Ginyu Special Corps!

Except for Freeza-sama, there is no one in the world stronger than the Ginyu Special Corps!

That's what I thought, too. But the fact is...

So the disappearance of those three battle power ratings was not the result of a Scouter malfunction, then?

We must contact Freeza-sama!

You've gotta be kidding! How can we tell him anything so disgraceful?!

It's a good thing Freeza-sama isn't here.

I, Commander Ginyu, will personally show you how to fight.

I-If you please.

Hide the Dragon Balls!

If they come up missing, we will incur Freeza-sama's wrath!

Yes, sir!

There's no way anyone will find them now.

All right then, let's go.

I'm going to take my time and show them just how terrifying I am!

Ginyu Special Corps, move out!

It just isn't very striking with only the two of us.

And I had just thought up a new one, too.

I don't know who you are, but you'll pay for this!

Oh, are you going to pay!

I've had it with Dad.
Where does he get off saying that Son-kun should have already arrived on Planet Namek?

Once Son-kun gets here, he's going to come rescue me first.

I wonder if Son-kun really is here already.

It would be nice if we could get the Dragon Balls back somehow.

Vegeta, you know a lot about these guys, right?

Ain't there any way to do that?

I thought you were going to defeat Freeza.

If I can, I'd like to, but first, we've gotta bring the guys you killed on Earth back to life.

Even if you get your worthless wish granted, before too long, Freeza will blow them away, along with the Earth, and what will it matter then?

Forget about that; let me have my wish for immortality granted.

You can't be serious!
If we were to let you do that, it would be no different than if Freeza did, would it?!

There are two battle powers coming this way!

He's deigning to come to us, huh?

Jheese, the one you let get away, is bringing Commander Ginyu back with him.

I don't care how good you are, you're going to have your hands full this time.

Him, huh? He's trouble, all right, Goku.

Hang on, where's Freeza?

He should be at his spaceship, after Ginyu delivered the Dragon Balls to him.

Well, he ain't there now.

I can sense a strong Ki, way off in that direction.

That's probably Freeza.

B-But that direction is...!

O-Oh, no! That's where the Grand Elder is!

Grand Elder?

That's it! Freeza couldn't get his wish granted, so he went to ask a Namekian personally how to do it!

What?! Are you saying he went to find out the password, or whatever?!

By any chance, is he the one who created the Dragon Balls here?

Yeah, the Grand Elder.

This is bad.

O-Once he finds out how to have his wish granted, he's sure to kill the Grand Elder and the others!

He doesn't know that if the Grand Elder dies, the Dragon Balls will be gone!

W-What?!

They're here!

You went and made real fools of us earlier, didn't you?

The commander has come here personally to punish you!

Well, Goku? Can you beat this guy, too?

I won't know until I try.

This guy's power is in a league all its own, after all.

So, that's the guy, huh?

A battle power of roughly 5,000.

That's right. Just 5,000. Strange, isn't it?

You idiot!

The reason you got made fools of is because you only paid attention to his Scouter rating.

I have no doubt that he momentarily raised his battle power significantly.

That's the type of fighter he is.

By my estimation, I'm guessing his battle power is about 60,000 .

-60,000?! But he's a Saiyan!

I've never heard of a Saiyan reaching 60,000!

It's not impossible.
He's probably an ultra-gifted warrior who, like ourselves, came about as the result of some mutation.

This looks like it's going to be a fight more interesting than any I've ever been in.

I never thought that I, Ginyu, would ever have to show off my true power.

I'll keep this guy contained.

You guys use the Dragon Radar, and find the Balls.

They're probably right next to their spaceship.

If I'm able to defeat these guys, I'll be coming right away.

Don't go talking about "ifs"!
You make sure you defeat them!

--Yeah.
--All right, let's go!

We have to be quick, or the Grand Elder will be dead!

There already might not be time!

Just hurry.

Vegeta, you take care of the other one.

You've recovered from being near death, so your power should have gone up sharply.

He's no longer an opponent you can't handle, right?

You know about that, huh?

All right, get going! Be careful!

--We're off!
--Good luck, Goku!

Th-They're getting away!

Let them be. They're small fry.

All right, let's get going ourselves.

Not much choice, is there?

Catch you later, Kakarrot!

Vegeta!

You're wide open!

Ow... Damn that Vegeta...

So, you are even better than I thought.

All the more reason why Vegeta running off on you must hurt.

I have to settle this quickly, or else the hope that we found will all be for nothing.

This is a welcome development.

The way I see it, Kakarrot and Ginyu's powers are about the same.

If I'm lucky, the two of them might just eliminate each other.

If they do, I can't lose.

Once I find out from those runts the password to get my wish granted,

I'll wipe them out immediately.

Then, once I become immortal, it will mean that I have a chance to defeat Freeza in battle.

It's true, you do have impressive speed for a Saiyan.

Ginyu Special Corps! Commander Ginyu!

Ultra Fighting Pose!!

Like this?

Y-You fool! Your legs! Your legs are reversed!

Oh, right.

You know, you guys all have the strangest stances.

W-What did you say?!

C-Can't you see the splendor of my Ultra Fighting Pose?!

Whatever. I ain't got much time.

I hate to ruin your big appearance, but I'm gonna end this with one burst.

Oh, aren't you sure of yourself?

I, Ginyu, have never been spoken to like this.

If you had shown that self-assuredness when we were squaring off earlier, I would have taken you down a peg right away.

The truth is, I'm the same type as you are, and can control my battle power at will.

Th-That's our Commander Ginyu.
He isn't flustered in the least.

Of course not. Even if his battle power really is 60,000.

Commander Ginyu's maximum battle power is still much higher.

Yikes!

Aww... First the spaceship is wrecked, and I can't get back to Earth, then the communicator gets broken.
Nothing is going my way!

All right, it's fixed. That sure did take a lot of time and trouble.

W-What was that just now?

A-All seven of them are together, aren't they?

I'll bet they're all about to summon Shen Long, and have their wish granted without me! All right, then...

But if Vegeta is the one who's gotten the Dragon Balls together...

Again?! What is wrong with this planet?!

I know! Even if it is Vegeta, I can just say "send me back to Earth" before he can do anything!

Oh, that's easy, huh?

With that settled, I'm off to find the Dragon Balls.

Let's go!

He's fast! Does he have more speed than I do?!

C-Crap!

I managed to stop him cold for you!

Damn it...!

Commander! He's all ours now!

Damn... he's got tremendous power...! I can't get loose...

Commander! Break his bones already, and let's knock him out!

I-I've got no choice but to use Kaio-ken at this point...

C-Commander?!

Who asked you for any help, Jheese?!

C-Commander...

The next time you butt in, consider yourself the one who will be losing his life!

Y-Yes, sir.

And as for you...

You're still hiding some of your true power.

Did you really think I wouldn't notice?

You're probably thinking of saving it for a showdown with Freeza-sama, looking forward to a fight you don't get to enjoy very often. 
Enough of your two-bit sham.

All right, you got it.
I'll show you my true power!

That's better.

It's not worth dying if you get killed before you use up all your power.

Take a good look at my power rating, using that device you've got that can tell an opponent's power!

I don't need to use my Scouter.

Your rating will probably only go up to 85,000.

Kaio-ken!!

-85,000...

90,000...95,000...

100,000... 105,000...110,000...

I-impossible!

111,000!

112,000! This can't be!

I-It's still climbing!


Son Goku at Full Power! There's a Secret Plan in the Shaking Ginyu!?"   




-116,000... 117,000...

-118,000...!

-119,000! This can't be!

-120,000!

U-Unbelievable! This is your true power?!

N-No wonder we couldn't beat him.
How can a Saiyan be so strong?

Let me be clear.

This still ain't the sort of power I can put out for short moments.

W-What?!

D-Don't tell me...

Don't tell me you're a...

...S-Super Saiyan?!

That's what Vegeta was saying, too.

But I've got no idea what it means.

A Super Saiyan?
The all-powerful warrior of legend?!

How can that be?!

He's... he's...a Super Saiyan, the one thing that Freeza-sama fears?!

I hate to say it, but you can't beat me.

I want to avoid any unnecessary fighting.

You guys, get off of this planet!

What? Do you seriously mean that?

I mean it.

Especially with you being a warrior who fights fairer than I expected.

I don't want to kill you.

You don't want to kill me?

He says he wants to avoid unnecessary fighting?

Get off of this planet?

A-A Super Saiyan is supposed to be the mightiest warrior in the universe, one who relishes blood and battle.

Then that's it!

You are not a Super Saiyan, are you?

You have not fully become a Super Saiyan!

I see, so you are not a Super Saiyan.

You don't say.

Grand Elder, it's Nail-san!

Why have you returned? I ordered you to help the earthlings, did I not?

I am terribly sorry, but with respect, my ultimate duty is to defend your life, Grand Elder.

But...

Grand Elder, if you die, the Dragon Balls will disappear, too.

If that happens, the earthlings will not have their wish granted.

There it is!

Bulma-san!

We need the Dragon Radar!

Bulma-san!

Geez... Every moment counts, but right when we really need her, she's never around.

Kuririn-san, over here.

That's a jet-bike track.

Where could Bulma-san have gone on a jet-bike?

Let's go after her! We have to get the Radar from her and find the Balls before we run out of time!

Right!

That must be it.

Sure enough, they've finally gotten wind of this place.

They're almost here.

Dende, come here.

Right.

Now go, Dende.

The earthlings need you.
I have drawn out your power, so you should reach them in a short amount of time.

--B-But...
--Hurry and get going.

Very well. Grand Elder, please don't die.

Will I be killed first, or will my time come first?

No matter. I will leave the speck of dust alone.

He is here.

Do you want something?

My name is Freeza, and I have a certain wish that I would like to have granted with the Dragon Balls.

I have gotten all seven of them together, but I just cannot seem to have my wish granted.

And so, I would like you to tell me...

What shall I do to have my wish granted?

I must ask you to leave. I cannot tell that to someone who is evil.

I think it would be better for you to be more amiable.

There is no reason for me not to kill you.

There are two of you here, right?

I can get my answer from either one of you.

Then that's what you should do.

But before we fight, I will tell you this much: The other one, inside the house, is the Grand Elder of the Namekians.

The Dragon Balls were created by the Grand Elder.

Now listen, and get this into your head: If you kill the Grand Elder, the Dragon Balls will disappear, too.

Grand Elder...?

Hmm, indeed.

You appear to be telling the truth.

He is indeed different from the other Namekians.

Grand Elder, I suppose you have no intention of telling me, either.

However, I doubt you will be able to keep it from me once this man is on the verge of dying.

Nail will not be defeated as easily as you think.

He is the strongest warrior-type Namekian on the planet.

He is not like the other Namekians you have killed up to now.

Apparently, you do not wish to tell me, no matter what.

It is in your hands, Nail.
Please buy as much time as you can.

Understood.

Very well. if you are going to be this unkind, I will show you how terrifying I, the greatest warrior in the universe, can be!

As you have probably noticed...the Grand Elder's life is near its end.

If we fight here, and he is caught in the crossfire, it will not serve you, either.

Let's change locations.

I doubt that the battle will become that serious, but very well.

Wherever you like.

Forgive me, Nail.

Please, try to hold out at least until Dende reaches the earthlings.

At this point, the fate of this world is in their hands.

What are you laughing at?

How can I not laugh, with someone as strong as you are here?

So why are you laughing?

Because I, Ginyu, am so glad that I've met someone so much stronger than I am!

--Jheese!
--Y-Yes, sir!

S-So that's it! Commander Ginyu is about to...

Hold on tight to my Scouter, so that you don't drop it.

That's it, all right.

How far are we going?

Enough, already!

There is no need to go any farther than this!

Right.

My, my, there certainly are a lot of people on this planet who want to die. What is a person to do?

This is amazing. Your battle power has risen to 42,000.

I see. You truly do seem to be different from the other Namekians up to now.

You have surprised me. That is an outstanding battle power.

I can see why you would be called a warrior-type.

Enough that I would like you as one of my own.

However, just for your information, as the opponent you are about to fight, shall I first inform you of my battle power?

My battle power......is 530,000.

However, you need not worry.

I do not, of course, plan to fight you with my full power.

What?!

I know. I will fight using only my left arm for you.

That might be somewhat entertaining.

Enough!

That will not do, will it?

And here I stretched out my neck for you, so you would be certain to hit it, and this is the best you have?

Oh, but then, at 42,000.
I suppose that is to be expected.

Oh my, that was quite unmannerly of me.

I will return it to you.

It might be better for you not to strain yourself, might it not?

I do think that it would be best if you told me, before you get killed.

Oh, this is a surprise!

You can regenerate yourself?

However, while you may be back to normal, your plight is the same.

It seems you are unable to regenerate your strength, though.

Your battle power has fallen.

My, my, even after being shown how great a difference there is between you and me, you still wish to continue?

My word, I have absolutely no idea what the people of this world are thinking.

I won't let you...

I won't let you...!

What is this?! What?!

Does this planet have something against me?!

This time I've had it for sure!

Lucky! If I can make it inside that cave...

A little farther...

I-I made it! I'm saved!

H-Huh? Am I saved?

You meanie! You meanie!

I'm done for sure now!

Farewell, everyone!

Ow!

Eh? What? What happened?

No! Stay back! You perv!
You letch! You idiot! You fiend!

--You moron! You sicko!
--B-Bulma-san!

G-Gohan-kun...? Th-Then...

Th-That was mean, Bulma-san.

What are you guys up to?!

No sooner do you show up out of nowhere with Vegeta and take the Dragon Ball, than you head off again somewhere else!

Just what is going on here?!

Do you think you can get away with leaving a delicate young lady all alone in a dangerous place like this?!

Y-Yeah, but we just saved you from those dinosaurs, didn't we?

B-Bulma-san, we need the Dragon Radar!

If we're lucky, we can get our wish granted!

What?! You still haven't gotten our wish granted?!

I saw on the Radar that all seven of them were together, so I figured you had collected them all, and I was on my way over!

And what is this now?!

Good grief. What are you dilly-dallying around for?

D-Dilly-dallying. Right.

Bulma-san, excuse me.

Kuririn-san, I found them!
They're in that direction!

All right, let's go!

Hey! Tell me what's going on!

We're in a hurry now, so we'll tell you later!

Bulma-san, please wait for us back on that island!

Huh?! You've gotta be kidding me!
Do you expect me to walk back?!

What is this! What is this?!

Oh, yeah! Father is here!

Eh? Really?

So, how about it?
Has he gotten even stronger?

Gohan, let's hurry!

Right!

Son-kun, huh?

I never thought he'd grow up to be so dashing.

Yamucha's supposed to be my boyfriend, and all we ever do is fight.

Maybe I missed the boat.

W-What are you...?!

What the...?

Y-You may not be... a Super Saiyan...

...b-but I like... that strong body of yours...

Y-You like it?

S-Sure enough, Commander Ginyu is going to do it.

I-Incredible. Where in that body of his did he get this much power?

H-Here it comes...

Ch-Change!!


Surprise! Goku is Ginyu and Ginyu is Goku?!
  


Why... am I... over there...?!

I've made a switch.

Your body for mine!

Th-That can't be right!

Commander Ginyu...

Your Scouter.

All right, let's go back to the spaceship.

Freeza-sama might be back already.

Yes, sir!


This body is even faster!

I-I can't move...

So this is the reason why he injured himself, is it?

O-Oh, no! The way things are going, I-- I mean, they, and Kuririn and Gohan are gonna run into each other!

R-Rats, not only ain't I familiar with this body, I'm injured, too. I can't fly very well.

What's more, even if I'm lucky enough to get back to Earth, Chichi's probably gonna yell at me again.

What with the face I've got now...

What am I gonna do?

Hmph, looks like Freeza is away, all right.

W-What?!

So this is a 180,000-power body, is it?!

Still, I think my last face was more handsome.

--Huh, Jheese?
--Yes, absolutely, sir!

I-I have to hurry, or Kuririn and Gohan are gonna get killed!

This way...? No, that way.

Ribbit... ribbit, ribbit... ribbit...

Damn it, I can't even keep my balance very well in this body!

Damn you, Freeza. Seeing as how Ginyu stayed behind, the Dragon Balls have to be around here somewhere.

Whatever the case, those earthlings are going to find them using that strange device of theirs.

They will be along shortly.

I guess I'll trade in my battle suit for a newer one now, while I can.

I have to say, Kakarrot uses a most unusual medicine.

Not only does it heal injuries, but it also completely restores one's strength.

Tch, they've only got the older type in my size, huh?

Kuririn-san, over there!

Got it. That's their spaceship, is it?

There you are, earthlings.

It won't do to let them know I'm here.

I'll have to mask my battle power, the way they do.

Let's hurry up and find them.
It doesn't look like anyone's here.

Kuririn-san, wait!

The Dragon Ball readings on the Radar aren't coming from inside the ship, they're slightly away from it.

Where are they, Gohan?

Let's see, over here.

Right here, Kuririn-san. Right here.

Now that you mention it, it looks like something was buried here.

They put them here?

All right, let's dig them up!

Right!

There it is! There it is!

There's one here, too!

All right! Here's one, too!

Wow, it looks like all seven of them are here!

That's where they hid them?!

We've got them! We've got them all!

All right, now call forth this "Shen Long."

I'll dispose of you, and have my wish of eternal youth and life granted!

Hooray!

We worked hard for this, huh?

Yes. Now, Piccolo-san and the others can finally come back to life.

Now, do it! Call it out!

All right, here goes. We came all the way here for this moment.

Let's have a look at the home soil's Shen Long!

Right.

Come forth, Shen Long, and grant us our wish!

The cue was that simple?!

W-What's going on?
Isn't something supposed to happen?

Just what is this "Shen Long"?

H-He didn't come out.

Shen Long didn't come out!

How come Shen Long didn't come whooshing out?!

Maybe the phrasing is a little bit different.

--Th-Then maybe, "Shen Long, come forth!"
--Damn it...

--No, maybe "Grant my wish!
Come forth, Shen Long!"
--What are they doing?!

That's strange...

Kuririn-san, somebody is headed this way!

Hey, I'm sensing two Ki!

Could it be those "Ginyu" guys from earlier?

Th-Then, Father was beaten by him?

Tch, this is going to be a lot of trouble again.

It's an evil Ki! No doubt about it, it's those guys from earlier.

W-What's happened to Goku?

Mask your Ki and hide, Gohan!

Right!

The Dragon Balls have been dug up!

What's the meaning of this?

How did they know where they were buried?

Goku!

It's me! it's me! You sure gave me a start!

"That Ginyu guy," I thought!
"It's that Ginyu guy!"

I didn't realize that you'd defeated him, and gotten his man to join our side.

Are you the one who found these Dragon Balls?

How did you know they were here?

Don't be silly, Goku.

We found them with the Dragon Radar, of course.

Radar, did he say?

Damn, they've got something like that?

So did you get your wish granted?

That's the thing. it didn't work.

Shen Long didn't come out. I wonder why.

Maybe the incantation is different from what it is on Earth.

I see. it didn't work, then?

Goku...? ls there something the matter with you?

How can I put this?
Something feels kind of... off...

Moreover, why are you wearing their Scouter whatchamacallit thing?

You really want to know?

Kuririn-san! That's not my father!

Kuririn-san, run!

There's another one of them, is there?

There wasn't any reading on the Scouter.

Apparently, they can control their battle power down to zero.

W-What did you do that for, Goku?!

I-It's not Father! That is not my father!

Th-That's not Goku? What do you mean?

Any way you look at it, that's...

I-I don't know. But, I can tell.

I've traded bodies with him.

This one is much stronger, after all.

W-What did you say?!

H-He traded bodies?!

That's right.

The Ginyu Special Corps' Red Magma...

Jheese!

And I am... the Ginyu Special Corps' commander...

Ginyu-sama!

Y-You switched bodies with him?!
That's impossible!

Now then, why don't I give it a test drive--the incredible battle power that reaches over 180,000!

S-Stop it, Goku! Y-You're being controlled!

It's hypnosis, or something!

Whether his body has been switched, or he's under hypnosis, it still doesn't change Kakarrot's strength.

Things are getting even worse.

R-Rats, with this unfamiliar body, I ain't able to sense Ki too well.

Unfamiliar body? That's right!

If I ain't used to this body, then he can't be too used to my body, either!

I'm just getting started!

I'm going to raise my power higher and higher!

Are you ready?!

Commander Ginyu!
That punk has followed us here!

What?

I've found you!

I'm impressed you made it this far!

I should have made that wound even worse!

K-Kuririn! Gohan! Listen to me!

That ain't me! He's switched bodies with me!

Y-You mean, it's for real?!

Th-Th-This can't be!

That's Father?!

Yahoo!

Wow! Yum, yum!

I-I couldn't take that!

That's Ginyu! Don't hesitate to beat him up!

There's no way you guys can be beaten by him!

Listen to me! Give that guy a thrashing!

G-Give him a thrashing?

You fool! There's no way they can be beaten by me, huh?

This used to be your body! 
Its battle power is over 180,000!

There's no chance of them beating me!

Just try it, you'll see.

Th-That's my body.
You think you can control its Ki, let alone perform Kaio-ken?

Unless the mind and body are in harmony, you ain't gonna produce all that much power!

Your bluffs aren't going to work against me, Ginyu!

I'll show you what my battle power is now!

--Jheese!
--Yes, sir!

Jheese! How high is my battle power?!

-23,000, sir...

What?! I couldn't hear you!

it's... 23...

23,000, sir!

Well?! Did you hear that?!

It's only 23,000! Only that much!

How come?

H-How come...?

-23,000...?

Only 23,000, you say?

That's my body!

Like I said, your body and spirit have to be in harmony, or you ain't gonna produce all that much power!

Kuririn! Gohan! You can beat him now!

I-Impossible! This is impossible!

It's true! We just might be able to beat him like this!

Let's go, Gohan!

R-Right!

Now, Gohan!

What's the matter, Gohan?!

Father...

Gohan!

What's wrong with you, Gohan?!

S-Sorry. For a moment, it seemed like it really was Father.

I know what you mean.
It feels the same way to me, too.

But that isn't Goku. it's Ginyu. Got it?

Gohan! Kuririn!

All right, I'll get him this time!

Let's go!

Jheese!

What are you waiting for?!
You start fighting, too!

Y-Yes, sir!

Whoa...

You get to face me.

Vegeta...

Damn it!

You think that flimsy attack will work against me?!

W-Why is this?

Th-This body is supposed to be able to generate a power above 180,000!

Didn't you hear what Goku said a moment ago?

You aren't able to use that body very well.

Why don't you surrender now, while you can?

S-Surrender? Me, Ginyu, surrender?

You must be joking!

Damn it!

You've got some nerve, challenging me to battle at your level!

Just keep on blathering all you like.

How did you hide from us?!

There was no hint of a signal from you on my Scouter!

You guys rely on your Scouters too much.

You'll understand that well, once you fight those guys from Earth!

But then, you're going to end up dying here.

Don't be ridiculous!
The Ginyu Special Corps is made up of a collection of the universe's super-elite fighters!

There's no way a simian punk like you can stand up to me!

And yet even as you say so, you're afraid, aren't you?

Afraid of my rejuvenated power?

What?!

Take a good look at me, with that much-beloved Scouter of yours.

Afraid of you, you say?

Me, afraid of the likes of your battle power, Vegeta?

I-Impossible...

Damn it!

It's broken!

Do you really think it's malfunctioning?

W-Why, you...

I've become stronger every time I've returned from the brink of death.

And, after surpassing the limits of the Saiyan race, I've added even more strength.

The truth is, I've just now realized something myself--

The growth of my power is not just due to me being gifted.

Or in other words, I'm quickly getting closer, myself...to becoming a Super Saiyan.

D-Don't give me that crap!

A Super Saiyan is the mightiest of warriors, delighting in blood and battle.

Kakarrot might not be able to become one, since he's not hard-hearted enough, but I'm not like him!

II-Impossible!

S-Spare me...


A Great Turnabout for Goku?! Super Shenlong, Come Out Right Now!"   


Vegeta! You didn't have to take it that far!

You just spout that naive gibberish all you like, Kakarrot.

You'll never be a Super Saiyan for as long as you live.

I'm the only one who's cut out for that!

What?! Did you say Super Saiyan?!

Haven't you taken care of Ginyu yet?

All right, I'll dispose of him.

Move it!

I-Incredible...

Now to finish the job!

W-Why, you...!

Th-That's enough! Don't kill him, Vegeta!

Die!!

I-It can't be...!

Change!!

This is it! I can get back to my old self!

Let me be in time!

W-What?! Move it!

Damn! That bastard!
How dare he... get in the way...?!

Yow-ow-ow-ow...

Looks like I made it back.

W-What was that? What the hell did Kakarrot do just now?!

W-What was that light just now?

D-Did Goku just jump in there to stop Vegeta's attack?

I can sense Father!

Father has... Father has returned to his original body!

--What?!
--Are you sure, Gohan?

S-So then, now, that Ginyu bastard is over there?

D-Damn...

This time, I'll Change with Vegeta for sure!

That body is all mine!

Th-This is bad... if we let him have Vegeta's body now...it's all over...!

Change!!

Ribbit, ribbit...

He's letting himself get injured, like he did with me, before he switches places with Vegeta...

What's the matter? Is it over already?

That's right! it's all over...for you!

Stop, Vegeta!

You fell for it, Vegeta!

Ribbit, ribbit... ribbit...

--That's it!
--Change!!

N-Now what?

Ribbit... ribbit...Ribbit... ribbit, ribbit...ribbit... ribbit, ribbit...

I-I did it...

G-Goku, are you all right?!

Father, shake it off!

Y-You sure roughed up my body good, huh, Vegeta?

Hmph! Never mind you, tell me what the hell happened to Ginyu.

What just ran away from us was a frog...

What's more, that frog-looking thing over there is Ginyu...

What?

Ribbit... ribbit...

Hmm, I don't know what you did, but I'm still going to stomp on you.

Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit, ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit!

Leave him alone, Vegeta...

Ginyu ain't able to do nothing now that he's like that...

Tch, okay, fine. I guess I'll let you go.

I have to feel sorry for you, with the life you've got ahead of you.

--Goku!
--Father!

Hey, Goku, don't you even have a single senzu bean left?

N-No... I don't know what to do...

There's nothing stopping me from wiping out you pests now, huh?

What?!

Vegeta... you wouldn't...

I-it's all right... He can't kill us just yet...

He's right. There is the matter of the Dragon Balls, but I'm also going to need your strength, particularly that of Kakarrot, to fight Freeza.

--Come on.
--Where to?

Inside the spaceship. Bring Kakarrot with you.

W-What are you going to do with Goku?

I'm going to treat his injuries.

How are we supposed to believe you?!

Hmph, then suit yourselves.
You can die by the wayside there.

Damn it.

Kuririn-san...

Let's go, Kuririn-san.

Okay.

Make it quick! There's no telling when Freeza will be coming back.

We'll use this to treat Kakarrot and return him to full power.

W-With that...?

Vegeta, what is this?

It's called a Medical Machine.
In short, it's like a healing capsule.

By submerging him in the special fluid in here, he will recover his strength in a short length of time.

Hmm, in this stuff, huh?

After we've defeated Freeza, I'll deal with you guys, nice and easy.

By then, I have no doubt, I will have become a Super Saiyan.

The Medical Machine in this room is an older type, but knowing Kakarrot, he should be completely recovered in not too much time.

Older type?

I busted up the newer one.

H-He's not gonna drown or anything in there, right?

This feels great.

Now then, I think I'll get you guys some battle wear.

It will at least improve your defense a little bit.

Battle wear? You mean like yours?

That won't be good for our image, huh?

Wow, their civilization is a lot more advanced than Earth's, huh?

It sure does look that way.

Strip out of your clothes and put those undershirts on.

Make it quick. Freeza will be coming.

Listen, Gohan, Vegeta even needs our help with this one...which means that this Freeza guy is awfully strong, huh?

That scares me.

Now for your battle jackets.

Luckily, they have some tiny-sized ones the Littians use.

How are we supposed to put these on?

Once we get them over our heads, our arms won't fit through.

Just force them on.

Those are flexible, and if you pull on them, they stretch easily.

When I turned Great Ape back on Earth, mine didn't tear, remember?

What's more, they are impact resistant.

Ah, amazing! You're right!

Are the gloves and boots made of the same material?

Yeah, sure.

Whoa, these are amazingly light!

They feel almost weightless!

It's no fair, you guys wearing something as nice as this.

Huh, Vegeta...?

I'd rather have something like you're wearing, Vegeta.

I mean, the shoulders look easier to move around in.

This is an older style.

They didn't have anything newer in my base size.

Then again, these don't get in the way at all, Kuririn-san.

I can move freely!

By the way, about how long will it take for Goku to heal?

Good question.

Knowing him, he should completely recover in 50 to 60  minutes.

Gohan, I'm going to go to the Grand Elder's place.

It's possible that Freeza is there, but we have to ask the Grand Elder for the words to summon Shen Long, or we're not gonna get anywhere.

I-I'll go, too.

No, I can handle this alone. Wait here for me.

I am only using my left hand, and look at you.

There is no way you can beat me like this.

How about telling me the way to get the Dragon Balls to grant wishes, already?

You keep on expending this wasted effort.

There is no way something like that will work against me.

You must realize that by now, do you not?

I cannot understand why you continue to defy me, when you know that you will lose.

Is it because your friends have been killed?

Or could it be out of simple obstinacy?

Let me make this my final warning.

Tell me how to get the Dragon Balls to grant my wish...or you will die.

E-Even if you were to find out, it won't do you any good.

D-Dende will reach the earthlings...a-any moment now...t-to tell them the very words that you want to know...

W-What?!

Him...?

Why, you...! You were just buying time for him?!

I-Imagine, things turning out this way...

I should have told the earthlings the right words when they were here.

I-I've made Nail go through that terrible ordeal.

P-Please hurry, Dende.

I-It seems my time is drawing near.

I have to tell Kuririn and the others about the password, as fast as I can!

Hey, you!

Keep a close eye on the Dragon Balls.

I'm going to go take a nap inside the spaceship.

Wake me up when he gets back.

A nap?

I haven't had any sleep this whole time.

Freeza could be coming at any time. How can he sleep?

The Ginyu Special Corps' readings are gone!

Are you telling me that all five of them have been beaten?!

W-Whatever the case, something has happened between Vegeta, the earthlings, and the Ginyu Special Corps!

A-And what about the Dragon Balls?!

Curse you! it will be I, Freeza, that has his wish granted!

Not you inferior life forms!

A Ki.

Something is flying toward Goku and the others.

Th-This Ki belongs to...

it's Dende, all right!

Hey!

It's me, it's me! And yes, I am wearing this outfit!

K-Kuririn-san!

--Thank goodness!
--Thank goodness!

It will probably take Kuririn-san about two hours to go to the Grand Elder's place and back.

What do I do if Freeza comes here during that time?

Wow, this really does help.
We've got all the Dragon Balls together, but Shen Long won't come out, so I was headed to see the Grand Elder to ask him what the password was.

I thought you were.

The Grand Elder told me to tell you how to have your wish granted.

Oh, yeah? So, what are we supposed to say?

You have to speak in the Namekian language, or else your wish won't be granted.

Namekian, huh? I should have known.

The Grand Elder isn't very good with others, huh?

He could have told us that when we were there.

He probably never thought that you'd be able to get them all together.

Oh, yeah.

Never mind that, let's hurry.
The Grand Elder's time is drawing near.

What's more, Freeza might be coming any minute.

Oh, yeah, right.

Hmm? Something's coming.

Is it Kuririn-san? But I sense two Ki...

Huh? They've masked their Ki!

It's Kuririn-san, all right!

And the other one is...

...Dende-kun! Hooray!

Fantastic! it's Gohan!

Thank goodness!

That was incredibly fast, huh?
How did you do that?

Oh, Dende was asked by the Grand Elder to come to us.

To tell us how to get the Dragon Balls to grant our wish?

Yes!

By the way, where's Vegeta?

I masked my Ki before I got here, so he wouldn't know we were coming.

I don't think he's noticed.
He said he hadn't had any sleep lately, and went to go to sleep inside the spaceship.

All right, we're in luck!

Now, let's quietly bring the Dragon Balls over here, so that Vegeta doesn't realize what we're doing.

Then, even if he notices that Shen Long has emerged, we'll have bought ourselves a little time.

--Mm-hmm.
--Right.

Yahoo! We did it!

Okay, it's up to you now, Dende.

Right.

Kuririn-san, something is coming this way! A-At incredible speed!

I-It's Freeza!

Quickly, Dende!
Hurry and get our wish granted!

R-Right!

Takkaraputo Poppolunga pupirito paro!

N-Nothing happened.

Hey, Dende, are you sure you didn't goof up the password?

Th-They're glowing!

Th-The sky has gotten dark!

J-Just like the Dragon Balls on Earth!


An Enraged Freeza Approaches! Porunga... Please Grant Our Wish!"   


H-H-He's huge!

And he has a different shape than Earth's Shen Long.

Th-That's Shen... Long...?

He's called "Polunga" here.
It means "God of Dreams."

This is the first time I've seen him, myself.

Oh, it looks like their wishes are about to be granted!

All right!

At last, we'll be brought back to life.

Good for you, Ten-san!

Thou who hast gathered the Dragon Balls, now, speak forth thy wishes.

I shall grant thee any three wishes that are within my capacity.

A-Awesome! He really does grant three wishes!

That's the homeland's Shen Long for you! Nice and generous!

W-What do we do? We have three of them!

Y-Your wishes, quickly!
Freeza or Vegeta could be...

A-Ah, r-right!

First, ask him to bring back to life all of the people on Earth who were killed by the Saiyans.

R-Right, understood!

Bandappulula lutemilar fanpalitsu pumelett hero lunchelo itachikonchipa pontelo lupiche!

I cannot grant that wish.

I am able to bring only one person back to life at a time.

O-Oh, no!

Apparently, they can only bring one of you back to life at a time.

O-One at a time?!

Now then, speak thy wishes.

I shall grant thee any three wishes that are within my capacity.

W-Within his capacity?

H-Hurry! We'll be in real trouble if Vegeta or Freeza finds us!

What do we do? We can only bring back one person per wish!

Th-This is a tough one.
Who exactly should we ask for?

Damn it! For the homeland's Shen Long, that's not very generous.

Kaio, I'm begging you!

You want to speak to Goku's son?
What are you planning, Piccolo?

Hurry it up, I beg you!

A-All right, you got it. Place your hand on my shoulder and speak.

Gohan! Do you hear me?! it's me! Piccolo!

Gohan!

Gohan!!

Answer me, Gohan! it's me, Piccolo!

P-Piccolo?! it couldn't be!

Where are you, Piccolo-san?

I'm speaking directly into your hearts through Kaio.

Don't drop my honorific.
Call me Kaio-sama! Kaio-sama!

I-Into our hearts?

I know that you can have three wishes granted, but you can only have one person brought back to life per wish!

Listen closely! With your first wish, bring me back to life!

--Hold on!
--We won't let you get away with that, Piccolo!

Shut up!

Listen up. Once I'm back to life, Kami will come back to life, too.

Once that happens, the Dragon Balls on Earth will return, and the others here can then be brought back to life, too!

That's right! I didn't think of that!

U-Understood, Piccolo-san!

I get it. So that's the idea.

--Nice thinking.
--Piccolo, you're amazing!

And now, I'll tell you the second wish.

Have me... Once I'm resurrected, have me sent to Planet Namek, where you guys are!

L... I want to fight!

Against that bastard Freeza, who killed those who are my people, there in the land of my birth!

What are you saying, Piccolo?!

I've gained a lot more strength here!

I will defeat him for sure, just watch!

Summon me to that planet! Got it?!

A-All right, Piccolo-san!

I'm counting on you. Do whatever you want with the third wish.

Right! Piccolo-san, once you get here, I'll really be happy!

See here, Piccolo!

Have you forgotten your promise to me?!

You said you would never fight Freeza!

What can I say? I don't remember any such promise.

What did you say?!

Unfortunately, I have a poor memory.

Why, you...!

--Now, now, Kaio-sama...
--Calm down a little bit.

--Let me go! How dare you people do this to me?
--Please, take it nice and easy.

I don't know who this punk is, but I, Piccolo, will defeat him, no matter what!

You guys don't have any idea how fearsome Freeza is!

Now let me go! I can't talk to you like this, you know!

All right!

Let's get those two wishes granted first!

--Right!
--Dende!

Y-Yes?

Ask him to bring the Namekian named Piccolo, who was on Earth, back to life!

P-Piccolo-san, you say? All right!

Piccolo-san is about to come back...

W-What's that?! Something's approaching!

A tremendous battle power!

F-Freeza!

It will take several more minutes before Kakarrot is back in action.

It will be a real pain if Freeza shows up now.

Damn it, I have a bad feeling about this!

What?!

W-What's going on here?! it's night out!

What the...? There's not supposed to be any night on this world!

W-Why is the sky so dark?!

I-Is this...?

I-It couldn't be!

It couldn't be... It couldn't be...

It couldn't be!

Tetorapto potto Piccolo pupimelopa pimoposo partola temolimpe cooli coopasu puyaccliguo wotoku holakusa pelopuppo!

Very well.

I shall grant thy first wish.

Oh, crap! The Dragon Balls are gone!

Damn it! Kakarrot's son is gone, too!

Why, that dirty little brat!

What is that monster?

Is that monster the dragon of the Dragon Balls that they mentioned?!

Damn it! Those dirty brats got the jump on me!

They'll pay for this!!

Th-This is bad. That Freeza bastard is also coming up on them!

There are four life signs.

I've finally found you!
Just you wait, you inferior life forms!

Ah, it vanished!

Good!

I'm alive again! Now, for the next wish!

I'm counting on you, Gohan!

I don't care anymore!
I really don't care anymore!

Hold it! Hold it, hold it!

K-Kami-sama...!

Piccolo, you rascal!
That was some smart thinking.

Popo, thanks for keeping an eye on things here.

Thank goodness! Kami-sama, so happy you come back to life!

Thy first wish is granted.

Now, speak forth thy second wish.

Our second wish is to please warp Piccolo-san, who we just had brought back to life, here to Planet Namek!

R-Right!

Dende, make it fast! Vegeta has found us out!

R-Right! Telmopara accoloru tsuteno lipilo Piccoloru magake tapaccoloru!

That is an easily granted wish.

I shall grant thy second wish.

That miserable fool!

Thy second wish has been granted.

Now, speak forth thy final wish.

It's been granted? But Piccolo isn't here, is he?

Where are you, Piccolo-san?!

Y-You just said to please bring him to this world, so he has to be here somewhere.

Y-You wanted him to come here?

O-Oh, no!

W-What do we do? Use the third wish to bring him here, or...

V-Vegeta!

I knew it... I knew that's what this was!

How dare you?! How dare you pull the rug out from under Vegeta?!

You will pay for this!

You fools! You've wasted the one means by which we can defeat Freeza!

The only way to beat him was to make me immortal!

You filthy pieces of scum!

Wait! We've only had two wishes granted!

There's still one more wish that can be granted!

You idiot! Don't tell him that!

I'm relieved to hear that.

What is that column of light?

The life sign readings are coming from there, too.

N-No way! They can't be using the Dragon Balls to get their wish!

What is thy third wish?

Okay, make me immortal! Do it now!

You little brat!

Don't you understand what I mean by "do it now"?!

Dende!

Hurry it up! Freeza is already on top of us!

I can't breathe!

I-If that wish gets granted...

But we don't have any choice but to do it!

It will take a while longer for Father's injuries to heal.

So this is my homeland...

Planet Namek, huh?

I see. it feels strangely familiar.

Is it the Namekian blood that flows within me that is making me feel like this?

Whoa, this is no time to be caught up in my emotions.

I have to find Gohan and the others.

Damn it, where are they?!

It doesn't look like they're anywhere nearby.

W-What's that?!

I sense a ridiculously huge Ki, far away!

I-Is it that "Freeza" monster?

There are three other Ki near him.
It's Gohan and the others!

All right, just sit tight, Gohan!

Hast thou thy third wish yet? Speak it now.

What are you waiting for?! Tell him, now!

Make me immortal, right this instant!

Do you want to be killed by Freeza?!

K-Kuririn-san! Freeza is almost here!

At this point, it's all-or-nothing!

Dende! Let him have his wish granted!

V-Vegeta may be incredibly evil, but he's still better than Freeza!

I hate to say it, but right now, there's no other way out of this crisis!

U-Understood...

All right. That's better.

Okay, do it now.

R-Right.

--Stop stalling!
--R-Right!

Good! Now Freeza won't be able to kill me!

Even if I can't beat him now, as long as I keep laying into him, I'm sure to defeat him before too long!

P-Papritto...

Here it comes!

The moment when I, Vegeta, will rule the universe, is here!

Papritto...Vegeta capolasuyo...pelnettolu...

W-What's going on?!

W-What happened?!

Why did the dragon disappear, and the sky turn bright again?!

Why did the Dragon Balls turn to stone?!

Th-The Grand Elder has...

--Dende...
--The Grand Elder has...passed away.

Y-You're kidding...

The Grand Elder, the one who created the Dragon Balls, has reached the end of his life.

W-What did you say?! You filthy brat!

What about me?! What about my immortality?!

W-Well...

Why, you...!

If you hadn't circumvented me, we wouldn't be in this situation!

You'll pay for this!

You miserable fools!

Freeza!

Now you have done it. All of you.

You have shattered my dreams of gaining immortality.

I am not reading the Ginyu Special Corps.

Ribbit! Ribbit...! Ribbit...!

Did you people kill them?

I truly must say... you little fools...

Are you ready to pay the price?

I have to say, having the Dragon Balls turn to stone at the last moment...is a shame for Vegeta-san, but even more so for myself.

This is the first time any fool has disrespected me this much.

I had no idea things would turn out like this.

Y-You'll pay for this...!

I swear you'll pay for this, you worms!

I'll kill you, slowly and surely!

Not a single one of you is getting away! Say your prayers!

You've finally shown your true colors, huh?

Go ahead and try it!

If you think I'll be defeated that easily, you're gravely mistaken!

Of all the things you might have said...it seems you've forgotten how terrifying I can be.

Let me remind you.

I-It can't be!

T-To think he'd be this dreadful...!


A Tormenting Super Transformation! Freeza's One Million Fighting Power"   




That huge Ki just got even larger.

Has that Freeza guy finally gone into action?

I sense a faint Ki. I hope that isn't Gohan!

A Namekian, who looks just like me...

He's close to death.

A-Are you the Namekian the earthlings were talking about?

Y-You are... Then their wish was granted. Good.

Ho, you seem to know all about everything, huh?

Then you must also know that I am hurrying to help those kids.

Yeah...

Sorry, but I'll have to leave you here to die.

You surprise me.

I don't know what kind of training you've done, but you've gained an unbelievable level of power.

Which makes it all the more a shame.

If only you had come back here as your original, single self...

What?!

...you could have beaten Freeza.

Hmph, are you saying that if I had merged with Kami, and we had become one again, our power would be greater than even that Freeza bastard?

Th-That's right. I was overwhelmingly beaten by Freeza, but I think I... know Freeza's power pretty well.

Hmph, it doesn't make any difference now.

Besides, I never intend to rejoin with him!

Then...j-join with me.

I am the last...warrior-type Namekian on this world.

What? You?

Y-Yes. Your own power would increase several times over.

I'm flattered by your offer, but I want to be who I am.

I don't want to join your individuality with mine.

Heh... You're a proud one...

Hurry! There's no time!

I am going to die soon. Quickly, place your hand on my body!

D-Don't worry.
Your personality will be your own.

I will be yours. I will be nothing more than a catalyst.

You wouldn't lie to me, right?

If you think I would, then go on ahead and get killed by Freeza.

All right. Very well, I'll try it your way.

But if I don't like it the least little bit, I'll drive you out right away.

That's a fine thing to say, when I'm offering you a wonderful present with the best of intentions.

I'm in a hurry. if you're going to do this, then do it.

Y-You make sure you kill Freeza. Got it?

Hmph, I don't need to hear it from you.

That's what I want, if I can manage it.
For my own sake, as well.

N-No way... How can this be...?

What power!

What unbelievable, amazing power!

I-Is this what it is to merge with someone?!

I can beat him! Whoever my opponent may be, I can't lose!

I have just obtained ultimate power!

Gohan, at this rate, Vegeta will be finished off in no time!

We have to get in there, and go for broke!

Right!

Kuririn-san!

What a Ki... There's no way we can win...

Of course not. Do you think that three mere ants can beat a dinosaur?

Yes, we can.

If we three fight together, we can manage to beat you.

What did you say? You can beat me?

That's right.

Of all the things you might have said...

Freeza, not even you appear to have realized this, but their battle powers are rising quickly.

The little one, in particular, has a hidden power that not even he is aware of.

And I am in the process of becoming the Super Saiyan that you are so afraid of!

I'm surprised that you would tell such a whopper as that.

A Super Saiyan?

You are really pushing my buttons, you bastard!

What?!

I see. So it wasn't complete hogwash.

It's true... If the three of us fight together, we might be able to get through this.

Sure, he's incredibly tough, but our power has increased, too!

I see. After coming here, Vegeta has gained strength beyond his limits.

But then, why is Freeza so unusually calm and composed?

Transform yourself, Freeza.

T-Transform?!

If we're going to do this, why don't you transform right now, and show us your true self?!

Ho, I am impressed that you knew about that.

How did you find out?

That bastard Zarbon let it slip.

W-What are you talking about?!

There are a very small number of weirdos out there in the universe that are able to alter their forms when it becomes necessary.

Whether for the sake of camouflage, or to prevent them from consuming energy unnecessarily in their usual states.

My case is a little different.

It is because I have too much power, and cannot control it myself.

W-What?

Don't let him scare you! He's just bluffing!

He won't change that much.

Are you sure about that?

Very well. if you want to die that badly, I'll show you.

Watch closely, now. This is not something you will see every day.

After all, I had absolutely no need to transform myself when I attacked Planet Vegeta, where the Saiyans lived.

Vegeta-san, your father, the king of Planet Vegeta, was not all that big a deal.

Don't let that fact swell your head!

I had surpassed the king's power when I was just a little kid!

The Saiyans' planet was destroyed by him, was it?

Now, prepare to be stunned!

Ha! What kind of transformation is that?! it's laughable!

Imagine, your transformation consisting of stripping out of that, and making yourself lighter!

Vegeta-san, you disappoint me.

And after all the favor I have shown you, too.

If only you had remained submissive to me, you would not have had to experience this terror.

What?!

You mean you're now just getting to it?!

What?!

Th-This can't be right...!

W-We're gonna die!

I-It's a nightmare!

Watch yourselves.

Now that I'm like this, I won't be as gentle as I was before.

W-What a Ki!

W-What is this?!

The strength of Freeza's Ki just increased many times over!

I-It couldn't be...!

Gohan!

Vegeta, where's all that energy you had a moment ago?

You were pretty free with your words, weren't you?

Well, not that I can blame you.

Not now that I've shown you my overwhelming power.

W-What a monster!

Like I said, watch yourselves.

After all, I have more power than I can handle.

I just might overdo things.

Incidentally, you can be sure my battle power is at least a million.

W-What?!

O-Oh, no...

N-Not even you could be that strong...

Hmph, if you think I'm lying, then allow me to demonstrate.

Dende!

What is this?! What has that bastard Freeza done?!

What is with this planet?!

W-Where's Kuririn-san?!

Where's Kuririn-san?!

Over here!

You're bleeding!

It's no big deal. One of those rock fragments just hit me.

Your swiftness in fleeing is quite impressive. I applaud you.

But then, that one was just my way of offering my regards.

Even a Saiyan is capable of that.

D-Damn it!

The look on your face is pathetic, Vegeta.

Apparently, you never imagined that I would become this strong.

Well now, who shall I show hell to first?

I've decided!

H-He's fast!


Freeza Bares His Fangs! Gohan's Transcendent Power attacks"   




D-Damn it all!

That's what you get for focusing attention on the Namekian brat!

You earthlings are too soft!

Whoops, sorry, sorry.

Sure enough, I have too much power, and was unable to control myself too well.

Kuririn-san!

Ho, to think you still had this much energy left.

G-Go... h-han...

Kicked the bucket, have you?

Kuri--

Kuririn-san!

You think you can save him?

It's no use. He'll be dead soon.

Never mind him, why don't you worry about yourself, instead?

Although, worry all you like...Whether you're a Namekian...or an earthling...or a Saiyan...it doesn't change the fact that you're going to die.

Move... Move...

Move...

Move... Move it!!

What?!

That kid's power is rising like crazy!

How can this be? What tremendous energy!

U-Unbelievable... When that kid freaks out and loses control, he can call up that much power?

D-Don't tell me...h-he's the closest one to becoming a Super Saiyan...?

K-Kuririn-san...

Kuririn-san!

It's all right! He's still alive!

D-Don't die, Kuririn-san!

You don't have time to be worried about him!

Did you think that was all it would take to kill Freeza?

You don't appear to be just an ordinary pipsqueak, huh?

Even I found that to be a bit painful.

But you picked the wrong opponent, didn't you?

Like I said earlier, it doesn't change the fact that you're going to die.

For all your effort, all you've done is make me more angry at you.

D-Damn it...

it looks like our thinking was far too optimistic.

It can't be... The power of his Ki is getting much, much stronger...

I didn't think he could control his battle power!

I will take the pain I received and return it to you, many times over!

Freeza's power just surged.
The way things are going, they'll all be...

You idiot! Get out of there!

Whoa, don't go taking too much damage from just that.

The fun is just starting.

You're just a kid, all right.
Ls that all the power you've got?

You fool! You got overconfident, and let your guard down!

You took that one dead-on.

All right...

Just for good measure, here's another fierce one!

Take this!

No match for you, am I?

You're the one who looks like the fool now, Freeza-san.

Don't be in such a rush, Vegeta.

I'll play with you good and long, once I'm done with the runt.

Our...fates... are sealed...

Now then, how would you like me to deal with you?

--He's gone!
--Over here.

What's the matter? Can't you move?

This is the end.

Die!

Gohan's Ki is growing smaller and smaller...

I'm coming now! Just sit tight, Gohan!

What's the matter?

Vegeta, aren't you going to come save him?

It looks to me like you've gotten weak-kneed, and you can't move.

Well then, you just hold out there for a little while longer.

I'm about to crush the life out of this one.

And then, you can have your turn next.

I don't care if that kid dies, but what the hell am I supposed to do against Freeza's unimaginable power?!

Fa... ther...

Pic... colo... san...

G-Gohan's Ki is dropping fast.

H-He's dying!

Damn it...!

I can't wait until I've completely recovered!

--Now, to finish you!
--Kienzan!!

Wha--?!

H-How can he still be...?

H-He should be seriously wounded at the very least!

H-How?!

Kienzan!!

Kuririn! Kuririn's Ki has returned!

What's going on?!

Wha--?!

If you don't like it, come on over here!

I'll paddle your behind!

W-Why, you...!

Mock me, will you?!

H-He's too much for me to handle.

All I can do is run from him.

Yikes!

All right!

Your death will not be an easy one.

I'll take you apart with my own hands!

Hmph! Fool!

Come on out of there!

Whoa!

I don't know how you're back in action, but how dare you clip the tail of Freeza?!

I'll tear you to pieces, so that you can never come back to life again!

Oh, no...

Damn...

You can never escape from me, no matter what you try.

I will personally rip you limb from limb!

Now, come on out!

--Die!
--Taiyo-ken!!

Thank goodness! You're not dead!

I'll heal you, right away!

Vegeta! Now! Attack him!

S-So that's what the deal is!

What are you doing, Vegeta?!

Terrific! Gohan's been healed, too!

Why did you keep it from me that the Namekian kid had that ability?!

We didn't keep it from you!
We didn't know it, either!

If we'd known, we would have had him heal Goku a long time ago!

You surprised me, Dende! Thanks!

Mm-hmm, good luck!

Huh?

Darn you! You're gonna get it!

W-What the...!?

There's his inherited Saiyan blood for you.

After he recovered, his battle power increased dramatically.

All right, maybe luck has turned to our side just a little bit.

Impossible! That runt is back, too.

He was supposed to be on the verge of death, too!

Now! Blast him!

You don't know when to quit.

Damn!

I'm not giving up! Like heck I'm giving up!

Even if it's hopeless... Even if it's hopeless, we have to do this!

G-Gohan, wait!

Piccolo-san!

Sorry to keep you waiting.

Thank goodness! We've been waiting for you, Piccolo-san!

That's Freeza, is it?

I see. He certainly does seem to be an unbelievable monster.

Look what the cat dragged in.

If it isn't that punk we killed on Earth.

I get it. I was wondering what you wished for with the Dragon Balls.

You went and brought this good-for-nothing scum back to life.

Excuse me for being scum. But remember this: After I've taken care of Freeza, you will be next.

After you've taken care of Freeza, you'll do me?

I didn't think that Namekians were capable of telling jokes.

So there's still a Namekian who survived, is there?

But there's something different about him from the other Namekians.

He doesn't appear to be any slouch.

But even so, he's still no match for me.

Who is that? Who just arrived?

I can't tell. I can't tell whose Ki that is.

Piccolo? No, not him. It couldn't be.

This Ki is far too huge to be Piccolo.

Gohan's Ki is back, too.
I don't understand any of this.

Now then, to clean up this cosmic trash.

I'll take him alone. You guys stay out of this!

I-Is that the one named Piccolo?

He looks just like Nail-san!

Find some shelter somewhere, Dende, or you'll get tangled up in this.

Hurry it up.

H-How does he know my name?

Piccolo-san!

This is crazy. There's no way that even Piccolo can beat that guy.

Everyone has stopped moving.

What in the world is going on?

Who is the one that just showed up, with the gigantic Ki?


The Reborn Piccolo Shows Himself! An Enraged Freeza's Second Transformation"   




"Let me handle him"? He has no idea how terrifying Freeza is.

He'll realize it soon enough.

Piccolo-san isn't the sort of person not to know his opponent's strength.

But Gohan, Piccolo--

Yeah. I'm sure Piccolo-san has a chance of winning.

A chance of winning?

There's no way he can win.

His arrival doesn't change our situation one bit.

But Piccolo-san is...

This Ki belongs to Piccolo.
Piccolo has come back to life.

His Ki is awesome now, not like before.

You seem to be quite sure of yourself.

But that confidence will soon crumble as you beg me for your life.

Stuff it.

Take this!

Incredible! He's fighting Freeza toe-to-toe!

No, he's doing even better...

You're amazing, all right, Piccolo-san!

What the hell happened to him?

Not that much time has passed since he was defeated on Earth!

Looks like we'll get out of this alive, Gohan!

Right!

Beat Freeza! He killed so many of our kind!

What kind of training did Piccolo go through?

Attaway. Hang in there until I get there.

Die!!

Come on out of there, now.
You can do better than just that.

Piccolo-san...

You're pretty good, aren't you?

Being able to get out of that, at that distance, by a hairsbreadth...

Why, you undaunted fool!

Gohan, Piccolo has incredible power, more than I imagined!

This could be promising!

Right. Piccolo-san can take him.

He is your teacher, after all.

Right!

Piccolo-san...

Piccolo-san!

Don't panic.

It will take more than that to kill him.

I'll let you watch now, as I take him apart.

P-Piccolo-san!

The Namekians are now completely wiped out.

--What?!
--Piccolo-san!

Don't go selling me short.

You little worm...

Piccolo's Ki just skyrocketed again.

Incredible...

I have obtained the ultimate power!

Piccolo-san!

Piccolo!

What?!

Why, you...!

He's fast! My speed should outpace his!

K-Kuririn-san...

How can this be? He wasn't fighting in earnest up to now?!

Tch, he was giving us false hope!

Piccolo...

What a beast this Freeza is!

You'll have to forgive me for earlier.

I didn't give you enough credit.

But you can handle yourself better than I imagined, so I decided to show off my power.

That is what I am capable of.

There's no end to his power...
I was going to fight that monster?

Same goes for me. Let's get down to business.

What did you say?

Are you saying you haven't been taking this seriously up to now?

I didn't know that Namekians told tall tales.

You'll find out soon enough.

Th-That's right!

Piccolo has been fighting with that weighted turban and cape all this time?!

I'll show you the wrath of all the Namekians you've killed!

Piccolo's Ki has gotten even stronger.

This is his true strength!

He can beat him! Piccolo-san can beat him!

Piccolo, we're counting on you!

You've removed your heavy gear, and made yourself lighter.

Which would mean that you've improved your speed, huh?

We'll see.

It will take more than this to placate the wrath of the Namekians!

--He got him!
--Gohan!

Kuririn-san!

Now to finish you!

--Is Freeza...?
--Could it be...?

Tch, look there!

As tough as I expected.

You seem to have the wrong idea about my true power.

What?!

Did you think I was fighting for real back there?

You didn't know that I had transformed, did you?

Transformed?

I shall grant you the same feeling of absolute terror that I gave Vegeta and the others.

All right, first, I will fill you with a feeling of utter despair.

Each time I, Freeza, transform, my power greatly increases.

And I have...two more transformations remaining.

Do you understand what that means?

What?!

Impossible!

Gohan, what did he just say?

Freeza said he can transform two more times.

Now then, allow me to show you!

You should be honored!

You are the first ones to ever see this transformation!

Take a good look at the second transformation of Freeza!

Thank you for waiting.

Now then, shall we continue with round ?

Y-You monster!

H-He hasn't changed all that much, has he?

Idiot! Check out his underlying power!

It's nothing like what it was before!

And yet he's regained his composure and collected himself again.

The damage he took from Piccolo-san is gone, too.

Damn it, what is going on out there, really?

That Freeza guy's Ki has gotten stronger again.

I might not be able to beat him now, even fully healed.

What do I do?

You got me.

You seemed to be pretty proud of your speed, huh?

Well now, let us have another look at it.

Damn it! If you've got all the power, I have all the speed!

You can chase me for as long as we live, and not catch me!

I-It can't be!

Well, well, long time no see.
You certainly are here early.

How about we put an end to the fun and games?

D-Damn...

Now you see that your vaunted speed is, unfortunately, of absolutely no use against me, do you not?

It is time for you to give up.

H-He's too fast!

P-Piccolo-san!

He's ridiculously fast! There's no way he can dodge all that!

Piccolo-san...

Piccolo!

Stop it!

Gohan!

Gohan! Damn it...!

--Hold it!
--W-What are you doing, Vegeta?!

You heading off won't do any good!

But unless we do something...

Listen! The way things are going, we'll all be killed by Freeza!

Never mind them, blast me to within an inch of my life!

Do it right now!

I'll have that kid heal me, and after crawling back one more time from the brink of death, I will definitely be able to become a Super Saiyan!


Freeza's Final Transformation! The Ultimate Nightmare Begins!"   



--What?!
--You can just...

...die!!

G-Gohan!

Full power!

Pour it on, Gohan!

Thank you, Piccolo-san.

Go... han...

This is odd.

That little one should not have had that much battle power.

After being close to dying, and recovering, it is as though he is a different person.

So that's it! That little one is a Saiyan!

But whose child is he?
Twenty years ago, all of the Saiyans except for Vegeta, Nappa, and Raditz were exterminated.

Whose is he?

He does not take after Vegeta or Nappa.

So he is Raditz' son?
Something about him seems familiar.

H-He may have knocked that one back, but you've gotten stronger, Gohan. I'm quite pleased.

But we've had it now. 
I hit him with everything I had, but it didn't have any effect on Freeza!

Hey, you!

You know about how, when we Saiyans come back from death's doorstep, our strength increases, right?!

Listen to me. You have to blast me half to death, before Freeza performs his last transformation!

Now, hurry up and do it!

It won't work if I'm the one who injures myself.

You have to do it!

I-I don't have the power to nearly kill you...

Don't worry. I will lower my battle power to its minimum, so your power will be plenty.

We're lucky that Namekian kid, who can instantly treat injuries, is here.

Regardless of how much I hate you, I couldn't.

B-Besides, Goku should just about be recovered.

Kakarrot is the lowest class of warrior!

He won't ever get any stronger!

I must eliminate every last bit of Saiyan blood.

I do not believe in any ridiculous legends about Super Saiyans, the mightiest warriors in all of history, but I still do not feel too great about them.

The little one and Vegeta are growing stronger right before my eyes.

All right... it would be an easy matter for me to blast all of you into little pieces as I am now, but before I kill you, I will show you ultimate power, even more terrifying than death!

Ultimate what...?

It will be my treat.

You will be able to experience a horror even worse than hell-- my true form!

There's still time, if you do it now! Hurry and do it!

No-Oh, man...

Damn it!

See if I care!

That's not going to cut it!

Hit me with a stronger Ki!

Can you do that, you thick-headed good-for-nothing?!

Th-That's better...

I-I'm about to become... a Super Saiyan...

W-Why... did Kuririn-san shoot Vegeta?

G-Gohan! Get away from here!

Right!

Are you all right, Piccolo-san?

I-I can't say that I'm fine...

I know! it'll be all right!
I can get your wounds healed!

There's a Namekian named Dende who can heal injuries.

I'll go ask him to come over here.

--Gohan...
--Kuririn-san, where's Dende?

W-What...?

Y-You say you can't heal me...?

Th-That's right!

Y-You were able to heal the others, but you can't heal me...?

You killed a lot of my friends.
I can't heal someone who did that!

Y-You little brat...

Unless you heal me, we'll never defeat Freeza...!

No!

D-Do it now... I-I'm starting to pass out...

I'm... I'm...

I'm...going to go help him!

Damn you...

...b-brat...

When Saiyans like Vegeta recover from being nearly dead, they gain a whole bunch of strength.

You know that, right?

Y-Yes.

That's why he had me blast him on purpose.

He was sure that he could beat Freeza.

Is that right?

--Dende!
--Dende?

Vegeta!

I-Is it true... that you can... heal injuries...?

Y-Yes!

Dende...

So that's it. That's how they did it.

Unbelievable. Do I have this ability?

No. Like Nail-san, you are a Warrior-type.

Never mind that, Dende, I can understand you not wanting to heal Vegeta, but for the time being, we can't do without him.

He's... the same as Freeza!
He's killed a lot of Namekians!

Heal him for me.

I can handle Vegeta.
However, Freeza is too much for me.

W-What was that? Freeza?

He's finished his transformation!

Damn it! I should've held my Ki, and gone off to hide somewhere!

Go ahead and try it! He'll just blow the entire planet of Namek away!

He doesn't have any more use for this world!

W-What kind of ridiculously huge Ki is that?!

A-An out-of-this-world monster is about to appear!

D-Dende, please, heal Vegeta.

Dende...

He's coming into view!

You filthy little brat!

Be grateful I didn't kill you!

Freeza's battle power...

So you've finally shown your true self, have you?

Bring it on, Freeza, and all other comers.

I have just become a Super Saiyan!

That's Freeza's true form?

He's smaller, and more slender.

He doesn't seem to have as much punch.

H-He's a textbook example of not judging someone's ability by their appearance.

He's been cuddly, up to now.

D-Damn it!

And after all the trouble you went through getting your wish granted with the Dragon Balls...

I'm sorry.

I just... don't think I'm going to be able to help you. Damn.

Piccolo-san...

How can that be? Freeza's Ki has gone up again.

Damn it.

"Bang."

W-What?!

D... Dende!!

I-I didn't see it! All I saw was something flash!

Th-That's impossible!

Now, none of you can be revived, right?

D-Dende...

Somebody died. Who was it?

Damn it, I don't know what's going on out there.

Dende has been killed...

Damn it!

H-He watched us being restored by him.

Th-That's why he was first.

D-Darn him...

Ah! He disappeared!

That fool!

W-Where...?

--Over here!
--What?!

When did he...?

I promised you, didn't I?

That I would show you a horror even worse than hell?

However, the Namekian child there was unable to go through it.

That's a shame.

I'll make sure that you experience enough to make up for it.

Damn you!

The petty cries of maggots grate on my nerves Know your place, you inferior life forms When the consummate emperor's wish is granted, The verse of love will be but a chilling elegy

Y-You're not getting away!

Did you get him?!

H-He disappeared again.

Th-That's impossible!

You dumbasses! Behind you!

What?!

That's correct.


The Moment We've Waited For! Son Goku is Revived"   



Get out of the way, dumb-ass!

I-I-I couldn't see him move, or his attack, this time, either...

H-He was able...

Vegeta was able to see it. B-But why?

Have his abilities really gone up that much?

Th-Thank you...for saving me.

Don't get the wrong idea. I didn't save you.

I just thought I would let you see something cool.

S-Something cool?

D-Don't tell me you think you can beat him!

--Oh, yeah.
--Y-You don't mean...

You guys are in my way.
Back away, and watch very closely.

You certainly are sure of yourself, Vegeta.

Or is it that you're so terrified, you've lost your mind?

Go ahead and smirk now, while you still can.

What stands before you...is the thing... you fear most--a Super Saiyan!

--S...
--Super... Saiyan...?

W-What's that? What is a Super Saiyan?

I see you still take jokes too far.

Hmph, in that case, let me show you what a super-elite like me is capable of, now that I have become a true Super Saiyan!

Is that Vegeta's Ki?

He's gone and powered up like crazy.

Whoever you may be, you don't stand a chance against me. 
I am the prince of Saiyans

I am number one

Gohan, let's put our money on Vegeta, and go find some shelter, now!

Higher! I grow stronger.
Th-Though I have to admit, I didn't think his power would shoot up so dramatically.

A warrior race-- such is my blood

You can see it for yourself.

That's why Vegeta had me blast him half to death, and then had Dende revive him.

Get you down! (Get you down!)
Get you down! (Get you down!)

S-So that's what that was about. Sure enough...

I was born to fight

Saiyan blood!!

Beat you down! (Beat you down!)
Beat you down! (Beat you down!)

I am about to become legend

W-What? What happened?

Huh? Neither one of them is any different from before. What the...?

No, you're wrong, Gohan. Sense out Vegeta's Ki.

It may be still, but it's become incredibly huge.

Amazing. To think that his Ki is as massive as this...

Hmm, one would think that you've powered up substantially.

Hmph, stuff it! Be grateful you've lost your Scouter!

If you saw what our battle powers are on your Scouter now, you'd probably run away from here in tears.

That's because my power is now even greater than yours.

Brace yourself, Freeza.
This time, you're through!

What's the matter? Are you too scared to say anything?

Huh, Freeza-san?

Okay, okay. I get it, I get it.

If that's how badly you want it, then I will have a look at the power of "history's mightiest warrior," the Super Saiyan.

Don't you mock me!

I see you!

Kakarrot isn't going to get a shot at you!

A-Awesome!

F-Freeza is being completely swept away by him!

N-No...

V-Vegeta... i-is gonna get killed...

Piccolo-san...

What's the matter, Freeza?!
You won't beat me by just running away!

What?! Th-This can't be! W-Where is he?!

Th-There's no way that I, a Super Saiyan, could have lost sight of him!

What?!

I-Impossible...

I go no-nonsense on speed for a second, and you can't keep up, huh?

And you call yourself a Super Saiyan?

I-It can't be...

Vegeta has all of that power and speed, and yet he's being toyed with.

He's an out-of-this-world monster, all right!

Vegeta, to be honest, with that level of attack and speed, you won't be able to beat me.

I seem to remember you saying you were a Super Saiyan, right?

If that's what you are, is this really the best "history's mightiest" can do?

Don't make me laugh.

The Super Saiyan really is no more than a silly legend, after all.

I-Is this really the best I can do?

Have I not become a Super Saiyan?

Or is Freeza a foe that not even a Super Saiyan can beat?

Ridiculous! That can't be possible!

There's no way that can be possible!

There's absolutely no way that can be possible!

Hmph. Fool...

I see you!

I see you, Freeza!

That miserable Vegeta...!

What?!

I-I am...

I am... a Super Saiyan!

You burn in hell, Freeza!

Are you trying to blow the whole planet away, Vegeta?!

W-What?!

Perhaps it's about time.

I can't have you getting too full of yourself, after all.

H-He knocked that back at him, with just a kick...?

Vegeta had to have launched that attack at full power.

He's incredible... He's beyond incredible...

This time, I will be coming at you.

Nice and easy.

Vegeta...

For the first time ever, Vegeta is genuinely trembling...out of pure fear and utter frustration.

He's even shedding tears, out of terror and despair.

This is a first for him.

Here I come. Are you ready?

Vegeta has... Vegeta has already lost the will to fight.

Don't!

He's done for.

Vegeta, I can't have you give up after just that.

You have to endure even more.

Horror beyond hell, that is.

Well? Do you regret your foolishness at all yet?

You lowlife, good-for-nothing-but-fighting Saiyan?

I thought you, at least, were different, so I took you under my wing.

But sure enough, you were no different from the other fools, were you?!

If only you hadn't turned on me, you wouldn't have to go through this.

If you'd like to help him out, feel free at any time.


Defeat Freeza, Son Goku! The Proud Vegeta's Tears"   




Piccolo-san...

Okay, they're right nearby.

Forgive me, I'm coming now!
I think I can pull this off!

This is no fun. it looks like all the fight has gone out of you.

This may be a bit soon, but maybe I should finish you off.

Aha...

Sure enough, that huge Ki belongs to you, Piccolo.

S-Son...

Way to go. The Dragon Balls brought you here, did they?

Father...

Are you okay now?

Yeah. Thanks to you guys, I've recovered from all that damage.

You fought well, Gohan.
Let me handle it from here.

What?!

L-Let you handle it?

Are you planning to take on that monster by yourself?!

Yeah.

Father...

I-Is that really you, Goku?

Your Ki feels different than it has up until now.

S-Son!

Th-That's Son? His Ki is unbelievably strong.

There's no comparison to when he was back on Earth!

You're Freeza, are you?

You're a lot punier than I thought you'd be.

There's still some of you trash left, is there?

Vegeta promised me a fight.
Don't come between us.

I've seen this guy somewhere before...

K-Kakarrot... you're...

Kakarrot? That's a Saiyan name.

Him!

Freeza, get out here! I'm gonna make you pay!

--It's Freeza-sama!
--Freeza-sama!

Everything changes now.

Him! It was definitely him!

The fate of Planet Vegeta...my own fate...Kakarrot's fate...as well as...your fate!

This is the end!

He looks just like the Saiyan who resisted me right to the end, when I destroyed Planet Vegeta.

W-What?!

K-Ka... kar... rot...

Kakarrot!!

I won't leave a single Saiyan alive.

You fool. You could just take it easy and tremble before me.

Yeah, maybe.

H-He's not the same Kakarrot as before...

He's finally overcome his limitations...

Which means...!

Are you ready?

Yep.

W-What?! Did Goku just do something?!

No way!

Not even I could see that clearly.

His speed was even greater than Freeza's!

Get out of the way, Goku!

Yikes! Get out of the way, Goku!

You're an insolent one.

It can't be. You deflected them all?

And with only one hand?

Freeza, you'd better fight him like you mean it...

H-He is the very thing you fear most...

A Super Saiyan...!

That's right... The legendary, mightiest warrior in the universe...

A Super Saiyan...

Freeza, you're finished now... You asked for it...!

V-Vegeta!

You know, Vegeta, that I don't like unfunny jokes.

Vegeta!

Hey! Vegeta couldn't even move anymore!

There was no need for you to finish him off!

That's what he gets for endlessly carrying on about that nonsensical legend of the Super Saiyan.

I hate people who won't shut up.

K-Kakarrot...

Vegeta!

A-Are you still preaching that "mercy" crap...?

Do you mean you're not a Super Saiyan...?

Wait!

You dumb-ass! Harden your heart!

If you had put aside your mercy...you'd have surely become a Super Saiyan...

There ain't no way that I could act as cold-blooded as you do.

And for that matter, I don't know anything about any "Super Saiyan."

A S-Super Saiyan is...

Don't speak anymore!
You're just gonna hasten your death!

Fire!

Magnificent! Just look at them, Zarbon-san, Dodoria-san!

Look at how beautiful the fireworks are!

L-Listen to me closely, Kakarrot...

I've run through his heart and everything. He's a stubborn one.

Are you going to keep talking?

Th-The reason why Planet Vegeta, the world where you and I were both born, is gone...i-is not because it collided with a giant meteor...Freeza destroyed it...We Saiyans served as his hands and feet, and did as we were ordered to...but he killed everyone but us...including your parents, and my father, the king...it was because, as the Saiyans started to grow in strength, Freeza was afraid that a Super Saiyan would be born...

Hmph, give me a break.

Vegeta...

I-I beg you... defeat... defeat Freeza...P-Please... by Saiyan hands... d-defeat...

Vegeta...

He finally kicked the bucket, huh?

Well then, shall we reconvene this horror show?

For you to cry...For you to beg of me...must have been pretty demeaning for you.

What's the situation on Planet Namek?

Vegeta is dead.

W-What?!

V-Vegeta? You mean he...?

Yes. He was killed by Freeza, like it was nothing.

After serving as Freeza's right-hand man, and serving as he was ordered to, he ultimately turned on him, and was killed.

Such a pitiful story.

Was it his pride as a Saiyan?

I-Is that how fearsome this Freeza is?

They have touched that which is untouchable, that's what they touched.

D-Damn. Not even Goku could stand up to an opponent like that.

So then, what about Goku?

He is planning to fight him.
He apparently intends to defeat Freeza.

Goku!

--Goku...
--Goku...

I get it.

You ain't upset that your Saiyan pals were killed.

You were beside yourself over having to be his puppet, weren't you?

I may have hated you...but you had the pride of a Saiyan.

I'm going to share part of that pride.

I am a Saiyan, raised on Earth.

And for all of the Saiyans that you've killed...as well as... for all of the Namekians here...I'm gonna take you down!

What nonsense.


Son Goku vs. Freeza! The Curtain Opens on the Super Decisive Battle!"   




W-What kind of power does he have inside him?

Son, when did you get that much power?

Guys, we're getting out of here! We're in the way!

Gohan! Hurry!

Gohan!

Father!

Father, don't die! Let Freeza have it!

So that's it. He ain't able to read Ki.

Father!

Gohan!

A-Awesome... it's beyond awesome...

I'm alive again!

B-But I've still had it. I can't walk anymore.

I'm going to die here.

Without going back to Earth, not being watched over by anyone, alone and forsaken.

It's true, the fairest flowers soonest fade.

I've had enough! I'm not about to die here, surrounded by frogs!

Whoo! Hot! Hot! Hot!

Ooh, that stings!

Now, then...

He's not that bad.

W-What's happened?

Don't tell me Son is...!

Nah, he's putting up a good fight.

Those Saiyans are an unusual bunch.

Or maybe it's just Goku.
His strength knows no bounds.

It's as though he's a different person than when he trained here.

He's a hard one to figure out, isn't he?

What a piece of work.

You're an insolent one!

W-What...?

Hot! Hot! Hot!

An eruption? Why is that happening now?

Father!

Son...

End of the line!

Hey, don't go around wrecking other people's planets so much!

What if it gets broken?!

You appear to be a lot stronger than I thought. I'm a bit surprised.

Imagine, someone in this world who is better than Commander Ginyu.

But you're no match for me.

Maybe not. But you can never tell.

Oh, yes I can.

Right back at you!

He escaped from my psyche blast!

Ee-yow! Ooh, that hurt!

Hurry up on out of there.

There's no way you'd give in after just that.

That bastard has incredible speed.

Okay now, what am I gonna do?

He doesn't seem able to sense an opponent's location using their Ki, the way we can.

He consistently seeks me out with his eyes.

All right, guess I'll make use of that.

What's the matter?

Goku still hasn't come up!

It's all right! Father's Ki hasn't dropped one bit!

It's kinda been a while since I've done this.

I wonder how old man Turtle Hermit is doing.

Ka... me... ha... me...Ha!!

All right, hold it there, hold it there...

What's the matter? Not ready yet?

And here I was going to give you your final gift.

All right, here goes!

Off you go!

Here he comes!

That's not him!

One more!

Over here!

No!

A resounding success.

Huh?

That didn't hurt you at all?

I didn't expect you to be this good.

You're the first person, not including my father, to get me covered in dust.

This might be the first time in my life that I've been this excited.

How shall I deal with you?

Aw, man... l thought that would have hurt you at least a little.

I think I'll terrorize you for a bit.

Damn it, is this telekinesis?!

shoot!

All right, if that's how you want it...!

You've got a lot of nerve.

What is that?!

I-It's a whole island!
The whole island is floating!

Son!

This time, you're finished.

--I caught you!
--Oh, crap!

I can't... move...

it serves you right.

When I miss, you're through.

Gotta get out of this somehow...

The game is just about over.
I've grown tired of it.

W-What?

This one just might kill you.

Gohan!

Piccolo-san!

Goku...

Father...

What a monster. Freeza is just playing with him.

He's got enough power to blow up this world, if he wanted to.

And yet, judging by the fact that we're still alive...

He really is just playing around, huh?

What a beast!

Piccolo-san, what about Father?

Don't waste your time worrying about him.

That son of a gun isn't serious yet, either.

Look over there.

Father!

Whew... that was kind of a close one.

I'll have to watch out for that attack.

I told you before, don't go wrecking other people's planets so much!

How did Goku manage to...?

He escaped from his paralysis at super speed

at the instant of the explosion.

He did something that amazing?
In that one instant?

The both of them are monsters, damn it!

You're a persistent one. Even I'm starting to get a little ticked off.

So am I.

I think I've had enough warming up, so I'm going to start fighting like I mean it.

So am I.


A Physical war That Exceeds All Limits! Goku and Freeza and Ginyu, Again?!" 
  



Which are you better at--fighting in the air, or on the ground?

Which one? On the ground, I guess.

You mean you're going to fight me on the ground, where I'm better at it?

You're pretty accommodating.

Or are you just that confident?

Despite how it may appear, I am quite nice.

I know. I'll let you have one other freebie I've been saving.

Another freebie?

I won't use my hands against you.

How's that?

Your hands, huh? That's pretty generous.

Now then, is it okay if I lead off?

Of course.

Whatever you like.

My, my, what's the matter?
Are you already done with your attack?

Your moves are too slow.

This one will be to the left, now.

Now the right!

Right! Left! Right!

And a final one to the right!

You're strong. For as big as you talk, you also have amazing speed.

It's funny. Here I am, fighting someone this incredibly strong, but for some reason, I'm getting really excited.

If you're not gonna make a move, then I'll bring it to you again!

What?!

Damn it, I can't get loose!

I thought you weren't going to use your hands.

Your freebie time has expired.

Then maybe this is a freebie from me, but I should warn you...

Warn me?

You place too much confidence in your strength.

As a result, you leave yourself wide open.



You are strong. indeed, you might even say phenomenal.

Why, thanks.

But I'm growing tired of this fight.

I think it's about time to settle this.

First, though, let me ask you one final thing:

What do you say? Would you like to work under me?

I'd hate to eliminate all that power you've got.

After all, you'd be able to serve me even better than Commander Ginyu.

You've gotta be kidding me.

Did you really think I would accept your offer?

I figured you would say that.

Saiyans are stubborn to the point of foolishness, after all.

Well then, there is but one avenue left for you.

Only death.

I don't know. it ain't gonna be that easy.

Such self-assuredness. However, I can tell, despite you telling me you're fighting all-out, you're still keeping quite a bit of your power back.

Hmm? You caught me.

With that in mind, the way I figure it...if I go to about 50 percent, or in
other words, half of my max power, I will be able to reduce you to cosmic dust.

That's a bit of an exaggeration.
You're bluffing too hard.

It's been fun.

It really has been a long time since I've had this much of a workout.

What's going on? The two of them are just staring at each other.

They're both looking for the right time to attack.

I have to admit, the force of their incredible Ki is almost smothering.

Father can beat him, right?

There's no way to know that.

Their power is far beyond our comprehension now.

That's the truth.



I hate to do this. I really do.

If you were to come work for me, every day, wonderful things would await you.

Both King Vegeta, and Vegeta...as well as that lower-class warrior Burdock...

They were all so terribly obstinate.

And it cost them their lives.



If I go to about 50 percent, or in other words, half of my max power, I will be able to reduce you to cosmic dust.

H-He ain't bluffing...

What speed! I couldn't see a thing.

Again, I didn't see Freeza's movements.

Is that how wide a gap there is between our powers?

Like I said, if I go to about half of my max power, I can reduce you to cosmic dust.

D-Damn...

Your speed is too slow! I see right through you!

Glad you could make it!

Damn it...

What's the matter?
Never mind half of my max power, I'm not even using a third of it.

That's what you get!

Looks like you're finally starting to get winded.

But then, the fact that you're not dead yet is amazing all by itself.

It's impossible. He's too strong.

W-Who knew he was this powerful?

Kaio-sama, Goku is wearing those heavy clothes, right?

No.

What he's wearing now is just sturdy. it's not weighted.

I-Is that right?

No-Oh, no. Then, Goku is...

Goku...

There's nothing to worry about, Chaozu.

Goku is going to win this fight.

Have you forgotten about the Kaio-ken technique?

The way Goku is now, he should be able to withstand ten times his own maximum power.

That's right!

Yeah!

Hooray! Hooray!

No...

Unfortunately, he's using that times-ten Kaio-ken already.

Oh, no!

Th-This is bad. There's too much difference in their powers.

Father...

--Bulma-san...?
--That's Freeza-sama for you, against a Saiyan.

What splendor!

W-Who are you?!

I am...

Watch out, Piccolo!


It's a 20-Fold Kaioken! A Kamehameha with Everything on the Line"   



This is too easy. Feel free to
be a little more entertaining.

W-What a technique...!

Like I told you, if I wanted to, I could destroy this entire planet.

I'm the one who brought about the destruction of Planet Vegeta.

H-He's got me...

I-I can't beat him.

What did he do?

H-He cut right through the planet itself.

A-And I have to wonder, does Goku have any ideas?

It looks like this is starting to become a one-sided beatdown.

He doesn't have any ideas.

Freeza's abilities are just far greater than Goku or any of us ever thought.

W-What?

Th-Then Goku is...

Son is already using his times-ten Kaio-ken, the most that he can manage, and he's still being beaten, Kaio-sama?

What's worse, Freeza says that he isn't even using half of his full strength.

No-Oh, no!

Th-This is why I told him that no matter what happened, he was not to take any action against Freeza.

He's lost...

You need not worry.

I won't kill you instantly, with a move such as that one.

Doing so wouldn't be enough to placate my anger.

I-I guess I'll just have to raise my Kaio-ken up to times-twenty somehow.

My body may not be able to handle it...b-but if, as he says, he's only using 50 percent of his power, there really ain't nothing else I can do.

It's too late for you to agonize about this.

You're the one who started it, after all.

You're going to be my plaything until I grow tired of you.

What's the matter?
You've got to fight back a little.

It's no fun without a challenge.

Hey, now, the fun is just getting started.

It's not yet time to go to bed.

I can't take it anymore!

Well? How does it feel to be a fish?

Kuririn...!

Chichi!

Goku-sa...!

Goku-sa!

Father!

Gohan!

Father!

W-What?!

Father!

G-Goku!

For Gohan, Chichi, and everyone on Earth and Planet Namek's futures, there ain't no way I'm gonna lose!

Whether what he's saying about only using 50 percent of his power is just a bluff, or whether it ain't, the only thing I can do is risk a times-twenty Kaio-ken!

Ka...me...ha...me...Ha!!

D-Damn it all...

How can that be? it didn't even hurt him that much.

H-He wasn't bluffing this time, either.

He really was only using half of his power.

U-Unbelievable.

G-Goku's Kamehame-Ha just now had tremendous power!

So why?

Why did Freeza take hardly any damage?

Father's Ki has dropped significantly!

How can there be someone like that guy in our world?

He's utterly beaten. 
Kaio was right.

No matter what happened, we should not have acted against Freeza.

Th-That was a close one.

H-How does that lowlife Saiyan have that kind of incredible power?

He's the first one to push my body this far.

Miserable Saiyan!

That one...hurt.

It hurt!

F-Father!

You monkey!

What happened to all that energy you had a moment ago?

You little worm. Have you gone and used up all of your power?

If that's all you've got, then maybe I should end this.

I really have lost a lot of power.

Sure enough, that times-twenty Kaio-ken was too much for me.

As I thought, you Saiyans are inferior life forms, whose only use is in battle.

Every last one of you is a fool.

I was right to have killed you off.

I've... had it...

Kakarrot, I thought you were better than this.

Is that all the power you have?
Where is your Saiyan pride?!

I-I ain't a Saiyan!

Are you still saying that?
You are a model Saiyan!

Vegeta, none of that matters now.

You and I ain't...

Vegeta, are you...?

You are a Saiyan.

Within you flows the blood of the warrior Saiyan race.

Don't you feel upset?
The world where you and I were born, Planet Vegeta, was destroyed by Freeza over there!
Does it not wound your pride as a Saiyan that he's done nothing but mow us down? Including your father, Burdock, as well as... ...my old man, King Vegeta... Kakarrot, you are the last Saiyan left.
He intends to kill every last Saiyan.
It's because he fears the birth of the mightiest warrior in all the universe, the legendary Super Saiyan! 
I wanted to be the one to defeat him, if I could...but he killed me like I was a rag doll.
You can't know how frustrating that is.
But I beg you, Kakarrot...
You make sure to defeat Freeza, by your own hand!

I don't understand what you're thinking.

That's something that I hate!

No, I will not let you die easily.

I still want to enjoy this some more.

Vegeta...

I grew up on Earth, so I don't know nothing about Saiyans.

But I do understand your frustration.

More of that nonsense?

I can't lose. I can't lose, not to Freeza!

Don't you mess with me!


This Is the Last Trump Card! Goku's Extra-Large Genki Dama"   




What?!

Why, you!

That was a bit of a close shave.

It looks like you've gotten some of your fight back, huh?

But then, Saiyans are, after all, inferior life forms.

I am able to read what your next attack will be.

You will never be able to beat me.

It looks like you're just about through.

You'll be wanting to die soon, right?

I will put you out of your misery now.

I can't take this anymore! I'm... I'm going in!

W-Wait!

Why? Father is going to be killed!

Goku is about to do something.

But what? What can he do with the little power he has left?

What? What are you planning to do?

Ah! A Genki Dama!

What? Genki Dama?

Y-Yeah.

The Genki Dama is an ace-in-the-hole move that Kaio-sama taught him.

He has the grasses, the animals, ourselves, and even the microbes on this planet each share a little bit of their life's genki energy with him.

He then forms an energy ball with it, and attacks.

What?

Damn, Kaio didn't mention that to us, huh?

But will it work against Freeza?

Th-There are a lot fewer living things on this world than on Earth.

What choice does he have?
Goku knows that much!

But is there anything else he can do?
He's got no other choice!

Th-This Genki Dama was the last thing I wanted to use.
It will probably have too much force, and there's no guarantee it won't smash up the planet itself.

But I have to defeat Freeza now, while I still can, or the universe itself will get wrecked.

I don't know whether or not this will work, but I have to do it.

What is that?

You've thought up some more of your nonsense, huh?

As worn-out as you are, what do you think you can do?

G-Goku...

Is he really gonna be able to defeat Freeza with a Genki Dama?

What is this? What is he doing?

Why is he just standing there, and not making any moves?

Grasses, trees, and animals of Planet Namek, as well as all living creatures throughout the universe, please share some of your genki energy with me, just a little bit from each of you.

I ain't gonna defeat Freeza with just the energy from this planet.

Those of you on the many worlds near Planet Namek, share just a little bit of your genki energy with me.

W-What is this? What am I picking up?

Th-That's...

Th-The Genki Dama!

I-It can't be...!

Th-That huge thing is...

I-It's huge! Look at how huge it is!

Is it really all that big?

The one on Earth was about this size.

This one has to be meters in diameter.

There's no way he could get a Genki Dama that big, no matter what he did, from the energy of this planet alone.

Goku is collecting Ki from nearby planets, as well.

It doesn't look like Freeza has realized it yet.

Why doesn't he attack him right away?

He has to collect more Ki, and make it even bigger, or it won't defeat Freeza. I'm sure that's what Goku is thinking.

Father! Hurry, hurry!

Planets of the universe, give me your genki energy!

What's the matter? This is some kind of tactic, right?

Take your shot.

Or are you just raising your hands to surrender?

The time it takes to collect enough Ki is this thing's greatest weakness.

Please, don't let him find out for a little longer.

Enough, already. How long do you intend to stay like that?

Good question. How long, indeed?

W-Why, you...!

--He knows!
--No, not yet.

Well, then? Weren't you going to launch some sort of attack?

Are you trying to make a fool of me?

A little more...

Well? What are you trying to do?

--G-Goku!
--Father!

Gohan! Kuririn! Give me whatever Ki you've got left!

Give it to me, right now!

Right!

Come on, don't be in such a hurry.

Don't you mock me, you simian bastard!

Don't think about anything else! Focus your Ki!

Right!

I don't understand what you Saiyans are thinking.

I never have, either.

You're an unpleasant bunch.

I have no intention of carrying on this dull fight any longer.

I'm going to finish you, along with the whole planet.

The other little runt will die, as well.

Then, every last Saiyan will be gone from this world.

The legendary Super Saiyan was nothing more than a fantasy after all, huh?

That's not the sun. What is it?

Th-The jig is up...

W-What is that?!

Don't tell me that's a mass of energy!

Th-That's what you were...

All right, that's good. Keep a little bit of Ki for yourselves.

Looks like he's finally discovered it.

Gohan, Kuririn, you guys stay here!

No matter what happens, don't jump in!

H-He was making that thing in mid-air?

Where did he find that much remaining power?

It's all over now. Even if I use the Genki Dama now, he'll dodge it.

On top of that, it ain't big enough to defeat Freeza anyway!

Damn it!

Hmph, you were planning to blindside me with that?

You're so pathetic.

Your last-ditch strategy ended up being futile, huh?

Damn it!

Too bad.

Damn it!

Away with you.

Piccolo!

Goku, hurry up and finish your Genki Dama thing!

Thanks!

Make it quick, Goku!
With my power as it is now, that sneak attack was the most that I could manage!

You got it!

Is that rotten Namekian still lingering around?!

I'm surrounded by pesky flies, sneaking around all over the place!

Aren't you done yet, Son Goku?!
Isn't your Genki Dama finished?!

That Freeza punk has completely lost his cool now!

N-Not yet... This is still going to take some time...

Throw it! Throw it, already!

I-I can't... Just a little longer...

You don't know when to die, and you're still hanging around here.

Let me show you the power of someone who doesn't know when to die!

Piccolo-san...

Piccolo might be thinking of giving his life.

He probably used up most of his energy on that sneak attack earlier.

Now he's going to risk his own life to buy enough time for Goku to finish the Genki Dama.

Piccolo-san!

Wait, Gohan!

Goku, please hurry.

Hmph, that won't work.

Don't you get it? That won't work!

It appears that you want to die first.

Goku! Hurry... Hurry up and finish the Genki Dama!

Piccolo...

G-Gohan...

Aren't you done yet, Goku?!

I'm almost at the end of my rope!

Just a little longer.

Just a little longer until I can defeat Freeza.

As you wish, I will kill you first.


Awaken Warrior of Legend... Super Saiyan, Son Goku!"   




Those guys... They stretched what little Ki they had left to attack.

Imagine, those bugs still remaining in their spot...

They are indeed skilled at trying my patience.

This ends now!

I'll scrap you, along with this whole planet!

Goku, aren't you done yet?!

All right! it's finished!

Goku! Do it!

Father!

No-Oh, no!

Get down!

Th-This is nothing...!

Th-This is nothing...

Oh? What's this?

H-He got him! Freeza has... Freeza has been beaten by Goku!

He actually defeated Freeza!

--He did it! He did it! He finally defeated him!
--He did it!

--Mm-hmm, Goku has won!
--He did it, he did it!

Kuririn-san!

Hey, you're all right, huh?

Y-Yes.

It's completely different now, huh?

Where's Father? Where's Piccolo-san?

They were right next to it.

You don't think they were engulfed in it, too, do you?

No way.

I can't sense their Ki.

That's just because we don't have enough strength to concentrate.

Piccolo was there with him.
There's no way they would die, right?

K-Kuririn-san, over there...

Piccolo-san!

--It's Goku!
--Father! He's alive!

Yay! They made it! They made it!

Just like I said, right?

Damn, we barely have any Ki left, so we can't fly very fast.

Father!

Piccolo-san!

Piccolo!

Father!

Gohan...

Hey, Goku, are you okay?

Piccolo-san...

Yeah.

Gohan, you must have been worried.

That was incredible!
That Genki Dama sure was huge, huh?

Well, sure. it had the hopes of the universe packed in it.

I thought the two of you were dead.

Hmph, you think we'd be snuffed out that easily?

Now we can return to Earth with our heads held high.

I didn't think I'd ever get my chance...

--At what?
--Eh? Oh...

Th-There's something I've always wanted to do--get married.

Ready to go home?

The spaceship I came in will get us back to Earth in five days.

Wow, I'll be able to see Mother!

Yay! I'll be able to see everyone!

Hooray, hooray!

Yowch...

I completely forgot about Bulma-san!

Ribbit... ribbit... ribbit... ribbit-ribbit...

Don't scare me like that.

I thought that Freeza had popped up again, you know.

I-In one sense, Bulma-san is even more terrifying than Freeza.

Ow! Don't make me laugh too much! I'm aching all over.

I have to say, Namek has been through an awful spot.

But now, the Grand Elder, and everyone else who died, will be able to rest in peace.

How do you know about the Grand Elder?

What, Kuririn?

I-I-It can't be...

Freeza!

He took that massive Genki Dama dead-on, and yet he's still alive...

N-No way...

Goku!

Piccolo!

P-Piccolo-san...

P-P-Piccolo-san!!

W-What? it can't be...

Kaio-sama, something wrong?

Piccolo... Piccolo has been done in.

But Freeza is supposed to be dead now!

Freeza is a terrifying beast.

Worse than I imagined.

P-Piccolo...! Hey, Piccolo...!

Freeza...

Even I thought that one could have killed me.

I, Freeza, very nearly died!

Get out of here, Kuririn and Gohan.

There's a spaceship right near where I first arrived.

Take Bulma and get away from this planet, right now.

Gohan, snap out of it!

I'm going to fight! I'm going to avenge Piccolo-san!

Get going, now! You're in my way!
Do you want us all to die?!

--G-Goku...
--Father...

Do you think I'm just going to excuse you?

I'm not going to let a single one of you leave here alive.

Kuririn-san!

Kuririn!

Kuririn-san!

Don't do it, Freeza!

Goku!!

N-Now what?

It's Kuririn.

Perhaps I'll do the kid next.

Y-You'll pay for that...

How dare you...? How dare you...?!

What?!

Gohan, take Piccolo and go back to Earth, right now.

He's still clinging to life.

Beat it, now, while I still have some shred of reason!

Right!


The Angry Super Saiyan! Throw Your Hat in the Ring Son Goku!"   




W-What kind of change is that?

Saiyans are only supposed to turn into Great Apes.

W-What's going on here?

Hurry it up, Gohan.
If Piccolo dies, Kami-sama dies, too.

You know what it will mean if that happens.

Father...

Don't concern yourself with me!
I will return to Earth afterward!

But how? if we leave in your spaceship...

End of discussion! Are you trying to upset me?!

Father...

Thank you... Thank you, Father.

I'll be waiting.

I'll be waiting for you to come back safe and sound, Father.

There's no way I'm going to let you get away, you fool.

That's enough, you scumbag.

You've killed one innocent person after another...

You even killed Kuririn...

H-How can you have that much power?

I-It can't be...!

You couldn't be...!

Father, I understand.
What Vegeta said was true, huh?

Father, you've become a Super Saiyan.

I am...

I am angry, Freeza!!

You talk like you're so high-and-mighty.

I've killed innocent people?

Are you saying that what you Saiyans have done was so right?

That's why we perished.

And I'm the one who exterminated you.

I couldn't stand you monkeys, you see.

And now, I'm going to exterminate you.

Who, me, Freeza?

I think you've pushed your luck far enough.

There's no way you can win.

Not even if you really are a Super Saiyan.

F-Father...

I ain't gonna accept no apologies from you now.

Y-You dodged it! You couldn't have!

W-Why, you...if only I could connect, you'd be...!

Go ahead and hit me.

W-What?!

Mess with me, will you?!

You can destroy planets, but it seems you ain't able to destroy a single person, huh?

W-W-Who are you?!

You've known all along, haven't you?

I am a Saiyan, who came here from Earth to defeat you.

A legendary warrior, possessed of a serene heart, awakened through intense anger.

I am the Super Saiyan, Son Goku!

T-True enough. You really do appear to be a Super Saiyan.

Possessed of a serene heart, awakened through intense anger, huh?

Indeed. That's why Vegeta couldn't become one, no matter how hard he tried.

Kuririn-san... Dende...
Father is sure to win against Freeza.

He's sure to win, Kuririn and Dende, and avenge your deaths.

There it is! The spaceship Father came here in!

Damn it all!

W-What humiliation I've suffered!

That I, Freeza, should be dealt with by that...by that simian Saiyan bastard like this...!

Unbelievable! I never thought a nightmare like this could ever happen!

You're through, Freeza.

I-I am...

I am Freeza! You're telling me I'm through?!

If I'm to be killed by the likes of you, then I choose to die by my own hand.

Suit yourself.

You fool. Do you think I'm going to die?

You're the one who's dying.

I can go on living in the vacuum of space.

But I'm not so sure about you Saiyans.

You and this planet can both shove it!

Die!!

--Oh, crap!
--Blow up!


Exact Vengeance Son Goku! The Countdown to the Planet's Collapse"   




Piccolo-san, wait here for just a bit.

I have to bring Bulma-san here.

W-What is this? What's happening?!

Father!

K-Kaio-sama...

D-Don't tell me...

Son Goku has done well.

With Freeza as his opponent, his overwhelming strength utterly ensured his victory.

Then, Goku is...

He defeated Freeza, right?

No. When Freeza found himself backed into a corner...he obliterated the planet Namek itself.

So then, Goku and the others...

With the planet lost, nobody can survive.

Nobody but Freeza, that is.

I-It can't be...

it's over. All of it.

Kaio-sama, um...

Kaio-sama, are you able to hear me?

It is I, the Kami of Earth.

What's that? Yes, I can hear you.

I have Mister Popo out gathering the Dragon Balls on Earth right now.

I believe he will have all seven together shortly.

I see.

If I could ask you to wait a moment longer, we should be able to bring back to life those who are in your care, Kaio-sama.

However, Chaozu there has already died twice, and so...

Yes, that is... huh?

H-Hold on a minute. Are you still alive?

Y-Yes. Thankfully so, via the Dragon Balls on Planet Namek.

Which would mean that Piccolo is not dead, either, right?

Yes. As I believe you are aware, Piccolo and I were once a single...

Yeah! Could it be...?

Kaio-sama?

Um, Kaio-sama? Kaio-sama?
Can you hear me? Kaio-sama?

Hey, pipe down!

Goodness gracious!

I-I am not about to die in a place like this!

Father...

Planet Namek is not gone!

Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, and that woman Bulma are all still alive!

--Hooray!
--Hooray!

--Hooray!
--Hooray!
--Hooray!

I guess I held back my power too much.

You were afraid of getting caught in the planet's explosion.

You blew it.

As a result, I've escaped death.

Escaped death?

You don't understand a thing, do you?

We've avoided the instantaneous explosion of the planet.

However, the core has been completely destroyed.

Do you know what that means?

Five minutes.

In five minutes' time, Planet Namek will undergo a huge explosion, and be turned to cosmic dust.

Five minutes will be plenty of time to defeat you, and escape in a spaceship, together with my friends.

Unfortunately for you, I'm the only one who has any hope.

Or at least, more hope than you have.

At this point, I'm going to show you my 100-percent full power!

There will be no way you can defeat me! Brace yourself!

Why would you wait until now to use your full power?

I know why.

If you use your full power, your body won't be able to withstand it.

I can't allow you to stall for time!

I'm going to settle this!

What's the matter?! Are you too afraid of exhausting yourself to use your full power?!

Don't get so...

...cocky!

You underestimated me, huh?

I should warn you, this still isn't my full power.

That was only about 70 percent.

And, starting right now...

...is your much-awaited 100 percent!

I'll take care of this at my full power.

In one minute-- no, in 30 seconds!

No matter what happens, I am going to survive, just you watch--

Somebody, come save me, quick!

Please!

It's no use. I can't locate Bulma-san's Ki anywhere.

I have to say, though, something has started to happen to this world.

Something dire.

What's worse, it feels like Freeza's Ki is still growing.

What is going on?

Where are you? Where are you, Bulma-san?!

No! I don't want to die here!

G-Gohan-kun! What have you guys been up to?!

I was beside myself with anxiety, you know!

And what's wrong with this planet?!

How could you leave me in a dangerous place like this?

What happened to Kuririn and Son-kun?

I'll explain later. Right now, we have to hurry.

Hurry? Where to?

Oh, the spaceship Son-kun came in, right?

We're going home, right?

--Y-Yes.
--Hooray!

Incredible. His Ki is swelling, and he's bulking up.

So this is his 100-percent power, at last.

What are you doing, Goku?!

Goku, can you hear me?! Hey!

Now! Now's your chance!

Now, while Freeza is focusing his power, is your chance to attack!

Goku! Can't you hear what I'm saying? I know you can!

Goku, it's now or never!

I hear you, Kaio-sama.

It's true, I may never have a chance like this again.

A chance to see the strongest dude in the universe at his full power.

W-What?!

Goku, do you even know what you're saying?

71... 72...

73...

74...

Hey! What has come over you?

L... l want to fight Freeza.

75... 76...

And...

...win!

W-What sort of nonsense is that?
This isn't a game! Goku? Goku!

I'm going to avenge Kuririn! He's died twice!

There ain't no bringing him back to life with the Dragon Balls!

Kuririn was a great guy! A really great guy!

He was my best friend!

And he blew him to bits.

Still, there's no reason to wait for him to reach full power.

Besides, what about Gohan and the others?

It's all right. Gohan and the others will be spared.

81%... 82%... Almost there...

Freeza, the reason I'm waiting for you to reach full power is so that I can beat the hell out of you at your best.

So that I'll have no regrets as a warrior.

You want to try out your full power yourself now, don't you?

Otherwise, you would have launched another shot, and put an end to everything!

K-Kaio-sama...

He is no longer Son Goku.
He's a warrior of rage, a Super Saiyan.


Do-or-Die Full Power of Freeza! Shenlong, Heed This Wish"   





Sorry to keep you waiting. This is the full power that you wanted.

There ain't no time.
Let's hurry up and settle this.

Too slow!

Behind you!

How do you like that?
That was just the warm-up for the final attack that I'm about to show you.

I'll bet.

I'd be disappointed if that was all you had.

Don't try to act so tough.

Death is all that remains for you!

You're not getting away!

Before you die, I've got to hand it to you for one thing...

You were great. Your strength is magnificent, Super Saiyan.

Truly the best in the universe...if it weren't for me, Freeza!

You fool! if you had just defeated Freeza before he reached his full power, you wouldn't be in this situation!

Kaio-sama? Kaio-sama?
It's the Kami of Earth. Kaio-sama?

I hear you. Was there something else?

I just received word from Mister Popo.

He has found the location of the last Dragon Ball.

And...?

Oh, right. He will have all seven together shortly, so we will be bringing Tenshinhan and Yamucha there back to life.

Oh, that's right, isn't it?

H-However, as I mentioned earlier, Chaozu, unfortunately enough...

Don't worry, Chaozu.

I'm staying here, too. The two of us will always be together, right?

No, Ten-san, you can't!

If you guys are staying here, then so am I.

What are you talking about? You have Bulma waiting for you, don't you?

--Yeah, but...
--Hold on! Hold on, hold on!

Hey, Kami of Earth, can your Dragon Balls bring back to life two people at once?

Y-Yes, as long as the terms are the same.

For example, as with this wish, if we ask for everyone killed by Vegeta and company to be brought back to life, it will work for many people.

Despite only granting one wish, compared to Planet Namek's Dragon Balls, yours are superior.

So, can they grant wishes on a world far removed from Earth?

Uh, probably.

Why would you ask such a thing?

Are you thinking of having everyone in the universe who was killed by Vegeta in the past brought back to life?

That should, of course, be possible, but it will only be effective for those who died within the last year.

There's one more thing I'd like to ask you.

Will they bring back to life those who have died of old age?

Unfortunately, no, they will not.
Not if it was a natural death.

However, what if they were confronted by an evil villain, and indirectly though it may be, had their lifespan shortened slightly as a result?

I'm not sure. Such would be a first-time case.

Well, I think that they would remain alive for the portion that their time had been shortened, though I have no positive proof.

Kaio-sama, what is it?

All right, that settles it!
Kami, change your wish!

Make it, "Bring back to life those who were killed by Freeza and his men," okay?

Those who were killed by Freeza and his men?

Kaio-sama, what exactly is going on?

There's no time, so I'll make this brief.

First, you use the Earth's Dragon Balls to bring back to life those who were killed by Freeza's party, namely, the Namekians.

Then, in all likelihood, the Grand Elder of Planet Namek will return to life, if only for a short time.

From this point on, I'm not too sure of everything myself, but of the three wishes that Namek's Dragon Balls grant, only two of them have been fulfilled.

Once the Grand Elder comes back to life, that remaining wish could be granted.

S-So then...?

With that remaining wish, we take everyone on Planet Namek, except for Freeza, and teleport them somewhere, like Earth!

Indeed, that is one play we could make.

Your resurrections would be put off considerably, though.

Would you put up with that?

I can't come back to life anyway, so...

Of course it's all right. it's only a year, isn't it?

It is a wonderful idea, Kaio-sama.

There you have it. So if you'll forgive me, please hurry.

Planet Namek itself is about to be wiped out.

Ls that right? Well then, I will relay that to Mister Popo at once.

Aren't we to Son-kun's spaceship yet?

We have to get off of this dangerous planet as soon as possible, or we'll never set foot on Earth's soil again.

Yes, I know.

Do you really?

You don't know the kind of hardship I've had to endure up to now.

Yes, I do know.

It was terrible! I was chased by dinosaurs, got body-swapped with a frog, and almost got crushed by rocks!

There it is! Over there!
That is Father's spaceship!

Hooray! Now we can go back to Earth, right?

Yes.

Hey, hold on! Where do you think you're going without us?

Bulma-san, hurry and come inside.

What is this? it's pitch-black in here, you know.

What's going on? This thing isn't on the fritz, is it?

That's strange. When I was here earlier, the lights were on.

Watch out!

The floor is on a slant, huh?

I'm not sure about this, but I'll try what I can.

Could it be this?

It's Piccolo! He's back alive?!

Yes, that's right.

What is he doing in here?

There is absolutely no way I can travel through space with Piccolo Daimao!

Piccolo-san helped save Father and me, so we're definitely bringing him back to Earth with us.

G-Gohan-kun, this world is Piccolo's home.

I'm sure he wants to stay here, doesn't he?

I-I'm kidding!

He's unconscious, and wouldn't attack a lady, right?

This world's end is near.

At most, it will last another two or three minutes.

You must be feeling rushed, Super Saiyan.

I get it. You're buying time to let those kids get away from the planet.

Well, no matter.

No sooner will they get away than they'll be my next target.

Their deaths will only be put off for a short while.

Buying time, you say? Ain't no need for that.

You're going to die. Right here, right now.

That's enough of your big talk!
I'm shutting you up, right now!

Are Gohan and the others still dragging their feet? Hurry it up!

What?!

We can't take anymore!

If we wait any longer, this ship won't be able to take off!

We're leaving!

We can't! Father is still out there!

Son-kun will be fine. No doubt he has some idea in mind.

Please, Bulma-san.
Please, wait... wait for Father.

Just a little while longer.

G-Gohan-kun...

Hold on, Piccolo. if you and I die now, all hope will be lost.

Kami-sama... Kami-sama...

Kami-sama, Dragon Balls gathered.
Can say wish any time.

All right.

Now, speak thy wish.
I shall grant thee any one wish.

Um, want to bring those killed by Freeza and men back to life.

This on faraway planet. Can you grant wish?

I know not. Yet I shall try.

Not know not good.

Have to have you do.

Call on you to do best.

See you in hell, Freeza!


Furious Battle Cry of Goku! Make It in Time... The Resurrection Wish!"   



Father, hang in there.

This is bad!

In a few minutes, this planet is going to undergo a huge explosion!

Full power!!

What?!

Well? Take that!

There's no way the likes of you could beat me, Freeza!

Father's... Father's Ki has vanished...

Huh? S-Son-kun is...

You don't think he's been done in, do you?

Bulma-san...

Please take Piccolo-san and head on back to Earth without me.

H-Hold on!

Wait!

Gohan-kun!

I am my father's... Son Goku's son.

Now, I... I have to fight Freeza.

You can't! There's no way you can beat him!

I'm sure Piccolo-san would tell me to do it, too.

Bulma-san, take care.

There's only one thing I can do!

W-What is going on?

Have we come back to life?

Something is wrong here.
What is with this earthquake?

A-And the sky is dark as well.
What exactly is going on?

W-Where am I? Am I alive?

I was successful.

Those on Planet Namek who were killed by Freeza and his men live once again.

Good work.

And now, farewell!

Oh, he did it!

He did it! Everyone has come back to life!

And the all-important Grand Elder?

What about Planet Namek's Super Shen Long?

It's all right, it has to be all right. The sky is dark.

The Super Shen Long is proof that the Grand Elder came back to life.

I'll confirm it now.

The sky...? What is this?

Is this a sign that the planet is about to explode?

It looks like I should get myself away from this planet right away.

If I get caught in the middle of the explosion, I'll lose a whole lot more of my strength.

W-What?!

What is this?

W-Why? Why am I back in mortality?

Good! Right according to plan!

Now, Kaio-sama, hurry!
Hurry and tell them the objective!

Right! The Grand Elder's life is running out again!

I know.

Grand Elder of Planet Namek, I am the Kaio of the Northern Galaxy.

Kaio-sama?

I want you to listen closely to what I'm about to say.

Now, you will face me!

Do you think a maggot like you can fight against me, Freeza?

How sad. You Saiyans can't help but fight, even when you're outmatched.

Now...

You, who are the last Saiyan, come at me!

What do you think you're doing?

Why, you little...!

Now then, what sort of death would you like?

I just have to keep Freeza busy for a few minutes...

By doing so, he'll be taken out with this planet when it explodes...

I know. I just had a great idea.

I'll stick you in the same grave as your father.

Well? Aren't you happy? You should be grateful for my benevolence.

All right, there's a little can-do spirit.

Just a little while... longer...

What the hell is he thinking?

So that's it!

I see what you're after now.

You're stalling for time.

Isn't that right?

You've realized that this world will only last a short while longer.

Y-You...

You, who killed Father, and Kuririn-san...

I'm not going to let you go on living!

Masenko!!

That's more like it. it's no fun otherwise.

Pretty good going, for a maggot.

But I'm through playing around now.
I may as well let you see...me, at my 100-percent power,
like I was when I killed your father.

Father... Piccolo-san...

it's over.

What?

Father!

Why haven't you gotten away?!

I told you to get out of here!

B-But...

--Go on!
--Right.

Father...

You're a pest who doesn't know when to die!

If you would have just remained dormant beneath the ground, you could have shared your fate with this planet.

You people from Earth are beyond foolish.

It's beyond the pale that you should be so uppity as to challenge me to battle.

It's your own swollen head that's beyond the pale.

What?!

Fine. I'll blow you to bits.

Just like I did to that earthling.

Like you did to that earthling?

You mean Kuririn?

You mean Kuririn?!

Grand Elder of Planet Namek, Namek could be annihilated at any moment.

You should have one wish to the Dragon Balls remaining.

Y-Yes, Kaio-sama.

Ask your Shen Long immediately to send everyone there, except for Freeza, to Earth.

I understand, Kaio-sama.
I am grateful for your concern.

However, one must convey their wishes to Shen Long directly.

I shall contact the one closest to him, and relay your--

No, don't do that!

Change that wish!

Goku? Are you listening in?

What's this?

Don't make it everyone there, except for Freeza-- change it to everyone there, except for Freeza and myself!

Goku, I know how you feel, but for now, you have to get to Earth.

If you don't let me settle things here with Freeza now...

...I will hold it against you for the rest of my life!

G-Goku!

Please, Kaio-sama!

But Goku...

Do it now! We ain't got any time left!

All right. Goku, I won't say another word.

Not if that's how badly you want this.

I was supposed to have been killed by Freeza, so why...?

The one closest to him is Dende, is it?

This is the Grand Elder.

So then, you are all right?
But what in the world...

Ask questions later. I have an urgent request for you.

Shen Long should be near you, waiting for the final wish.

Yes.

It's true, we have only had two of the wishes granted.

I want you to go to him at once, and tell him the third wish.

Yes, sir. But what is it?

The third wish is that you want to relocate everyone here, except for Freeza and the Saiyan named Son Goku, to Earth.

And Gohan-kun said that we were all ready to launch...

Is he really serious about fighting Freeza?

He should just get Son-kun and bring him back here right away.

I'm supposed to be dead.

Freeza saw to that.

Father...

Make sure you get back home alive, Goku.

Yeah. You know, you really racked your brains on this one, Kaio-sama.

So that's the Shen Long of Planet Namek, huh?

Now I can fight you without anything holding me back.

Th-That's what was coming from the Dragon Balls!

But the Dragon Balls were supposed to have turned to stone...!

Now's my chance!

Wait!

Do not interfere!

Where's Freeza? And Kakarrot?

Dende, it's up to you.

Please be in time.

Polunga!

Well? Have ye no other wish?

Y-Yes, I do!

If so, then speak it now!

Okay then, the third and final wish!

Make me, Freeza, immortal!

Oh, no!

Ah! Freeza!

Make me, Freeza, immortal!!

Poppolunga, Freeza pot Son Goku pupirito lonlonpa papipupo paro!

Very well, understood.

I shall remove all others to Earth, leaving these two behind.

Why, you little kid!

Freeza!

Vegeta...

Kakarrot! You finally became a Super Saiyan!

Y-You're here, too! Why?!

Why are you alive?!

Why, you...!

Farewell.

W-Wait!

Apparently, you didn't get your wish granted because you don't speak the language here.

That gave me a scare, too.

That was the kid that I killed, wasn't it?

They brought the folks you guys killed back to life using the Dragon Balls on Earth.

What?

And then, with the Dragon Balls here...

What was the wish that that kid had granted?!

He relocated everyone on this world to Earth, with the exception of you and me!

The planet has started to contract.

There are probably only two minutes before it explodes.

Will you be killed by me first, or will the planet explode first?

Either way, since you can't survive in the vacuum of space, your only choice is to die.

Maybe. But I've been waiting for this moment.

The moment when just the two of us can fight to our hearts' content.

Hmph, it sounds like you want to settle the score with me, Freeza, and you're prepared to give your life to do it.

Hand-to-hand combat, huh?

All right. You want to mix it up that badly, do you?


Two Remain on a Vanishing Planet! This Is the Final Showdown"   



Bulma-san!

G-Gohan-kun...

Gohan-kun, what was the big idea, making me wait all that time alone?

I'm sorry.

Where exactly are we?

It doesn't appear to be Planet Namek.

I was aboard the spaceship.

I don't see the spaceship around here.

I-It's you...

Where are we?

Son!

Piccolo-san!

--Gohan...
--Piccolo-san! Ah, Dende!

Am I dreaming?

Ow! This isn't a dream!

It looks like I've come back to life.

Then, has Kuririn-san, too?

I don't know.

Yeah, I guess not.

G-Grand Elder!

Grand Elder?

One way or another, you're going to be dead in a few minutes.

You poor, pathetic creature.

You're the pathetic one.
After all, you're the one who's about to be beaten by a detestable, simian Saiyan bastard.

Hmph, it doesn't matter how much bravado you put forth.

I'm the one who will be watching this planet explode!

Everyone, this is the planet Earth.

--Earth?!
--I-It can't be! How?

What has happened here?

My time is short, and I will once again be called away.

But before I die, I would like to relate to you what has just happened to us.

Where have Kakarrot and Freeza disappeared to?

Then, Father is still fighting Freeza on Planet Namek?

Grand Elder, do you know what has become of Planet Namek?

Unfortunately, I am no longer aware of the happenings on Namek.

No-Oh, no...

Son will be fine.

Piccolo-san...

Of course he'll be fine.

P-Piccolo-san...

Father...

Son-kun, don't you die.

Son...

Father!!

Hmph! There's no way I can lose to some monkey!

Not to a mere Saiyan monkey!

Goku! Goku!

Kaio-sama, what is happening?

Th-They're evenly-matched. Goku is fighting toe-to-toe against Freeza.

But there's no time left before Planet Namek explodes.

If their fight keeps going like this, it will play right into Freeza's hands.

How exactly do you mean?

When Planet Namek is destroyed, Goku will die.

However, Freeza will survive. 
He is able to live in any environment.

Kaio-sama, isn't there any way to save Goku?

This is the path that Goku chose for himself.

No-Oh, no...

--Yamucha!
--Goku!

S-Son...

How do you like this?! I will not be beaten by an inferior Saiyan!

Not by a lowly Saiyan!

You monkey!!

What are you doing, Bulma-san?

A little botanomancy. I learned how to do this when I was a child.

To pray for the safe return of a traveler, you put three leaves inside a circle and burn them.

They say that if the leaves all burn up, the traveler will come home safely.

Oh, and you're divining Goku's fate, right?

Look, they're burning!

I'm sure they'll all burn up.

Goku-san will be coming home, right?

Yeah! This kind of fortune-telling is always right!

Fortune-telling is a bunch of baloney!

Father is definitely coming home!

Yeah, you're right!

Father is going to beat Freeza and come home for sure!

How about that, you simian bastard?

Is that all you've got?

What?

I asked you if that was all you've got.

H-How insolent!

You simian bastard!

You're just a lowly Saiyan!

D-Damn it...

I'll pay you back for this tenfold--no, a hundredfold!

--I'm calling it.
--W-What?

W-What do you mean, you're calling it?

The backlash from you using your 100-percent power has you past your peak, and your Ki is dropping in a hurry.

I'm beginning to think there ain't no reason to fight you no further.

I'm satisfied. Your pride is already in tatters.

After all, someone showed up who surpassed you-- something you thought no one in the world could ever do.

What's more, he turned out to be...a "lowly Saiyan."

Now that you're this spooked, there ain't no point in defeating you.

You should go on living with that shock, quietly, in obscurity.

I'm going home to Earth.

If I leave now, I should still barely make it in time.

Freeza, don't you ever cause any trouble again.

I don't ever wanna see your face again.

Don't you screw around...

Don't you screw around with me!

I-I'm not...

I'm not...

...beaten!!

You're a complete and utter fool!

I gave you one last chance!

Freeza!!

That will follow you anywhere you go!

And it will also slice through anything!

Hmph! I see through your strategy!

You're going to come toward me, turning away at the last second, to try to get it to hit me, right?!

Do you think I'm going to fall for a two-bit tactic like that?!

Come on!

Gotcha!

Over here, Freeza!

Hmph, an afterimage, huh?

Not too shabby, monkey.

Sure enough, I have absolutely no desire to fight you now.

Not if you're pinning your hopes on a bush-league move like that.

If you really want to settle this, build up your strength again, and hone your skills some more.

A bush-league move, is it?

Goku! There's no time!
Planet Namek is going to explode!

Father!!

M-My technique is a bush-league move, is it?

Then how about two of them?!

You just don't get it.

Monkey, those will follow you no matter where you go!

You think you can get away from them? You'll be cut to pieces!

Freeza, you never learn!

Hmph! The same pattern, huh?
You've got no style!

Damn it! I am not falling for that childish trick!

Where are you, you simian bastard?!

You're no match for me!

I will not be shown up by any simian bastard!

Don't get up! Stay down!

I-It can't be...!

K-Kaio-sama, what is the matter?

D-Don't tell us Goku has lost!

F-Freeza has been...

...cut in half...


The Final Blow, Son Goku... Planet Namek Scatters Throughout Space" 




Sure, you may have brought that upon yourself, but it ain't like you to meet such a miserable end.

I'll get back to Earth somehow.

You'll share the same fate as the planet that you yourself destroyed.

Help...

H-Help...

H-Help... m-me...

Goku, what are you waiting for?
Get out of there, now!

P-Please... h-h...

...help... me...!

Help...

Help... me...!

It's always about you!

How many... How many people have you killed as they begged for their lives, like you're doing?!

Please... help me...!

Please...!

Freeza...

I've shared a small amount of my Ki with you.

You should be able to get around well enough, even in your shape.

You can manage the rest on your own!

This is unexpected.

Y-You, sharing your energy with me...you simian bastard...!

You can survive in the vacuum of space, right?

Then hurry up and get off of this planet.

Live on, and fully realize how precious life is!

P-Planet Namek here is just moments from exploding.

Where do you think you're going?

No matter what you do, you can't live in the vacuum of space.

Death is all that awaits you.

There's no more time before it explodes!

You don't have any time to make it back to your spaceship!

And Vegeta has wrecked the spaceship that I came in.

You Saiyans really are simian bastards!

You can't get off of this planet!

You're going to perish, right along with it!

How ironic. You, who won the fight, will die, while I will be spared!

Th-That's what you get for being so insolent as to share your energy with me, Freeza.

I'll survive, just you watch.

I'm calling it.

W-What?

W-What do you mean, you're calling it?

I'm beginning to think there ain't no reason to fight you no further.

You should go on living with that shock, quietly, in obscurity.

S-Simian bastard...!

I am the greatest in the universe!

I am the cosmic emperor, Freeza!

Th-That's why you...you simian bastard...must die by my hand!

Y-You...deserve...deserve...to be killed by me!

You dumb-ass!!

Here...

Th-Thank you.

Wait up!

Up here!

It appears that my time is almost here.

G-Grand Elder!

G-Grand Elder...!

--Grand Elder!
--Grand Elder!

Grand Elder!

G-Gather... Gather everyone here.

Right!

--Grand Elder!
--Grand Elder!

It would seem that the time has come for me to take my leave.

I-I am glad that I was able to live a full life.

Muri-sama!

Yes, what did you find?

Sure enough, we cannot locate anyone from Elder Tsuno's village.

What could have become of them?

Those are probably the guys from the village that I wiped out.

The wish to the Dragon Balls was to bring back to life everyone that was killed by Freeza and his men, right?

Hmph, I am not one of Freeza's men.
Botched that one up, huh?

Oh, the Dragon Balls appear... to have followed us here.

G-Grand Elder...!

A-As I said earlier, my time is now all but up.

M-Muri...

Y-Yes?

Hold... Hold out your hand.

Right.

F-From here on, you will be the Grand Elder.

I-In time, the Dragon Balls will once again regain their brilliance.

Use the Dragon Balls well.

Y-Yes, as you wish.

I-I leave you to it.

Grand Elder!

P-Peace on Namek, forever...

Grand Elder!

Grand Elder...

G-Grand Elder...

G... Grand Elder...

Grand Elder, may you rest in peace.

I-I now understand clearly, Piccolo-san.

You merged with Nail-san, didn't you?

G-Guys!

The Grand Elder is now gone. 
Let those of us who are left behind join together to usher in an everlasting peace!

--Right!
--Indeed!

The Grand Elder has passed away, and Kuririn-kun won't be coming back, either, huh?

No. Someone who has been returned to life with the Dragon Balls cannot be brought back a second time.

Eh? it's all right!

Namek's Dragon Balls can restore life again and again!

As long as it wasn't a natural death, there's probably no limit.

So then... then...

Dende, when the day comes that we can have our wishes granted by your Dragon Balls again, we can bring Kuririn-san, Chaozu-san, and the others back to life, too!

Father, be sure you come back!

Let's call back Kuririn-san together, using Planet Namek's Dragon Balls!

Kaio-sama, just what is going on?

What's happening to Goku and Freeza?

Freeza is dead.

As Freeza begged for his life, Son Goku shared some of his Ki with him, giving him a chance to live, but he...Freeza used it to attack Goku.

And so, Goku had no choice but to finish him off.

Then, Goku's victory is complete!

Mm-hmm, Freeza was no match for Goku, once he became a Super Saiyan.

He did it!

That's how incredible a Super Saiyan is?

That means Goku's strength is the greatest in the universe.

It seems like he's become someone from a world far away.

However... However...he may only be the best in the universe for a brief moment.

How so?

Planet Namek's explosion is closing in.

There isn't time for Goku to reach the spaceship he came in.

He is headed for Freeza's spaceship, which is nearby, but it appears to be broken down, as well.

H-Hey, this is Goku. I'm sure he'll scrape through somehow.

I mean, he's gotten out of pinches like this time and again.

Besides, right now, Goku is a Super Saiyan. Am I right?

Y-Yeah!

Goku, hurry! Just hurry!

All right!

Please, let me be in time!

Where's the control room?!

All right, good! it's almost the same as the spaceship I came in!

Where's the takeoff button?!

Here!

Start up!

Please, start up!

Start up! Start up, damn it!
Start up! Start up!

Start up! Start up! Start up! Start up!

How can this be...? How can this--

What happened, Kaio-sama?!

His last remaining hope, Freeza's spaceship...

...has been swallowed up by lava...!

So then, what about Goku-san?

He can't make it back. All he can do is share Planet Namek's fate.

It's going to explode. 
Planet Namek is going to explode.

Damn it all!!

I can't watch!

Goku...

Goku... Don't you die...

Don't you die!!

Damn it all!!


Goku Vanishes in Space... Return to Life! Super Warriors"   




Kaio-sama...

Is Goku really...?

Sure enough, there's no hope.

Damn it! Goku!

He really is dead, then?

What a shame.

We'll have to inform Goku's son on Earth of his father's death.

This will be hard on him.

What if we have Bulma-san tell him?

All right.

Please, let me be the one to tell her.

Okay then, Yamucha.

Well then, if you would...

Right.

Bulma... Bulma, can you hear me?

Bulma...

Can you hear me, Bulma?

It's me, Yamucha.

Huh? Yamucha?

That's right. it's Yamucha.

I'm speaking directly into your mind through Kaio-sama.

Into my mind?

Really?

What is it, Bulma-san?
By any chance, is that Kaio-sama?

That's what he said.
I'm impressed that you knew.

Yamucha is the one speaking right now.

So, are you doing well, Yamucha?

Mm-hmm. I am still dead, but I'm doing fine, otherwise.

But never mind me, I want you to keep calm and listen to me.

It's about Goku.

Goku defeated Freeza. B-But then...

Hey, everyone, listen up! He says that Son-kun has taken down Freeza!

Really, Bulma-san? Hooray! Hooray!

Hooray! Hooray!

He has, huh? Son, you finally did it.

Father has won! He won!

Freeza, beaten by Kakarrot?

Be quiet and listen to me.
There's more than just that.

After he defeated Freeza, Goku...desperately tried to get away, but...he didn't make it before Planet Namek exploded...and he died.

Hey, hold up, everyone.

He says that Son-kun died when Planet Namek exploded.

That's a shocker, huh?

You dumb-ass! How can you put it like that?!

Think about Gohan, will you?!

Goku can never come back again!

You don't know what's what.

We have the Dragon Balls from Planet Namek.

The Dragon Balls came to Earth together with the Namekians.

This will surprise you!

They say that the Namekian Dragon Balls can bring people back to life over and over again!

In other words, Son-kun, Kuririn-kun, and Chaozu-kun can all come back to life again.

I-Is that right?!

What is it, Yamucha?

We're all coming back to life!
Including you, Chaozu.

Really?

It's the folks on Earth who don't know what's what.

Sure, Chaozu can be brought back to life with the Namekian Dragon Balls.

But as for Goku and Kuririn...

What about Goku and Kuririn, Kaio-sama?

The Dragon Balls bring the dead back to life where they died.

Which means...?

Goku and Kuririn would come back to life on Planet Namek.

However, Planet Namek is no longer there!

It's now just the vacuum of space.

Death would be waiting for them the moment they returned to life.

Kaio-sama, with your power, can't you... can't you do anything?

I can do nothing. That place is not under my jurisdiction.

H-He says that Son-kun... can't come back.

No-Oh, no...!

W-Why is it that Father and Kuririn-san can't come home alive?

It sounds like if Kami-sama regenerated your body, like in Chaozu-kun's case, and you're there at Kaio-sama's place, you'd be fine, but otherwise, you come back to life wherever you died.

But Son-kun and Kuririn-kun died on Planet Namek, and...

Planet Namek isn't there anymore, right?

It's just the vacuum of space.

What's more, apparently, Kaio-sama isn't in charge of the area where Planet Namek is.

No-Oh, no...

Why don't you try using your heads for a minute?

You can just relocate their souls, or whatever they are, here to Earth, and then revive them, right?

More than likely.

Yeah! He's right!

That's a pretty good idea you had, isn't it?

Thank you very much.

Don't get carried away.

I just want to see Kakarrot, now that he's a Super Saiyan.

And then, someday, I'll beat him. I swear it!

E-Excuse me, my earthling friend...

Once the Dragon Balls of Namek are restored, we plan to locate a suitable world and relocate there.

Could you direct us to a place where we can spend our time until then?

Well, okay.

In that case, you can stay at my home.

Are you sure about that?

It's a huge place, so no problem.

Besides, we'd like to make use of your Dragon Balls a little bit more.

Do it! Right, Dende-kun?

Sure...if this many of you are spotted loitering around, it will create a huge uproar.

That's true enough.
Okay, we'll take you up on it.

How about you coming, too?

After all, you've got no hotel money, right?

I'll feed you plenty.

I'll bet you're just like Son-kun, and eat like crazy, right?

But no matter how attractive I might be, no hanky panky, okay?

V-Vulgar woman! Keep your voice down.

Okay, everyone, sit tight for a minute.

I'll go hunt down a phone somewhere and have my dad come.

U-Um, Bulma-san...

Could I maybe stay over at your place, too, Bulma-san?

Gohan-kun, you have your own house, don't you?

You should go home. Your mother must be worried about you.

Yeah, well, you see...

I forgot to do my homework... and Mother will be angry with me.

Faster! Faster! Doesn't this thing have more speed?!

Aw, geez...

Ah, he's here! He's here, he's here!

Here we are! Here! Here! Here we are!

Gohan-chan!

Where is Gohan-chan?!

Gohan-chan!

Mother, I'm home.

And so, the Namekians were taken to the Capsule Corporation.

This is my home. What do you think?
Pretty cushy place, huh?

Is that...?

And so, the Namekians ended up staying at Bulma's home until the Dragon Balls became reactivated.

And then, in no time at all, days had passed.

Wow. The Namekian Dragon Balls reactivate after only days, huh?

That's right. A Namekian year is days, after all.

That's about one-third of what it is on Earth. Nice, isn't it?

Well, let's make our wishes to Super Shen Long, right away.

J-Just a minute. Gohan isn't here yet.

Hey! Hold up a sec!

--Hey, Gohan!
--Hey, Gohan!

Sorry, my cram school ran a little long.

You're going to cram school again? What a little trooper.

I want to have my Gohan-chan study like crazy, so he'll end up becomin' a great scholar.

Well, we were just about to get started.

Okay, Dende-kun, if you please.

Right.

Takkaraputo Poppolunga pupirito paro!

Whoo! Whoo!

So this is the original Shen Long...

Wow, this is incredible!

Oh, my!

Thou who hast gathered the seven Dragon Balls, I shall grant thee any three wishes.

My earthling friend, we can go next time.

Go ahead and have your wishes granted.

Thank you very much, Grand Elder.

All right then, we'll make our wishes.

First, summon the souls of Son Goku and Kuririn, who died on Planet Namek, to come here.

Napahito sonda bakuli lepicatto sopaletto!

Understood. I shall try.

I have called hither the soul of the one called Kuririn.

However, I cannot call forth the soul of the one called Son Goku.

Huh? No-Oh, no! Why not?

Because Son Goku is alive.
I cannot call forth only his soul.

H-H-He's alive?

W-What?

H-He couldn't be. How?

--Yay! Yay!
--Yay! Yay!

Hooray!

If he's alive, I wonder why he hasn't come home.

His spaceship is probably damaged or something.

Oh, in that case, you can ask Polunga to summon him here.

Yeah, right!

Yay!

Okay then, first, the second wish.

--Go on! Go on!
--Bring Kuririn back to life.

Papitto latonguge Kuririn barsatto!

H-Huh?

Kuririn-san!

No-Oh, right. I've come back to life.

--Hooray!
--Yay! Yay!

As a special deal, I have restored his dismembered body to its original form.

You may have a stern face, but you do good work, don't you?

Now then, finally, pick up Son-kun and deliver him here!

--Hooray!
--Yay! Yay!

Hirokelotto deliba milocasuta pippo!

Goku-sa...

I cannot.

I have been denied.

The man named Son says that he will return on his own in due time.

D-Denied? But why?

I know why!

He's afraid of his wife!
The strongest one in the universe is Super Saiyan Son Goku's wife!

J-Joking! I'm joking!

F-Father isn't coming back?

He said he would come back on his own in due time.

He's definitely coming home.

I get it. He's training on another planet, with plans to power up even more.

I can't just stick around here, spinning my wheels!

Oh, dear...

Pay him no mind.

Keep going. instead of Son, bring back to life someone at Kaio's place.

Yeah, right. I wonder who we should ask for.

They say they want to call one of you back.

What should we do?

I want to train here for a little while longer.

I-I'd like to stay with Ten-san.

Okay then, Yamucha, you're the one to go.

Me first, huh? Sorry, guys.

All right. Well then...

Bulma... Bulma...

Bulma, it's me. Do you know who I am?

Kaio-sama?

Tenshinhan and Chaozu will be staying over here a little longer.

Bring Yamucha back to life.

Yamucha, huh? Okay.

All right, the third wish. Once more, please!

Bring Yamucha back to life!

Pipatto dominori keludemine coalutto!

All right, understood.

I have brought the man called Yamucha back to life.

--Where? Huh? W-Where is he?
--Where? Where?

I have now granted all of thy wishes. Farewell!

J-Just a minute!

Aw, he's gone. Where is Yamucha?

Over here!

Ribbit-ribbit!

Yamucha-sama!

--Ribbit... ribbit...
--Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

Pu-erh...

Yamucha...

As long as you were going to bring me back, I wish you could have picked a better spot.

And so, another days passed.

With the first wish, Chaozu...

--Yahoo!
--Welcome home!

...and with the second wish, Tenshinhan came back to life.

Ten-san...

--Ten-san! Ten-san!
--Chaozu...

And then...

Okay, Dende, it's time for us to take our leave.

R-Right.

Thank you very much, everyone.

T-Take care, okay?

Gohan-san, goodbye.
I've really enjoyed myself.

Dende...?

Dende...

Picoleto camuleo zecanpile...

I shall grant that wish.

Goodbye.

Goodbye...

Goodbye!

G-G...

Goodbye...

With the third wish, the Namekians moved to another world.

Let's see...

And so, for a short while, the peace on Earth continued. However...


That's Earth, Papa... Freeza and His Father Strike Back"   




A year had passed since Son Goku managed to defeat Freeza, following a pitted battle.

However, Son Goku still had not returned to Earth.

Gohan-chan, are you studyin'?

Huh? Mother...

it sure is nice being at peace, huh?

I have to wonder, though, where did Vegeta go off to?

He's probably zipping around the universe, chasing after Goku.

He sure doesn't give up easy.

I get shivers down my spine just looking at him.

If you look closer, he's a surprisingly good man.

How so? He's a spaceship thief!

He's pretty daring, going to such lengths to chase after Son-kun, isn't he?

Hey, Bulma, are you--

Yamucha, don't be jealous, don't be jealous.

I-I'm not jealous.

From what Papa was saying, he should be running out of fuel soon.

I wonder if he met up with Son-kun.

Ka... me...ha... me...Ha!!

Damn it!

It's no use! At this level, I don't even hold a candle to Goku!

The time when Muten Roshi was hailed as the world's greatest

is now well in the past.

Now, you're just a dirty old man.

Goku is probably out there somewhere in space, still training.

Oh, dear! The spaceship thief came back!

Vegeta, what do you want?!

Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

It looks like Kakarrot still hasn't returned.

So you didn't run into Goku out in space, then?

I have no need to answer you.

Now, now, that's enough chit-chat.

Come on, how about you take a shower?

Good grief, you're so dirty.

Come on, this way.

Hurry along, now. You're being impolite in front of a lady.

What?!

What the...?

Vegeta is at her beck and call.

Oh, dearie-dear.

I'm leaving a change of clothes here for you.

Get back here quick, Kakarrot.
Show me the power of a Super Saiyan!

Kakarrot!

Oh, it was Vegeta, was it?

I was positive that Goku had come back.

Goku is still the only thing on Vegeta's mind right now.

He wouldn't do anything to bring harm upon us, right?

I don't know.

Woman! Earth woman!

Where are you?! Hey, woman!

Do you hear me, Earth woman?!

Listen here! My name is Bulma.

You will call me by my name. How rude!

What have you done with my clothes?

They were dirty, so I washed them.

Y-You what?!

There's a change of clothes there, right?

You would have me, the prince of the warrior Saiyan race, wear something like this?!

You could always go naked.

Damn it, you're making a fool of me!

Th-This is...

Oh, my, it looks surprisingly good on you, doesn't it?

Don't laugh! if you value your lives, do not laugh!

Why don't you stay here until Son-kun comes back?

If you stay here, you'll know as soon as Son-kun comes back.

Do you feel that, Gohan? That incredible Ki?

Yes.

Th-This isn't a very nice Ki, either, is it?

No, it's not. it's getting closer in a hurry, too.

You must be vaguely sensing it, too...

This Ki belongs to Freeza, doesn't it?

I-It can't be...

But then, sure enough...

it's not just one. There's another ridiculously huge Ki.

No-Oh, no...

H-How can this be?

Kakarrot, you punk! You didn't finish him off, did you?!

A-Are you sure this Ki belongs to Freeza?

Do you think I could be mistaken about this, you dumb-ass?!

Impossible! I-I'm sure Goku killed off Freeza back then.

That there is Earth, Papa.

It looks like we're going to arrive before the Super Saiyan who put me through all this does.

It's a small planet.

We could just wipe it out with one shot.

That would not leave me satisfied.

I want to show him something--my powered-up form.

Hmph, you mean this so-called Super Saiyan?

I see you on radar. You're flying to Earth, too.

I'll show you soon enough...

...who the real strongest man in the universe is!

Oh, no! Oh, no!

Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

Gohan-chan!

H-Hold on, Gohan-chan! Where are you goin'?!

Today's the day your new private tutor is comin' over!

H-How can this be happening?

This is terrible, Father!

That's Kuririn-san's Ki!

--Yo!
--Kuririn-san, are you sensing this?

The thing of it is...

...there's no way I couldn't sense this.

After all, I've experienced the effects of his Ki firsthand.

Goku!!

What in the world is going on?

Does this mean that Father didn't defeat Freeza, Kuririn-san?

That's what I'd like to know.
I have no idea what's going on!

To think that Freeza would still be alive...

Then Kakarrot didn't finish the job after all?

I have to wonder, though--who is that who's with Freeza?

The one whose Ki is far greater than even his?

It's not so bad traveling around the frontier once in a while, huh?

You sure do seem fired up, Freeza.

This opponent can't be anyone who would get you this worked up, can it?

I'm so excited, I can't help myself, Papa.

I'd like to hop up and down, and start dancing.

Great King Cold, Freeza-sama, we will now commence landing on Earth.

They should probably set down around here somewhere.

Are you sure about that?

You keep quiet, you know-nothing!

I've actually fought against him!

Hey!!

It's Bulma!

Vegeta! Yamucha! Yoo-hoo!

Yamucha-sama!

W-What are you guys doing here?!

We came to see this Freeza guy.

I never even saw him once when I was on Planet Namek.

Came to see him? You must realize how dangerous he is, right?!

I do realize, which is why I came.

If Freeza felt like it, all of Earth would go kaboom, right?

It would be the same no matter where we are.

So I wanted to know what kind of guy he was.

Hmph, apparently, she's more than just vulgar.

The woman's got guts.

Tenshinhan! Chaozu!

Vegeta, you've come back to Earth again?

Sounds like you've got something to say to me.

You bet I do.

After all, we were killed by you guys.

I don't know how Yamucha can bring himself to live together with you.

--Hmph, you guppy.
--What?!

N-Now, hold on. This isn't the time for this.

This is a real mess, huh? Is it Freeza?

Yeah, apparently so.

Don't just stand there talking--mask your battle powers already!

You nitwits! They're going to have Scouters.

The Namekian there has long since done so.

Namekian?

Piccolo!

How long has he been over there?

Gohan, everyone's over there!

Piccolo-san is there, too!

Everyone else has sensed it, too.

--Guys!
--Yoo-hoo!

Kuririn-kun, Gohan-kun!

Gohan, is Goku...?

So he hasn't come back yet, after all.

Here they come!

They're landing!

Great King Cold, Freeza-sama, touchdown complete.

N-No doubt about it. it's Freeza. H-He's alive.

What's worse, there's someone else in there besides Freeza, all right.

Listen up, you guys! Do not fly!

Walk up closer, so that they don't detect you on their Scouters!

--Ready to go?
--Yes!

H-Hold on.

Freeza has a Ki that's that ridiculously, unbelievably huge?

It isn't just that.

He gets much, much stronger.

Y-You've gotta be kidding.

What good will it do for us to get closer?

H-He's an unbelievable monster, isn't he?

And there are two of them.

Th-There's nothing that we can do, is there?

Then what are you going to do?

Sit here and rot? Suit yourself.

We all know there's nothing to be done.

Shall I just spell it out for you?

The Earth is now finished!

Earth, huh? Not a bad little planet.

The earthlings don't matter to me, but I'm going to make sure we choke the life out of the Super Saiyan, no matter what methods it may require.

The one who has the greatest power in the universe must be one of our clan.

Papa, if you and I gang up on him, we're sure to defeat him.

I've also powered-up. I could probably even take him by myself.

Well now, we have three hours until the Super Saiyan returns here.

Shall we wait for him, Freeza?

Of course we will, Papa.

But I want him to be mortified when he gets here, so I'm going to kill all of the earthlings.

There seem to be a fairly large number of people here, but three hours should be plenty of time.

Take that, Son Goku!

I've crawled up from the depths of hell to take revenge against you!

Damn it, I just barely got brought back to life, and now I'm going to die again?

All right, men, fan out and kill every last earthling.

--Go!
--Yes, sir!

Is there something you needed, earthling?

I've come here to kill you.


I'll Defeat Freeza! Another Super Saiyan" 
  



Is there something you needed, earthling?

I've come here to kill you.

What did you just say?

I've come here to kill you.

You say you've come to kill... us?

Papa...

it sure is nice not to know anything, huh?

Oh, I know.

You're Freeza, right?

There's no reason to be surprised.
I know all about you.

Hmph, what an honor.

To think that my name is known
in these outskirts of the galaxy.

But unfortunately for you,
you don't seem to be aware

that I possess the greatest
power in the universe.

I know that you're going to die here, as well.

What utter gibberish.

--Deal with him.
--Yes, sir.

The rest of you, go dispose
of the earthlings at once!

Yes, sir!

You guys had best not do anything pointless.

Or you're going to die here, as well.

You're too much, kid!

Hey, hold it! This one is mine.

Hmph, battle power of just .

What trash. This is going to
hurt a bit, but just be patient.

It will all be over soon.

You little punk!

Looks like you can handle yourself somewhat.



W-What? What's wrong, everyone?

A-A tremendously huge Kijust appeared...

...and a lot of other Ki vanished in an instant...

W-What in the world is going on?

Huh? What are you saying?

What is going on on the other side of that mountain?

You're not too shabby, are you?

For an earthling, that is.

Now it's your turn.

Hoho, this is a surprise.
Did you hear that, Freeza?

It sounds like he's planning to kill us next.

Hmph, he's in way over his head.

Let me fill you in on a little something.

Those who achieve power by halves are the ones who meet the earliest deaths.

Hmph, you mean like you?

W-What did you say?!

I'm surprised you would have the nerve to come to Earth, after being reduced to the state that you're in...just so you could be killed.

You sure have a big mouth, kid.

Papa, it looks like he needs to be spanked.

As much as he has insulted you, I would say it is punishable by death.

It's more than you deserve, but I will serve as your executioner.

You should be honored.

You are going to be killed by me, in the blink of an eye.

That's what I know.

That's what you know?

Hmph, that's a unique turn of phrase.

Come at me with everything you've got, right from the start.

I won't be as easy on you as Son Goku-san was.

Son Goku?

That's the name of the Super Saiyan, Papa.

I see, so you're friends with him, are you?

We've never met. I just know of him.

Ho, you just know of him.

You said something earlier, remember?

You were going to kill all of the earthlings before the Super Saiyan arrived, so that he would be mortified.

That's what I said, all right.
You're one of them, too.

Although, since you've killed all of my men, I, Freeza, will have to take care of it by my own hand.

Hmph, you've figured wrong.

Oh? I could sweep up all of the trash here on Earth in no time at all.

That's not what I meant.

Your error, the one I'm speaking of...is that Son Goku-san is not the only Super Saiyan there is.

There is another one, right here.

What?!

This is a surprise.

I admire the fact that you would carry your bluff this far.

I-It can't be...

What's this?

W-What is this Ki?!

What is this? it's just like it was on Planet Namek, isn't it?!

It's Father...

--What?!
--It's the same as Father's Ki back then!

Th-Then...

A S-Super Saiyan? Impossible!

Another Super Saiyan besides Kakarrot?

This is a Super Saiyan?

Those eyes...!

Those are the eyes...!

What are you so scared of?

Go to hell!

I-It's started!

Damn it!

Don't fly!

I told you, they have Scouters!

If they detect us, we're done for!

If you want to get closer, you have to walk!

Kuririn-san!

G-Gohan, where is Goku, and what is he doing right now?

I hate to say this, but this is far more than we can handle.

Even after Goku finally gets back, the Earth may not be here!

Damn it!

Vegeta, you can do something, can't you?

Silence! Unless you want to die alongside us, go back to your home!

You made it back from Planet Namek, after all.

You have to know that much, no matter how dumb you may be.

Vegeta, you can't call Bulma dumb right to her face.

You tell him, Yamucha!

Yeah. She's just the biggest rubbernecker on Earth, not to mention a shrew.

Hold on!

You're not exactly backing me up here, you know!

Oh? I'm not?

Geez, what's your problem, Yamucha?!

What's so funny, the rest of you?

This could be the last laugh we ever have, huh?

Damn it!

H-Hold on!

Geez, I can't believe they would leave a lady behind like this.

Bulma-san, let's go home now.

You expect me to go home, after coming this far?!

Who do you think I am?

I am the great Bulma, and I have survived...

...scenes as dangerous as this one...

...time and again!

Come on! Hey, Vegeta! Take me with you!

After everything I've done for you!

Freeza, if you destroy this planet, it will defeat our whole purpose.

This Son Goku guy won't be coming back here.

I know, Papa. I wasn't hitting him with everyth--

You can't afford to take me lightly and hold back any of your power.

You will be killed by me, after all.

You've got a big mouth, kid! Take this!

Foolish Freeza, your arrogant conceit really will be the death of you.

A fight is something you settle all at once.

Hmph, then, as you wish, I will finish you, all at once!

Freeza! Are you trying to obliterate this planet?!

We can always dispose of Son Goku out in space!

The planet is going to explode! Freeza, let's go!

W-What?!

Y-You don't know when to die!

What's the matter? Are you done already?

You got him, Freeza.

He really wasn't any match for us.

Hmph, I got in some good exercise before Son Goku got here.

Freeza!

You think you can get me with something like that?

What?!

Ah, Kuririn-san, over there!

N-No doubt about it, that was Freeza just now.

He took Freeza apart... in no time flat...

What kind of eyes do you guys have?

I'm surprised you can see that.

Then again, Son-kun really has gotten incredibly strong, huh?

He just beat Freeza in the blink of an eye, right?

The Earth has been saved once again, hasn't it?

That guy isn't Goku.

He does appear to be a Super Saiyan, though.

Piccolo-san!

--Me, too!
--Me, too!

All right, I'm going, too!

Wait up!

Don't leave me here in a place like this!

Wow, this feels great!

Yahoo!

You're pretty good, aren't you? Outstanding.

A Super Saiyan truly is more than I imagined.

To think that you could eliminate my son, Freeza, quick as a flash...

What would you say about taking Freeza's place as my son?

You, the strongest in the universe, are indeed fit to become one of my clan.

All of the worlds that are even more magnificent than Earth here would be yours to do with as you like.

Not interested.

I thought it sounded pretty good.

That's a shame.

By the way, that sword you've got there is quite fine.

It must be, to slice through Freeza's well toned body so easily.

Would you mind letting me see it?

What's the matter? Are you afraid to hand over your sword to me?

Indeed.

It appears to be well honed.

I have to say, it must be because you had this sword that you were able to defeat Freeza.

Don't you think so?

What are you trying to say?

Oh...it's simple, really.

I'm saying that without this sword, you will be unable...to defeat me!

Apparently, it wasn't just the sword, huh?

W-W-Wait!

S-Spare me... P-Please!

Spare me!

I-I know... I'll give you one of my planets...!

N-No, all the planets in this solar system...!

S-So, please...!

W-Who on earth is he?!

I'm now going to head off to meet Son Goku-san!

Would you like to come with me?

What?!

H-How... How does he know about Father?

This way.

Son Goku-san should be arriving in this area shortly.

Who is this guy?

A Super Saiyan? Him?! You gotta be kidding!

There's no way there can be any other Saiyans besides us!

Son Goku-san will be arriving in three hours.

Please, follow me.

I'm... I'm going to follow that man.

Y-Yeah, but...we don't know anything about him!

I'm going, too. He killed Freeza and the others, and knows Son Goku. I doubt he's a bad guy.

Besides, I'm also curious.

Is he really going to greet Goku?

I wonder how he knows him. Weird, huh?

I think I'll go, too. I'm going to expose who he really is.

H-Hey, wait up!


Welcome Back Son Goku! The Confession of the Mysterious Young Boy Trunks"   



Point -354...

Then, right around here.

There is still some time before Son Goku-san arrives.

I have plenty of drinks here, so if you like, help yourselves.

I'll have something.

--Me, too.
--H-Hey, Gohan...

I'll have something here.
Let's see, which will it be...?

Huh? Do we have these in our product line?

Wow, this is delicious!

Yeah, you're right.

Maybe I'll have something, too.

Have we ever met anywhere before?

Eh? N-No, not really.

How do you know my father?

I've only ever heard stories about him. I haven't met him yet.

So, how do you know that Goku will be coming here in three hours?

W-Well... I'm sorry, I cannot say.

What do you mean, you can't say?

Who the hell are you? How did you get that kind of power?

Um, when you defeated Freeza and the other one, you were a Super Saiyan, weren't you?

Uh, y-yes, I was.

Get real!

The Saiyans consist of me and Kakarrot, who goes by the name Son Goku here on Earth, and the earthling half-breed kid there.

There aren't any others left besides us three!

So there's no way you can be a Saiyan!

B-But the fact remains, he actually did turn Super Saiyan, and he defeated Freeza.

And Saiyans are supposed to all have black hair.

Huh? Say, that's our Capsule Corporation logo, isn't it?

How come? Are you one of our employees?

N-No, it's not like that.

That's a secret, too?

So are your name and age confidential, as well?

I cannot tell you my name, but I am years old.

Odd that he won't tell us his name.

Yeah. There's no reason for him to hide it.

Say, let's stop asking him questions.

He's getting flustered, you know.

This boy just saved us, and the whole Earth.



Um, Piccolo-san, there's something I've wanted to ask you for a while now...

What is it?

A year ago, when Dende-kun and the others from Planet Namek relocated to another planet, why didn't you go with everyone else, Piccolo-san?

No earth-shattering reason.

It's because I couldn't take that boring life, with no stimulation.

So then, even now, you're spending every day in intensive training?

You got it.

Vegeta is gone all day long, too.

I'm sure he's off training somewhere.

Yeah. I bet even now, he's still thinking of defeating Goku.

The guy has an incredible amount of pride.

I hear he was once the Saiyan prince.

Don't you think they look alike?

Who?

That mysterious boy and Vegeta.

Look, there's just something about them.

I don't know, maybe they're a little alike.

Why do you keep staring at me like that?

If you really are a Saiyan, I can't be anything new, right?

I-I'm sorry.

He came to know Son Goku on some planet out in space.

Would that be so hard to imagine?

But he seems to be right at home here on Earth.

Three hours have passed.

Son Goku-san should be arriving any moment now.

R-Really?

H-He's right!

I sense it! I sense a Ki!

Something is definitely coming.

Th-Then, the time and place that boy told us were right on the money?

It's Father! it's Father's Ki!

He's here!

--Over there!
--W-Wait up!

Wait up, I say!

H-Hold on!

Down there!

--Huh?
--Hooray!

--Father!
--Goku!

What are you guys doing here?

Welcome home, Father!

Hooray! Hooray!

Hooray!

How did you guys know I would be landing here?

This boy, this boy! He told us you would be coming back here!

Father, you know who he is, right?

No, who is he?

You mean, you don't know who he is at all?

Nope, I don't know him at all.

He knew that you'd be coming here right at this time, Son-kun.

Really? That's strange. Freeza and them detected my spaceship, and it looked like they knew when I was gonna arrive on Earth.

I have to wonder, though: who was it who defeated Freeza and them?

That was an amazing Ki! Was it you, Piccolo?

Or was it you, Vegeta?

He's the one who dealt with Freeza and the others.

In the blink of an eye, at that.

And he can turn Super Saiyan, like you do.

Super Saiyan?

Wow, that's amazing! And you're so young, too.

I have to say, I didn't know there were any other Saiyans besides us.

You're wrong! There are definitely no other Saiyans besides us!

Well, I guess it don't really matter.

Yes, it does matter.
You're just as carefree as ever.

I am?

Son-san...

I actually need a word with you.

With me?

Yes. Just the two of us.

All right.

What, this is confidential from the rest of us?

Sorry, guys. Wait here for a little bit.

Here should be good.

Come to think of it, I forgot my manners.

Thanks for defeating Freeza for me.

Sure enough, I guess I went too easy on him.

You were actually supposed to be the one who defeated Freeza and the others, but there was some discrepancy, time-wise, and for whatever reason, you couldn't.

So I didn't have any other choice.

Yeah. Freeza's spaceship was faster, and he got ahead of me.

Looks like he ain't learned his lesson one bit, and when I was about to get him...

There were still three hours before your arrival, so you wouldn't have made it.

No, that ain't true. I picked up a new move.

A new move?

Yeah. it's something called instantaneous Movement.

I-Instantaneous Movement?

The folks on a planet called Yardrat taught it to me.

I could move from the spaceship I was in to where Freeza was in an instant.

I-Is that right?

Son-san, I didn't know that you had acquired that skill, so I thought that it would take you three hours to arrive by spaceship.

I've changed history for no reason.

As a result, I ran into everyone else when I only intended to see you, Son-san.

History? What do you mean?

Before I get into that, I have something to ask you.

Son-san, are you able to freely turn Super Saiyan at will?

Yeah. I couldn't do it at first, but I worked hard at it, and now I'm able to control it.

Would you turn here, now, for me?

If you please?

All right.

H-He turned Super Saiyan!

Is this okay?

Thank you very much.

I'm surprised. You look just like I do when I turn Super Saiyan.

So, now what do we do?

I will turn Super Saiyan, as well.

Damn it!

We really do look alike.

Please excuse me.

W-Why did you not move out of the way?

Because you had no bloodlust.
I knew you would stop short.

I see.

Well then, this time, I will not stop. Ready?

All right.

Impressive. The stories I've heard are true. No, you're even better.

This is the sword that I used to slice up Freeza.

That's just because you weren't trying very hard.

I am able to place my trust in you.

I will tell you everything.

D-Did you see that?

Yeah. Get a load of those guys!

Please keep everything I'm about to tell you locked away within your mind alone.

All right. Relax and speak freely. 
I'm the tight-lipped type.

I came here in a time machine, from roughly years in the future.

Th-The future?! Twenty years?!

Yes. My name is Trunks.

The reason why I carry Saiyan blood is because I am the son of Vegeta-san over there.

Y-You're really Vegeta's son?!

Now that you mention it, there is a resemblance.

He's your old man, huh?

I was born two years from now.

Wow, I'm stunned.

But I did not come here in the time machine to tell you that.

There is something very important that I would like you to know.

No-Okay.

In three years from this time, on May 8th, at about 10:00 a.m., on an island about kilos southwest of Metro South, a fearsome duo is going to appear.

They will be monsters, possessing powers unthinkable for anything of this world.

Who are they? Aliens?

No. They are Artificial Humans, born of this Earth--otherwise known as cyborgs.

The one who created them was a former mad scientist of the Red Ribbon Army, Doctor Gero.

Red Ribbon Army? You mean the Red Ribbon Army that I wiped out?

Correct.

The army itself was crushed by you, long ago.

However, Doctor Gero survived, and continued his research.

For what reason? Was the usual "world domination" his goal?

I don't really know for sure, but I think that's what Doctor Gero was after, at least.

But the Artificial Humans he created as the ultimate killing machines... ended up killing Doctor Gero, the one who gave them life.

Which is to say, the Artificial Humans, who delight in nothing but slaughter and destruction, were all that remained.

If you, the Super Saiyan who killed Freeza in the blink of an eye, call these things monsters, they must really be something.

Yes. I have faced off against them, but unfortunately, since there were two of them, even one-on-one, it was all I could do just to get away.

Hold on. if there's two of them, who else is on your side?

No one. 

20 years from now, I am the only warrior remaining.

In the battle three years from now, my father, Vegeta, Kuririn-san, Yamucha-san, Tenshinhan-san, Chaozu-san, Piccolo-san... all got killed.

Son Gohan-san barely escaped with his life.

Gohan-san was the teacher who taught me how to fight, until, four years ago...

As you are aware, with Piccolo-san dead, the Dragon Balls are gone, as well, and no one was able to come back to life.

They're too strong! They're just too strong!

Hold on! What about me?
What happened to me?

Did they get me, too?

You did not fight.

A short time from now, you will be stricken with an illness.

You will then die from it.

It is a viral heart disease.

Not even a Super Saiyan could beat out this illness.

What a bummer. Not even senzu beans work against this illness?

Damn, I'm gonna die, huh?

Aw, man, I want to fight these guys!

Do you really regret not being able to fight?

Have you no fear?

Sure I'm afraid.

These guys are crazy strong, right?
I wanna give them a shot!

You truly are a genuine Saiyan warrior.

Exactly the sort of man my mom and Gohan-san said you were.

When the symptoms appear, take this.

What is it?

Your medicine. it is an incurable disease in this era, but in years, there is a wonder drug for it.

With that medicine, you will be able to pull through.

Really? Hooray! Geez, why didn't you say so in the first place?!

The truth is, it's wrong for me to do this-- change history like this.

But given the history that it is...

I have faith that you will be able to do something.

That's all my mom hoped for, as well, as she worked so hard to finally complete the time machine.

H-Hold on a minute.

Sh-She made your time machine?
D-Don't tell me your mommy is...

Yes, right over there.

B-Bulma?!

How long are they going to gab?!
This is getting on my nerves!

It looks like Son-kun just fell over from surprise.

Wow, that's the most surprising thing of all!

I thought for sure that Bulma would settle down with Yamucha, but Vegeta, of all people...

Apparently, um, she got fed up with Yamucha-san two-timing her, and they broke up.

Oh, what's the matter?

When she did, she saw my father looking so lonesome, and apparently, it was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

But they never got married, my mom being the way she is, and all...

Wow, I had no idea.

Well, that does sound like her, now that you mention it.

My father died before I could remember him, so I was thrilled to meet him for the first time earlier.

It looks like he's looking over here.

It kind of looks like he's smiling. 

Um, please keep that part especially secret, okay?

If you say anything, and things get awkward between them, then my very existence will be wiped out.

Yeah, I got it, I got it!

Well, I will excuse myself now.

I'd like to hurry back and reassure my mom in the future.

Yeah. Tell her thanks a bunch for this!

I sure hope that future is changed.

Right. Knowing your strength, Goku-san, I now have a little hope.

Will I ever see you again?

I don't know. it takes a long time to obtain the energy required for the time machine to make a round trip.

If I'm still alive after that, I'll definitely come to help.

Three years from now.

You stay alive. You've got a good objective.

I'll train good and hard for these three years, with that in mind.

Hey, he's taking off!

Now then, what do I do?

I wonder how I'm gonna explain this to everyone.

Father!

Goku, what did he say?

Ah, er, well... it ain't anything that important.

Start talking. This is something very important for all of us.

Piccolo, you could hear us?

My sense of hearing is a little different from the rest of you.

What's so important?

Tell us.

Uh, w-well...

if it's too hard for you to do it, I'll tell them.

Y-Yeah, but...!

Don't worry. I won't say anything that would wipe out his existence.

But we shouldn't have to get killed because we didn't do any decent training.

Piccolo told the others everything, while managing to leave the mystery about Trunks intact.

As might be expected, no one was able to conceal their shock.

I-It kind of sounds far-fetched, doesn't it?

A time machine?

If you don't want to believe it, then fine. Go ahead and goof off.

I'm going to train. I don't want to die, after all.

W-What's that?

Dad, you are the strong, proud, stern, as well as lonesome, man that Mom said you were.

Please don't die.

Young Mom, you hang in there, too.

I-I'm going to train.

I will, too.

Damn it! I am definitely going to survive in three years!

After delivering the bombshell news, the mysterious youth departed.

Will there really be a fearsome pair that appears in three years?


New Technique of Goku, Instant Movement! Special Training Staked on 3 Years From Now" 

  



Kakarrot, tell us, how did you survive Planet Namek?

Come to think of it, that's right.

Freeza's spaceship was all busted up, right?

Kaio-sama said that there was no way you could make it.

I thought I was done for, too.

I thought I really was gonna die.

Damn it all!!

Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

But luckily for me, there were some of those ball-shaped spaceships nearby.

I get it!

The Ginyu Special Corps.
Those were the ships they came in.

Anyhow, I got into one of them, and started pushing buttons like mad.

I guess I must have caused a big stir.

It looks like I ain't in Heaven, anyway.

The Ginyu guys were going to attack Planet Yardrat.

The ships had been programmed to land there. That makes sense.

So those unusual clothes belong to the Yardratians?

Yeah. We got to be friends, and I got these from them.

The clothes ain't very stylish, but mine were all torn up.

Knowing you, I doubt you would have come back empty-handed after going all the way to Yardrat.

They don't have much power, but they do use some strange techniques.

You learned them, didn't you?

You guessed it!

I get it. So that's the reason why you didn't come back to Earth.

Okay, so, what kind of moves are they? Tell us!

I didn't have much time, so I only had them teach me one technique.

What's more, it was a real pain to learn.

I've gotten so I can perform instantaneous Movement.

Instantaneous Movement?

Y-You mean it, Son? Show us.

You want to see it? Okay.

With this, you don't visualize a place, but a person.

On top of that, you have to sense out their Ki.

So you can't go anyplace unless someone you know is there.

Let's see, where should I go?

All right.

Bye-bye!

He disappeared!

I'm back!

Hmph, instantaneous Movement my foot.

It's just high-speed smoke and mirrors.

Ta-da! What are these?

Th-Those are Muten Roshi-sama's sunglasses, aren't they?

Y-You're right!

Th-The Kame House is over 1,000 kilos away from here.

I-Incredible.

Told you it was for real.

Kuririn, give these back to the old-timer for me later.

Yeah, you got it.

You can do anything now, huh?

All right, then, let's all meet up in three years, on-site.

When and where should we go in three years?

Come to think of it, he did say so, huh? I forgot.

Three years from now, on May 8th, at 10:00 a.m., on an island kilos southwest of Metro South.

We can arrive at that island an hour earlier, at 9:00 am.

Thank goodness!

I-It's a good thing that Piccolo was listening in.

Let me just say, anyone who isn't sure about this, stay away.

These guys sound even more way out there than ever.

We won't be any match for them if anyone is slowing us down.

Y-Yeah, right. Stay away.

Don't make me laugh. You're the one who's least sure of himself.

What was that?! You want to try me?!

Now, now...

Say, I was just thinking a bit, but what if we were to find this Doctor Gero, who creates the Artificial Humans, and take him out now, while we can?

Even if we don't know where he is, if we use the Dragon Balls to ask Shen Long, I'm sure he'll tell us.

If we do that, there's no need to go through all that trouble in three years.

Hey, yeah! That's it, Bulma-ssn!

If we do that, we won't have to fight for sure.

Good going, Bulma-san! Way to go!

If you stick your nose in and do that, I will kill you! You got that?!

What do you mean, stick my nose in?! This isn't a game!

The fate of the Earth hangs in the balance!

Son-kun, you think so, too, don't you?

S-Sorry. To be honest, I wanna fight them, too.

Besides, this scientist ain't made anything yet, so taking him out is kinda...

G-Guys, there's no reason for us to take up with the Saiyans!

These guys are a race of fighting maniacs, after all.

If you die this time, there's no coming back to life again.

I'm fighting, too. I want to test what I'm capable of.

If I die, then I'll chalk it up as that being all that I am.

Oh, good grief...

B-Bulma-san, I've been thinking...

All of us here were once each other's enemies in the past, right?

I mean, at first, I hated Goku.

Whenever a powerful enemy appeared, we had no choice but to team up, and as such, before we knew it, we ended up as friends.

Ordinarily, it wouldn't turn out like this.

Everyone was so dreadful, after all.

What are you trying to say?

Without the objective of a common enemy, while Piccolo might be okay, we pretty much know what Vegeta is going to pull, don't we, missy?

Kuririn-san, you had such a nice speech going up to that point.

Shut up. Don't talk back.
What I'm saying is the truth.

Fine, I get it. Just do whatever you want.

God forbid that a fragile civilian such as myself gets caught up with you guys.

Let's fight for and win a peaceful future!

It's almost like you're some sketchy dictator from somewhere.

You're absolutely wrong about this. it's degenerate!

I've got no choice but to tag along with you for now, though.

Okay then, three years from now...

Let's see, at 10:00 a.m.
on May 8th, at that place...

And really, it's okay not to come, unless you're really sure of yourself.

Kakarrot!

Don't get too cocky just because you can turn Super Saiyan.

I swear I'm going to beat you to a pulp in due time.

Don't you forget that I'm the number-one Saiyan around here.

Yeah.

We're leaving, too. See you in three years.

Bye-bye.

Chaozu, come back crazy strong!

Tenshinhan-san, please come up with some amazing moves!

Piccolo.

Care to train with Gohan and me?

I'd like to spar with you and stuff.

Sounds good. I couldn't ask for more.

Yay! Yay!

Kuririn and Yamucha, you want to come with us, too?

I'm fine. I'll train with Muten Roshi-sama at my own pace.

I'll refrain, too.

To be honest, I doubt I could keep up with your training.

Okay.

Oh, right...

Bulma, have yourself a healthy baby.

Baby? Bulma-san, are you pregnant?

No, I'm not. I wonder what kind of nuttery that was.

Oh, no, what he's getting at is...why don't we get married already, and start a happy family?

Even he's starting to say it now.

And so, to prepare for a powerful foe that was to appear in three years, everyone went their separate ways.

Muten Roshi-sama...

Kuririn, it was a ghost!

Earlier, the ghost of Goku appeared and stole my glasses!

H-Huh? Why do you have my glasses?

I would like to train again... Huh?

Now I can rest at ease while looking at this.

U-Um, I was hoping to start training once again...

Muten Roshi-sama, my training...?

Huh? You want me to build you a 300G gravity room?

That's right.

Word is that Kakarrot trained in 100-times gravity.

This is only three times that.

That's crazy. Vegeta-kun, if your body weighs 60 kilos now, that would make it 18 tons.

That's out of the question.

Build it! I insist that you build it!

Gimme a break already!

You gotta be kiddin'!

Goku-sa, how much are you goin' to interfere with Gohan-chan before you're satisfied?!

I wanna have Gohan-chan study even more, so I bought him a set of learnin' materials and a sleep-study bed!

And now you wanna train him to get even stronger? Fat chance!

Goku-sa, you can just train with Piccolo on your own.

I told you, we're definitely going to need Gohan's help.

I understand about the studying, but three years from now, the whole Earth could be in real trouble.

Oh, come off it!

Goku-sa, you never do any work, and you never look after Gohan-chan!

Have you ever made even a single penny since we got married?!

W-When you put it like that, it does sound rough, but right now ain't the time for this.

Gohan is ready to fight, and all.

No way, no way! Ask all you want, I won't have it!

S-So then, you're saying that Gohan's studying is more important than the future of the Earth?

That's right! Of course it is!

I don't give a damn what else happens!

Gohan-chan's studyin' is what's most important!

What a kidder!

S-Sorry, Chichi! I've gone and gotten too strong!

I thought I was holding back!

I really am sorry. I can't believe I did this.

Okay, fine. it's always the woman who ends up in tears.

But once these three years are up, I'm pullin' the plug on your kung fu, no matter what.

Three years, no matter what.

So even Super Saiyans have weaknesses, huh?

And so began everyone's intensive training.

Ten-san, nicely done.

Here it comes, Gohan!

Right!

Not good enough!

I guess we can call it a day.

Yeah.

P-Please, let me go... a little longer...

I-I want to become stronger...

Like you are, Father, and Piccolo-san...

Keep it up, Yamucha-sama!

How could Vegeta suddenly start training at 300-times gravity?

I-I will surpass it...

I will go beyond even Super Saiyan... it's no surprise that this would happen.

Not with the dangerous training he's been doing.

Vegeta!

You're still alive?

No-Of course I am.

What are you doing?!

You almost ended up destroying my home, too, you know!

Vegeta!

M-Mind your own business...
You're interfering with my training...

Training, my eye. There's no way you can do that in your condition.

These injuries are nothing...

I am the greatest Saiyan in the universe...

I-I am going to surpass Kakarrot...

Right, right, vegetables and carrots and all the rest, but right now, you'll do as I say.

D-Don't you order me around...

Vegeta!

Coming away from that kind of accident with only this much damage is nothing short of miraculous.

These Saiyans are truly something else.

Poor Vegeta-chan.

Mother, let's leave them alone.

Okay.

K-Kakarrot...

I will surpass you...

I will surpass you... l swear it...!

Why?! Why can't I surpass them?!

Why?!

Oh, amazing!

Hey, Kuririn, these are amazing!

Hey, Kuririn, want to come over and look at these with me?

Masenko!!

There you are!

What's the matter, Gohan?
You're moving too slow!

Pu-erh, we're going on a training journey.

Right!

And so, in no time at all, three years went by.

Gohan-chan, Goku-sa, Piccolo-sa, you watch yourselves.

You're sure you don't want to take some lunches with you?

Th-Thanks anyway.

Thanks.

Okay, let's go!

Thanks to the Artificial Humans, the future that I come from is a hellish world.

They're too strong! They're just too strong!


The Pair Who Don't Leave a Trace! The Artificial Humans Appear"   




Hey, Gohan! We'll get there in time; You don't have to fly so hard.

You're gonna use up your strength before the fight!

Right.

Son Goku, how about it?

Do you honestly think we can win against this foe?

Ain't no way of knowing until I see them.

I'll give you an answer after we get started.

You're nice and laid-back, huh?

I'm sure that we can beat the Artificial Humans.

Still, I can't shake this bad feeling out of my head.

Bad feeling?

Piccolo, do us all a favor. if you get into any trouble, don't be a hero.

If you die, the Dragon Balls will be gone, too.

Father, look! it's Kuririn-san!

Kuririn-san!

H-Hey! You've gotten bigger, Gohan.

--Yo!
--Y-Yo...

What's wrong, Kuririn?

We ain't seen each other in all this time, but you seem bummed out.

How am I supposed to feel all festive when we're about to tangle with those monsters?

I'm not a Super Saiyan.

Nine kilos southwest of Metro South.

That's it! That's the island!

It's a pretty huge island, huh?

Yeah. This is bad. it's got a fairly large city on it, too, doesn't it?

We'll have to lure the Artificial Humans away from here, or the people on the island could become casualties of the fighting.

You're right.

I'm sensing two huge Ki coming from near that mountain.

That's probably Yamucha-san and the others.

All right, let's go.

It's them, all right.

It's Goku and the others. Hey!

Huh?

We've been waiting for you.
You guys are a little late.

--Bulma?!
--Bulma-san...

Yoo-hoo! My, you sure have gotten bigger, haven't you, Gohan-kun?

This ain't too bright.
What are you doing here, too?

I'm observing, of course.

It's okay. Once I get a look at the Artificial Humans, I'll leave.

I-I'm more surprised by the object you're carrying there, Bulma-san.

You and Yamucha-san have gotten married, then?

He's not my kid.

We've long since broken up.

You'll be stunned to hear whose kid he is.

Your daddy is Vegeta, huh, Trunks?

How do you know that?

I haven't contacted anyone, because I wanted it to be a surprise.

I-I-I just got that impression, sort of!

I mean, his face kind of resembles Vegeta, right?

You guessed his name right, too.

Really? Amazing! I-l wonder if I'm psychic!

Is he really Vegeta's child?

So, where is Vegeta, anyway?
I don't see him around.

I don't know. it's not like we're living together.

But I'm guessing he'll be here before long.

It looked like he was undergoing some incredible training to get ready for today.

Oh, he's coming. He'll definitely be coming.

I left Chaozu behind.
Frankly, he's not up to this fight.

Um, what time is it now?

Let's see, half past 9. They should appear in another 30 minutes.

Now's your chance. You should leave here.

Especially since you've brought a baby along.

I told you, I'll leave after I get a look at the Artificial Humans. 

30 minutes, huh?

Here, Kuririn-san, you give it a try.

Who, me?

Hmm, what kind of face should I make?

Uh, I haven't done anything yet.

Someone is headed this way.

It's nobody evil.

Huh? Could it be Vegeta-san?

Nah, he's evil.

Ah, over there, over there!

Yajirobe!

Whoo, guess I made it in time.

You came to fight, too?

These're from Karin-sama. They're senzu beans.

Wow, you saved the day!
That's Karin-sama for you!

Well, give 'em hell.

Hey, Yajirobe, you're fighting, ain't you?

Unlike the rest of you idiots, I'm not suicidal.

Like I'm gonna hang around with you!

Don't you think it's strange?

It's well past 10 o'clock now, and I don't sense any hint of the enemy.

Now that you mention it...

Maybe he really was pulling our leg.

I mean, Artificial Humans...

Still, he did say around o'clock.

It's only 10:15 , so it's too early to tell.

You have to admit, though, we're not sensing any strong Ki.

If these guys are that awful, we could tell where they are anywhere on Earth.

W-What was that?!

Ah! it's Yajirobe!

Look! There's something there!
That's what attacked him!

They've landed in the city!

Where did they go?!

Did you see, Goku?!

N-No. I couldn't tell who they were.

W-What's going on here?
I didn't sense any Ki at all.

I-It's because they're Artificial Humans. Th-They don't have Ki!

W-What?!

Damn...!

If we can't sense their Ki, we'll have to look for them directly, with our eyes.

All right, everyone split up and look for them!

Bulma, hang onto these for me!

Remember, don't get in over your heads.

If you spot them, let the rest of us know immediately.

Gohan, you see to Yajirobe.
He should still be alive.

Right!

Let's go!

shoot, who are they? Where did they go?

I should have asked Trunks to show me a photo of them, or something!

Damn it, where are they?!

H-He just flew here...!

It's not them... nor them...

Hey, have you seen anyone out of the ordinary?

Y-Yeah!

--What?
--Y-You!

Are you all right?

W-Who were those guys?!

Are those guys really even here?!

Hey, look! it fell into the sea!

Hey, did you guys see that?
A Skycar just blew up!

Did you see it?

W-What?

Hey, move out of the way!

I said, move out of the way!

You blasted fool! What are you doing in the middle of the street...?

A scream!

Somebody!

A human with an extremely high energy value is coming this way.

Is my search system malfunctioning?

It is no malfunction, No.20.
I am picking up the same energy.

But it far surpasses any human data.

We have already located... Son Goku.

I-It was around here.

W-Where are they? Where the hell are they?!

It was awful.

Hey, you there!

Who was it that did this to these guys?

--Did you see them?
--U-Um, it was an odd-looking pair.

Th-They were there just a moment ago, but they've vanished.

Th-They've vanished? Damn.

I-I guess I should call in the others.

No. it is not Son Goku.

He doesn't match our data.

There is a 87% probability that he is the human Yamucha.

In any case, we can obtain a great deal of energy.

Th-Then again, if they're not even here, there's no point in calling the others.

Do you guys know where the pair who committed these murders went?

Y-You mean...

We're the ones.

G-Guys!

W-What?!

M-My power...

There's a large Ki, dropping wildly! Who is it?

I-Is that Yamucha-san?!

They've shown themselves!

Yamucha!

You bastard!

Kuririn!

Yamucha is still alive!

I left the senzu beans back where we were before, so take him there and give him one!

A-All right.

We're counting on you, Kuririn.

Yeah.

So you're the Artificial Humans, are you?

At last, we get to see your faces.

That's curious. How did you know that we were Artificial Humans?

What's more, you apparently knew that we would appear on this island, as well.

Why is that? Answer me.

Who can say? Why don't you try to force the answers out of us?

That we will.

Wait! There will be too many casualties here.

Let's move to someplace uninhabited.

Is that okay with you guys?!

Someplace uninhabited? Very well.

But there's no reason to go to the trouble of relocating.

Stop that!!

W-What was that? What just happened?

I-It's them. They're the ones who did this.

H-How awful...

--Mommy!
--Look out!

Why, you...!

I thought I would make us a place that was uninhabited, but apparently, you don't seem to like it here.

Come with me! I'm gonna smash the both of you!

You will be unable to defeat us.

Very well. We will go with you.

You may choose where you would like to die, Son Goku.

Why do they know Goku's name?

We know who you are, too, Piccolo.
And Tenshinhan, isn't it?

We can ask questions later.

Let's go!

It's Father and the others!

Those guys are with them.

What?! Oh, they're changing locations.

Th-This is bad! I have to tell Goku and the others!

Those guys drain your power!


attacked on Both Sides by an Internal Enemy?! Son Goku vs Artificial Human #19" 



Yamucha-san, you say they drain power?

Yeah. I don't know what happened, exactly, but all they did was grab me, and my power disappeared in a hurry.

If that's true, then Doctor Gero has invented a terrible device.

Oh, no!

We have to hurry and go tell Father and the others!

To be honest, I don't want to go! I've had enough!

I came this close to dying, and I was powerless to stop them!

Gohan!

Yamucha-san, I'm going. I have to take the senzu beans to them.

None of you guys get how terrible these Artificial Humans are.

Damn it, I am not going there to fight!

I'm just going to observe!

Feh, dumb-ass.

Say, aren't you going, too?

Course I'm not goin'.

"Not goin" '? You're pretty strong, aren't you?

At a time like this, when our friends and the Earth are in peril, we need all the help we can get.

Darn tootin'.

"Darn tootin' "? Don't you even care?! You disgust me!

I dunno how to fly.

Oh, sorry.

That's good enough, Son Goku. 

How far do you plan on going?

Here will do! Make this the place!

You have no right to choose the location.

This is flat terrain, but it's surrounded by rocky hills.

They figure they can hide among the rocks and fight from there if they have to.

That's smart thinking on their part.

This is bad. They haven't started fighting, and are keeping their Ki suppressed.

We can't tell where they are like this.

Where are you?! Where are you?!

Now, before we start fighting, tell me, how do you know about us?

What's going on? Goku is out of breath.

And all we've done is fly here. Why?

Very well, I will tell you.

You'll probably wish you hadn't asked, though.

Son Goku, you have long been under surveillance by means of a microminiature insect spy robot.

At the Tenkaichi Budokai Tournament...as well as during your battles with Piccolo and Vegeta.

In other words, you have been continuously researched, even after the fall of the Red Ribbon Army.

To see what it would take to defeat Son Goku--what kind of Artificial Human could prevail against him.

This is a personal grudge against me?

That's right. Because of you, the Red Ribbon Army's dream of world conquest evaporated, and Doctor Gero was all that remained.

It almost sounds as though you yourself were Doctor Gero.

Don't be absurd. I am No.20, an Artificial Human, created by Doctor Gero.

Doctor Gero is dead, and no longer among us.

I see. But did you guys spy on the battle on Planet Namek, as well?

There was no need. We had a total grasp of your power and technique right up to your fight with Vegeta.

Even if you were to improve your skills any further, taking your age into consideration, we calculated that it would be impossible for any more large-scale power gains.

It sounds like you failed to investigate the most important thing.

--You guys are beat!
--What?

Not knowing about him being a Super Saiyan will prove fatal for you.

Super Saiyan?

This way!

I'm sensing an incredibly large Ki.

That's Father's Ki.

Yeah. But it's just the one.

Sure enough, I guess we can't sense Ki from the Artificial Humans.

What a Ki!

So this is how incredible it is up-close, is it?

Both of you, keep out of this.

I seem to be their primary target, after all.

Indeed, you seem to have powered yourself up remarkably.

No.20, that technique appears to be different from the Kaio-ken.

A curious technique.

It far exceeds the figures we had calculated.

However, it is not enough to rattle us.

It's still within the level where even No.19 could defeat you.

Is it, now? Then why don't you show me your strength, right now?

You've got him, Goku!

A-Amazing. What strength.
So that's a Super Saiyan.

It's like he's on a different plane than the rest of us.

Far different.

Perhaps...

He's powered himself up far more than our data predicted.

It's not possible.

This is bad! At this rate, No.19 is going to run out of energy before he can steal any.

Down there!

All right!

Father!

No need to worry. As a Super Saiyan, Goku is unbelievably strong.

A-Awesome! Goku is so strong!

You're right. Maybe I was mistaken about them draining energy.

Have you noticed it too, Gohan?

Yes.

Son Goku is rushing this fight for some reason.

He's already expending nearly his full power.

And yet, why is he making such a mess of things?!

Mess of things? What do you mean, a mess of things?

Goku is utterly overwhelming him.

He's better than that!

As a Super Saiyan, Goku should be much stronger than this!

U-Um, Yamucha-san was saying that the Artificial Humans are able to drain one's energy.
Could that be why?

What? Energy?

Yeah. He grabbed my face in his hand, and when he did, without doing anything else, it felt like my Ki was being rapidly sucked out of me.

Nice one!

--Did you get him? Nice one, Goku!
--All right! Way to go, Goku!

He's had it now!

Way to go!

Hey, look at that! As badly as he's getting beat, he's brushing it off like it's nothing!

He's an Artificial Human.

He probably doesn't feel pain or fatigue.

Damn it...!

Yes!

H-He absorbed it!

Th-That's it, all right! Through their hands!

Son! Don't shoot any Ki-wave blasts!

Apparently, they can absorb Ki through their hands!

Don't let them grab you, either! Got it?!

They take in Ki?

Y-You've gotta be kidding.

H-Hey, Goku looks out of sorts.

H-Has he already had that much Ki taken from him?

No, not once did he have any of it taken from him directly.

All right, that one raised No.19 's maximum power level dramatically.

On the other hand, Son Goku's energy has dropped significantly.

Now is your chance! Go!

Why, you...!

Don't shoot, Goku!

F-Father...

D-Damn it!

H-Hey, it looks like he's really having a hard time.

Are you sure he hasn't had his Ki sucked out of him?

That's it, all right! Father is sick! it's his heart!

What? His heart?!

You mean, the viral heart disease that guy from the future spoke of?!

That's impossible! Don't be ridiculous!

He got that wonder cure for the viral heart disease and cured it a long time ago!

Goku has just had his Ki drained by those guys!

Goku!

C-Can't breathe...
What's happening to my body...?

Goku! Here's a senzu! Eat it!

Th-Thank you...

J-Just what I need...

That's one of those senzu beans, which restore physical strength, and heal even serious injuries, is it?

Seeing as how he is here after very nearly dying, it would seem that they are real.

Th-The senzu didn't work!

It's the heart disease, all right!

But how?! He took the medicine and cured it, didn't he?!

H-He never got sick.

He's been healthy this whole time, so he never took the medicine.

Father!

Hey, he's no longer Super Saiyan!

What does this mean?!

Th-This is bad!
Goku's energy is being absorbed!

You will not be allowed to move one centimeter past this point.

Would you like to try?

Yes, I would.

Piccolo-san!

I can't call Piccolo's actions just now brave.

He was nothing more than a reckless fool.

He's fast. Too fast for us.

I-If we don't do something, Son will be...



No Chance of Victory Against #19! Super Vegeta Arrives Late"   

V-Vegeta...

Vegeta-san!

Vegeta...?

Piccolo-san!

And here, I even put on a cheap act, trying to create an opening to rescue Goku, but then, Vegeta, you had to interfere.

Piccolo-san! Then...

I don't care how strong he is, I won't be done in by a puny attack like that one.

I saw the whole thing. You went and turned Super Saiyan, even knowing that there was something amiss with your body.

Idiot! By doing that, it just made the disease kick into overdrive!

Kakarrot, my ultimate goal is to deal...with you!

Father!

Be strong, Father!

--Goku!
--Are you all right, Son?!

Hey, Goku, stay with us!

Somebody haul Kakarrot back to his house and administer that wonder drug he got back then.

Father!

I will take Father back home!

No, I'll go.

As pathetic as it sounds, I'm the one who can do the least amount of good here.

He said the heart disease was a viral one.

It might be contagious, so you should take some of the medicine, too.

Y-Yeah.

Please take care of him, Yamucha-san.

Now, hurry off!

Okay, guys, hang in there. 
I promise, I'll be back.

Goku, you get better!

No.19, you need not go after him.

There's something to be said for leaving the best for last.

Let's start by putting away these pesky insects.

Vegeta has now joined us, so this should be somewhat entertaining.

Upsie-upsie-upsie! Way-up-upsie!

Oh, sounds like he's wet himself again.

There, there...

Uh-oh. I didn't bring any extra diapers. What to do...?

What a pickle. Let's see, is there anything I can use instead...?

There, everything's okay.

You really came through for us.

You can always count on Yajirobe-kun, huh?

Hmph, see if I care.

Okay then, let's go.

W-Where to?

Oh, isn't that obvious?
I didn't come all this way just to go home without seeing the horrific Artificial Humans.

I-I ain't goin' there!

Ah, you wouldn't just stand there and let a delicate young lady and her sweet little baby go off to anyplace dangerous like that...

Now would he, Trunks-chan?

Now, hurry and get in.

We're just goin' to take a gander, 'kay?

Just take a gander, and then come right back, 'kay?

All right, just get inside already.

Blastoff!

Goku, it'll be fine. We'll all get those guys together.

We're going to change the future!

S-Say, Gohan, maybe it might be better to fall back for now.

What?

I mean, wouldn't it? Didn't that young man from the future say that Goku was taken out by illness, and that all of us, including even Vegeta, were done in by those Artificial Humans?

The circumstances may have changed, but right now, isn't that exactly what's happening?

But if we run away, those two are sure to go around turning the Earth upside down, like they did that city earlier.

I just mean until Goku gets over his illness.

We won't all necessarily be wiped out, like he said we would.

For one thing, Goku's illness was off by a fair amount of time.

Because of his arrival, history has probably changed in many subtle ways.

H-History has changed, he says?

That still doesn't change how terrifying these guys are, does it?

No.20...please allow me to dispose of Vegeta.

Hmph, greedy little pig.

You've already drained a good deal of Goku's energy, and raised your absolute power with it.

Well, all right. In exchange, I will take the remaining four.

Right.

Judging by the few moves I've already seen, I can tell that you guys are not as unbelievably tough as you've been made out to be.

All I have to watch out for are your palms, which apparently suck out energy.

You may have been watching all this time, but you failed to hear the most important part.

Vegeta, I know all of your combat skills.

You had a pretty surprised look on your face when Kakarrot went Super Saiyan, considering.

Which means that all of your data from before the battle with Freeza up until now has been suppositional.

You can't figure the power that we Saiyans possess by mere calculation.

I'm curious as to whether or not you Artificial Humans tremble with fear.

What?!

Him, too?!

V-Vegeta-san can turn Super Saiyan, too!

Th-That's impossible!
How can he turn Super Saiyan?!

I thought you couldn't turn Super Saiyan if you didn't have a serene heart!

Oh, it was serene.

Serene and pure.

However, it was pure evil.

I single-mindedly desired to become stronger, and put myself through tremendous training.

D-Damn it!

At some point, I realized what my limits were.

I-I'll never be able to surpass Kakarrot like this!

And then, over the anger I felt toward myself, it suddenly awoke...

The Super Saiyan that was within me!

I trembled with joy.

The time when I would surpass Kakarrot, and retake my place as prince of the Saiyans had come.

That's enough of your blather.

I don't care what you've turned into, you're still no match for us Artificial Humans.

Just as with Son Goku earlier.

Hmph, yeah, I figured as much.

Didn't I mention? When I turn Super Saiyan, my ferocity increases somewhat.

I enter a slightly excited state, you see.

You don't feel pain, right? Lucky for you.

H-He's strong!

What's the matter? Were you junkyard dummies' calculations off?

You're well put together, aren't you?

Is that blood? Or is it oil?

I've caught you!

I won't let go until I've drained all of your energy!

Oh, no!

Kicking me won't do any good.
I won't let go, no matter what!

No matter what, you say?

Don't you let go.

Indeed, so you really do suck out energy through your hands.

What's more, you appear to add that energy to your own.

No way I'm letting go...!

Don't let go, no matter what.
No matter what, now!

I see, so this is the place on your palm where you suck out energy, is it?

You've drained quite a bit from me, but you can't do that anymore now, huh?

You feel fear, do you?
Despite being an Artificial Human?

Why, you...!

Don't be so hasty! After I take care of him,

I'll take you on, nice and slow!

W-What's that?

Take this! This is Super Vegeta's Big Bang Attack!

Huh? What's that smoke?

I know!

That's the island where everyone is fighting the Artificial Humans!

Hey! Don't tell me yer thinkin' of goin' to that island!

Of course I am. isn't that obvious?

Knock it off, ya idiot!

What are you doing?!

--Cut it out! Go back! Go back!
--Hey, just a minute, now!

It's true, this wasn't in our calculations.

But, as before, you have absolutely no possibility of achieving victory.

He drained quite a bit of energy from me.

If you're going to defeat me, now is your chance.

Come and get me.

Does he have some sort of strategy?

You were just going on about us having absolutely no chance of achieving victory.

I don't buy it myself, but how do you mean?

No matter how unimaginably strong you might be, it will take more than that to beat the Artificial Humans.

Sure enough, you're simply being a poor loser.

H-He's running away!
He's planning to hide in the hills!

Hey, Kuririn, give me one of those senzu beans!

B-But...

Do it now! Do you want to just let him get away?!

Do it, Kuririn.

All right.

Here!

We don't have all day, you morons.

All right!

You guys go on home and enjoy a nice glass of milk or something, so long as you stay out of my way!

Damn it! Like hell I'm gonna go drink milk!

He really did lose quite a bit of his strength, in order to draw the fight out on purpose, and confirm that the Artificial Humans drain energy with their palms.

If he had fought that No.20 guy just then, he would have lost.

Moreover, there was something else behind what that guy said.

Vegeta really is a gifted fighter.

He may have even surpassed Goku.

In any event, I'm going!

I want to confirm with my own eyes the end of the Artificial Humans!

M-Me, too.

I'm going, too.

As it stands, I don't know why I did all that training.

All right. But don't try to fight.

He's not the sort of opponent you guys can handle!

He will be hiding himself somewhere in those rocky hills.

He's an Artificial Human, so you can't rely on sensing his presence to locate him.

If you find him, inform either Vegeta or myself at once.

--Yeah.
--Make sure to remain alert.

--Right!
--Yeah.

Let's go!


Piccolo's assault! The Missing #20 and the Future Gone Askew" 
  


Where are you?! Come on out, you coward!

Show yourself!

Damn it, he really is going to use the terrain here.

In that case, I'll just have to drive him out!

I'll just blow all of these rocky hills away!

N-No, don't! We're down here, too!

Take this!

That energy is now mine!

Aw, crap!

Damn it!

Damn it, that guy is faster than I thought!

It looks like he's too accustomed to sensing an opponent's Ki to know what their movements are.

I can tell your actions quite well, but you can't find me.

Though I have to admit, I never thought Vegeta would be so strong.

What should I do? He's well on guard.

I guess I have no choice but to return to the laboratory.

I would have liked to avoid the laboratory, if at all possible.

He's here, too!

This place is crawling with folks I can steal energy from.

If I drain all of their energy, and add it to my own, I can beat Vegeta!

Oh, it's just you. Don't scare me like that.

Damn, it sure is eerie not being able to see your enemy.

Damn, where did he vanish to, really?

If I'd known this, I would have gone home and drank some milk, like Vegeta said.

Now then, whose energy shall I take first...?

That would have to be Piccolo, the next strongest one after Vegeta.

At Piccolo's level, I can do anything I want to him.

Just you wait, Vegeta!

Damn...

He may have already gotten away.

No one can see us. I know exactly where everyone else is.

Now then, to take your energy...!

G-Gohan! Come over here, right away!

Th-The Artificial Human is...

Piccolo-san?

W-Where are you?!

I'm sensing a faint Ki in turmoil! That way!

You only have a little energy remaining!

I'll keep this up until you're dead!

Y-You saved me, Gohan.

H-How?

There's no way he could have found us.

You junkyard dummy...

I still can't beat Vegeta with only this much energy.

I'll have to steal more energy from the others.

Kuririn-san, give Piccolo-san a senzu!

No-Okay! Here!

Piccolo-san!

Let me have him, Vegeta!

Don't you dare step in here!

It's up to you if you want to die.

Are you sure you're not just going to provide him with more energy?

Don't step in, he says?

Good. I'll drain some more of his energy.

And once I do, Vegeta will be...

This isn't supposed to happen.

I just had my guard down that time.

I-Impossible...!

There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to defeat him.

For one thing, I've added all his energy to myself.

I should at least have as much, if not more power than he does.

I-It looks like I'm late, after all.

Neither Goku-san and the others nor the Artificial Humans are here.

The island is a mess. What on earth happened?

I'd like to go back a little earlier with the time machine, but I've barely got enough energy to go home now.

What's more, the machine isn't perfect, so I could be off again.

A Ki! I sense a Ki in battle.

That's it! They're fighting in a different location!

That must be it. They're where that explosion was earlier.

We don't hafta go all the way there. Let's head back home.

We can just let Goku and them handle this.

We've got the kid here and all.

Did you see that?!

It's the boy who came from the future!

Now lookit! Ya had to go and shout, and now ya woke him up!

He's going to fight, too!
This is the right direction, all right!

All right, let's go!

Over there!

Piccolo-san, you're amazing!

H-He's strong! What kind of training did Piccolo go through?

A-And he's not even a Super Saiyan, either.

W-Why, you...

Behind you!

Piccolo-san!

Something to keep in mind-- when we fight, we can amplify what you would call our energy into huge bursts.

Which is the reason why the energy you stole from me was nothing to fret over.

He's won!

Sure enough, what that man from the future told us was wrong!

W-What kind of Artificial Human is this?

Just what are the others fighting against?

Impossible... What's going on?

The fight is still going on!

That one was not like the Artificial Humans that I know.

What does this mean?
Are there three Artificial Humans?

Confound it... To think that even Piccolo has increased his power this much...!

Apparently, in the original history, we were supposed to be wiped out by two Artificial Humans, but it would seem that history has been changed.

Are you not as strong as we thought you were? Or, instead...is it that we've just become too strong for you?

Hey, we've done it! We're going to take them down, even without Goku!

Right!

I'm not too thrilled with Piccolo and Vegeta abnormally powering up like that, but for the time being, we can rest at ease.

Piccolo, hurry up and put him away.

Or would you rather I do it for you?

Heh, no thanks.

I am, after all, the detached embodiment of Kami's evil.

I'm not as soft as Goku is!

W-Who's that?!

I-It's...!

Trunks!

What? Trunks? Did he say Trunks?

Th-That's the same name that my kid has. The same name!

He came from the future...

So that's it!

H-He's different, too!

A-A new one just showed up.
Who is he? He's not in my data.

Whatever the case, this has been an outrageous miscalculation on my part.

I have no choice but to go back...to the laboratory.

W-Who is that guy?
Y-You were fighting him, right?

What?

Who is he? He's the Artificial Human you told us about!

What's going on here?

Y-You mean, he's not?

W-What? it's not him?

Y-You mean...?

W-Who was it that done gouged up the earth here?

Look, over there, over there!
That's where everyone is!

That's them! That's Son-kun and the others, right?

N-No way, ya idiot! Are you really thinkin' of goin' there?!

It will be all right. Seeing as how everyone is still alive, I'm sure it's all over now.

Take us any closer, and I'll chuck this kid right outta here!

Oh? Go ahead. Didn't I mention?
His father is Vegeta.

V-Vegeta?

This kid-- I mean, this fine lad is you and Vegeta-sama's child?

--L-Let's go.
--Right!

Not them? Not them, you say?!

Then, what is that?! What do you call that?!

I-It's not that big a deal, is it?

I mean, history has changed a bit from what he told us about, right?

So the Artificial Humans have also changed a bit from the ones he knows.

I hope you're right.

Now then, what do I do?
How do I get to the laboratory?

If I fly there, they're likely to just catch up to me.

I-I guess I'll have to use the terrain to hide, and go on foot.

H-Hey, isn't that Bulma-san's?

Yoo-hoo!

Hey, look there! it's him!

The Artificial Human's still there, ain't he?!

Doctor Gero...?

I-It's too dangerous! Keep back!

Now!

It's true what I said about you having absolutely no chance of winning!

No.17 and No.18 will be coming to kill you in no time!

--No.17 ?
--No.18 ?


Pursue! Doctor Gero... The Search for the Mysterious Laboratory!"   


Th-That bastard!

Holy smokes! Huh? Trunks?!

T-Trunks?! Oh, Trunks!

Ah, thank goodness.

Thank you.

He vanished. Damn!

He got away!

--Bulma-san!
--Are you all right?

I'm fine, I'm fine! He saved me.

--Thank goodness.
--Yes, indeed.

Damn it, there's no way I'm letting him get away!

Why didn't you do anything to help them just now?!

--What?
--They're your wife and son, aren't they?!

Hmph, what rubbish. I have no interest in any of that.

Move it, you're in my way!

He didn't fly away from here.

He's running along the ground to keep us from spotting him.

He couldn't have gotten too far, though.

S-Say, was that weird-looking old geezer an Artificial Human?

There, there...

Y-Yes, he was.

There, there, there, there...

That was probably Doctor Gero himself.

I've seen him in science magazines.

That's strange, huh? I wonder if he converted himself.

Ah, there, there...

Hey! That Artificial Human just now was Doctor Gero!

Doctor Gero?!

You say that was Doctor Gero?!

What exactly do you mean?!

Like I said, I've seen the man's picture.

He told us it would be Doctor Gero, so I looked him up.

Ah, there, there...

Pretty stern-faced, huh?

You know, Doctor Gero was apparently a fairly well-known genius among other scientists.

Not a very agreeable one, though.

Ah, there, there, there, there...

Everything you've told us has been a load of crap!

I thought Doctor Gero was supposed to have been killed by his Artificial Humans!

The Artificial Humans were also different!

I-I can only guess that history itself has gotten out of whack.

Probably by my coming into the past earlier.

He mentioned No.17 and No.18.

Those are probably the Artificial Humans you told us about.

Tell us what their features are.

We can't afford any more mistakes.

Yes, you're right.

No.17 is a young man with long black hair and a scarf around his neck.

No.18 is a cute girl type whose clothes are similar to my own.

A-A girl type, you say?

They both have cold eyes and round earrings, so you should recognize them if you look closely.

Do they absorb energy through their hands, as well?

N-No, they're not like that.

Their energy is unlimited.

Unlimited? You mean, it never runs out?

B-But never mind them, where is Son Goku-san?

That heart disease that you told us about...He just barely came down with it.

S-So that's how out-of-sync time has become?

Goku!

Here's your medicine!

Goku-sa, hang in there!

Goku-sa!

Bulma, do you know where Doctor Gero's laboratory is?

He's sure to go back to it.

Let's see, as I recall, I think it was in the mountains near Metro North.

There were rumors that he converted a cave into a laboratory.

He's long gone by now. if we were to go after him at this point...

Not to worry. Did anyone see him flying away?

N-Now that you mention it...

He's planning to use the terrain to hide himself as he flees.

He's sure to still be running around here somewhere.

I get you. You're saying we should get there ahead of Doctor Gero and destroy No.17 and No.18 before he can awaken them.

I wouldn't do anything so cowardly!

I just want to be the first one there to deal with them!

That previous Artificial Human made for a lousy fight!

You mustn't!

You mustn't. You underestimate the Artificial Humans.

We should destroy them before they are activated, as Piccolo-san said!

I-If we don't make it in time to do that, we should avoid any fighting until Son Goku-san gets over his illness!

There's no need to wait for Kakarrot!

Can't you see? I have become a Super Saiyan, too.

Both of us being Super Saiyan, I, as an elite, am obviously significantly stronger!

Now get out of my way!

Hey, he left.

Vegeta has become a Super Saiyan, and has acquired enough strength to surpass Son Goku.

We may be able to deal with the Artificial Humans, like he says.

I can turn Super Saiyan, as well.

But I was in no way a match for them.
Their strength is monstrous.

I'm going, too. He may be a jerk, but I am not going to let my father die again!

His father? Did he say his father?

I wonder what he means.

There's no sense in keeping it a secret anymore.

His name is Trunks. His father is Vegeta, and you are his mother.

In other words, he's the grown-up version of that baby.

Y-You're kidding!

I-Is that right?

N-Now that you mention it, they look alike!

I-I-I finally get it. That's how he was able to turn Super Saiyan!

Trunks, you're going to become a fine young man, aren't you?

That's terrific!

With that naughty look in your eye, your mother was worried!

Kuririn. Tenshinhan.

Come with me and help look for Doctor Gero's laboratory.

It sounds like we'd be better off destroying the Artificial Humans before they're activated.

--Yeah, okay.
--Right.

What am I, a bug?

B-Bulma-san, please tell Father about this, and that if he recovers in time, we want him to join us.

Sure, but how am I going to tell him? My airplane is busted.

Gohan, you take her back.

If all we're doing is destroying the Artificial Humans, we'll be fine without you.

Okay, but be careful.

All right, let's go! Let's be sure to find it before Vegeta does!

--Yeah!
--Yeah!

Okay, we're going to rush back now.

Be careful. I've got the baby, too.

Hey, you forget 'bout me?

Hurry it up! Hurry!

This should be far enough.

If I start flying from here, I doubt they'll spot me.

Vegeta!

Damn, is he still out looking for me? He's relentless!

H-Him, too! The two of them are flying the exact same direction that I'm going.

They couldn't be headed toward my laboratory.

No, it's just a coincidence.

It has to be a coincidence.

There's no way they could know where the laboratory is located.

Only a very few scientists know of it.

That was Bulma! Daughter of the head of the Capsule Corporation!

She may have asked her father about me.

That's it, all right! They're headed for my laboratory!

So that's it. They're planning to destroy No.17 and No.18 before I can start them up.

There's no way I'll let that happen!

I never told anyone its precise location, so they can look all they want, but they won't find it.

I can take the long way and still get there first!

Listen, it's okay to go a little faster.

Right...

Yajirobe! You can walk from here!

--Put a sock in it!
--What do you mean, put a sock in it?!

Your late father?

He did do a lot of bad stuff, to be sure.

He's in hell right now, no doubt about it.

But he had his good points, too.
He had a lot of pride, though, and wasn't the sort of man who showed kindness openly, but I knew.

Are you planning to tag along the whole way?

This should be good.

That's right, he can turn Super Saiyan, too, can't he?

He's my kid, so it's no wonder that he has inherited Saiyan blood.

Are we getting close to Metro North yet?

It should be just up ahead.

I see it!

What about Vegeta?

We have to find the laboratory before Vegeta does, or we're gonna have a real problem.

What a selfish, obstinate know-nothing. I have to stop this foolishness, no matter what it takes, until Goku-san comes back.

I am the prince of Saiyans.

I will not be lumped together with that low-class warrior Kakarrot!

I am a Super Saiyan among Super Saiyans!

I'm going to scrap No.17, No.18, and anyone else!

It's too late!

You are all going to die!

I ain't ever seen this one before.
Not this strange one.

Goku-sa! Goku-sa!

Goku-sa! Goku-sa...!

Goku! Keep it together, Goku!

Goku-sa, it's goin' to be okay.
Shake it off, Goku-sa.

He must be havin' an awful frightenin' dream.

The medicine couldn't have been too late for him, could it?

Gohan, ain't we gotten to yer house yet? I'm gettin' tired here.

What are you talking about?

You're just lying there, having your fat fanny carried for you!

How can you say that?!

I-I don't mind.

Yajirobe, did you hear that?

Isn't he admirable?

Trunks, you grow up to be like your big brother Gohan.

He'll be fine. We just saw how nifty Trunks-san is, didn't we?

You're right. He was pretty cool, wasn't he?

You sure we can believe him?

What was that?

That's a rude thing to say about my son, you know!

Bulma-san!

You say you're sorry, Yajirobe!

Sure, he's yer kid all right, Bulma, but he's also Vegeta's kid, and all.

So what?!

Let's tell Vegeta he said so, okay?

Forget I said anythin'! 'Kay, Bulma-sama?!

Trunks-san is a good person.

He came all the way from the future to tell us of this danger.

Right you are. That's our Gohan-kun for you!

Still, he's got that wicked look in his eye.

And that's just what we'll tell your father, Trunks.

Please don't do that, Bulma-sama!

If Trunks-san hadn't told us ahead of time, we wouldn't have known about Father's illness, the Artificial Humans, or anything.

He even prepared that medicine for him.

He really is a bright, considerate boy.

I sure hope that Father has taken that medicine and gotten better.

I'm sure he's gotten better.

Yes, you're right. I'm going to speed up now.

J-J-Just a second, here!

Doctor Gero's laboratory is supposed to be in a cave in one of the mountains around here, right?

It sure is cold here in the north.

How do we find it? There are mountains everywhere around here.

What's more, he can sense our Ki, but we can't sense any Ki from him.

We've got no choice but to split up and search.

If you find anything, signal the others before anything else.

So, what should the signal be?

Raise your Ki sharply.
We'll be able to tell right away.

Good thinking.

Sure is cold! I need a parka!

Toughen up. I'm cold, too, you know.

You earthlings are at a disadvantage.

Now let's hurry, before No.17 and No.18 are started up.

All right, let's split up and search.

Our future as earthlings is at stake!

Just a moment!

Why, so you can say how cold it is again?

No! I was just thinking I should share the senzu beans with you.

Yeah, those will come in handy.

There's exactly six of them remaining.

Since there's three of us, that's two apiece, right?

I'd like to be able to finish this without having to use these.

They're here, all right. But they won't find my laboratory so easily.

Go ahead and hang around here. I'll kill you soon enough!

How long are you planning to tag along and keep an eye on me?

Get lost already! You're bothering me!

I can't do that! You want to fight the Artificial Humans, right?

What are you going to do once I find the laboratory?

Are you going to destroy the Artificial Humans, even if it means fighting me?

It will probably come to that.

I'll say it again--you underestimate the strength of No.17 and No.18.

Hmph. A pure Saiyan would want to fight them even more after being told that.

Though I have to ask, where exactly is Doctor Gero's laboratory?

You don't understand anything!

Kuririn?

You annoying insect! At your level of energy, you're absolutely no help at all.

Damn it, look down on me, will you?!

I'll crush you right now instead!

Piccolo?

There's no need for me to sully my hands personally.

You'll get to live for a little while longer. You should be grateful.

It's only a matter of time now.

I-I have to tell the others...

No, I have to find the laboratory first.


#17 and #18, and...! The Artificial Humans Awaken"   


S-So, you're awake, No. 17.

Good morning, Doctor Gero-sama.

Hoho, a greeting, for me?

Of course. You are my creator, after all.

Sounds like he's recovered nicely.

Now for No. 18.

Good morning, Doctor Gero-sama.

Ho, a greeting from you, as well?

It's only natural.

They've both recovered nicely.

I see you have become an Artificial Human, as well.

Mm-hmm. I wanted eternal life, you see.

To be honest, this is a relief.

As a result of over-gearing most of your functions to work with the enormous power of your perpetual energy reactors, you were unable to maintain control, and up to now, you did not obey my orders.

This time, you are going to obey my orders.

Now then, I'm going to put you to work right away.

In a short time, Son Goku's friends will be coming here.

Deal with every last one of them. Understood?

--Yes.
--Very well.

That's Doctor Gero's laboratory.

Kuririn, way to find it.

Y-Yeah...

You've outdone yourself. Let's dispose of them before he comes back.

All right!

Hold on a second!

What is it, Kuririn?

D-Doctor Gero already came back.

What?!

S-Sorry.

You should have said so!
What if we're too late?!

They're here. The fools know no fear.

Okay, you two are up.

This door sure is sturdy!

Stand aside. I'll destroy it.

Nicely found.

Drop the hammer on them!

No. ! W-What are you doing?!

This is a controller used to execute an emergency shutdown on us, right?

Just in case you might have to.

We have no use for this.

W-What do you think you're doing?! Is this a joke?!

I'm not letting you put me to sleep again, you old geezer.

If you destroy the Artificial Humans, you'll pay for it.

You mustn't!

You don't know the true terror of the Artificial Humans!

Silence!

No.17, cut out this ridiculous prank, and take care of the enemies outside the door!

Th-The Artificial Humans are already activated!

Get out of the way, dumb-ass!

You mustn't! We should get out of here!

Please wait until Son Goku-san has recovered! After that...

Not necessary!

A young man with a scarf around his neck, and long black hair...

That's No.17, is it?

And No.18 ... is a cute girl type...

Trunks, they're just as you described, no two ways about it, right?

Y-Yes.

Th-Those two are No.17 and No.18?

You must not be thrown off guard by their outward appearance.

They truly are quite fearsome!

Those are Son Goku's friends, the ones I mentioned earlier.

Don't take them too lightly.

They destroyed No.19 , and nearly killed me as well.

No.19 ?

You made one of those, as well?

Y-Yeah.

I see. So you had that one convert you into an Artificial Human, old man?

Energy-absorption type?

Th-That's right.

Why did you go back to the old energy-absorption type for a newer model?

Could it be because the perpetual type had too much power, and you couldn't keep them under control?

--Yeah.
--Well, that's why you were beaten.

Couldn't keep them under control?

None of that matters! Would you hurry up and take care of them?!

Quit your yammering.

We'll fight them when we want to.

W-What did you say?!

Damn it...!

If only I had my controller...!

No.16, huh?

This is another perpetual type, right?

But it's a variety unlike us, isn't it?

It's a bit on the large side, for one thing. I wonder what's different.

Don't touch that, No.18 ! Don't you touch it!

Don't touch it!

N-No.16 ?! I don't know that one!
What's going on here?

Sounds interesting, doesn't it?
Try starting it up, No.18.

No! Stop!

Do you want to destroy the world itself?!

What?!

Destroy the world itself...?

What does he mean?

Hey, maybe we should get out of here while they're bickering with each other.

Go ahead and do that.

After all, they're beyond everyone here besides me.

No.16 is an experimental, failed model!

Do not activate him under any circumstances!

Don't do it!

Don't touch that!

I don't appreciate you touching a lady so presumptuously!

For being a flop, you sure have kept him around a long time.

It appears you've disposed of everything up to No.15.

I was planning to rebuild him in time.

In any event, do not activate him!

You could be signing a death warrant for both you and me!

She could be signing our death warrants?

Even though, according to the data, my power is greater?

That's correct.

Who cares? Start him up, No.18.

Stop countering me at every turn!
You two are the same as No.16!

You're failed models! Just try it!

I'll turn you off for good!

We broke your controller unit.

I'll just make a new one!

Didn't you hear a thing I said?!
Don't push that button!

N-No.17 ... why, you...!

What are you doing?!
I'm the one who created you--

Why, you miserable piece of junk...

What a monster! He killed his own creator!

They kill anyone they don't like, no matter who they are, huh?

Just like the Saiyans.

Me?

Why only me...?

Well, push the button.

I won't allow that to happen!

I am not about to let there be any more Artificial Humans!

You dumb-ass!

If you're gonna do that, tell us first, okay?!

You dumb-ass, that was a worthless thing to do.

A worthless thing to do?!

Look over there.

That level of attack was nothing more than a waste of energy.

This is why I find kids to be so asinine.

We'd better open it up quickly.
The pipes and cords have been cut.

Th-They've opened it! Does this mean there's yet another one?

That's No. ... This is bad.
He looks awfully strong.

I don't know him. I've never even seen him.

Yo, No.16, this is the first time I've seen you active.

How does it feel being outside after all these years?

Doctor Gero was against starting you up.

He said we could be signing our own death warrant.

We'd like to know what he meant by that. Any thoughts?

You'd rather not say?

Or is it just that you don't talk much?

Well, whatever. Shall we be off?

Where to?

Isn't that obvious? Wherever Son Goku is.

You were originally created to kill Son Goku, too, right?

--That's right.
--Well, well.

He's finally opened his mouth for us.

You only respond according to the input Doctor Gero gave you.

It was rude of him to call you a failed model.

I hate to actually follow one of Doctor Gero's orders, but we Artificial Humans do need an objective for the time being.

All right, let's be off.

Th-They left.

Thank goodness!

W-What are they planning to do? Where are they going?

It doesn't look like they're going to run riot through Metro North.

That's the other direction.

It's Goku! Could they be going to Goku's house?!

Remember? Doctor Gero's goal was to get Goku for bringing down the Red Ribbon Army, right?

B-But I doubt they'd follow any of Doctor Gero's orders.

None of it matters.

Not while I'm here.

They ignored me. Are they saying I'm beneath their notice?

Mess with me, will they?!

You can't go after them!

Please wait... Please wait a little longer!

What, until Kakarrot recovers from his illness?

Kakarrot? You mean, Goku-san?
Yes! We'll need Goku-san's help, with all of us fighting together, or there's no way we'll beat them!

You've got it all wrong.

It's not the Artificial Humans that I dislike most of all--

it's Kakarrot!

I will put them all away myself, without any of his help.

And then, last of all, I'll put Kakarrot away, too.

Now get out of my way!

That's crazy! You're as good as running off to your own death!

Please wait just a little while longer!

H-Hey...!

Are you okay?

G-Go after him!

We can't let him go off on his own until Goku-san has recovered!

Please stop him!

Gohan and Bulma-san are headed to his house.

They'll overtake them in no time!

Oh, no...

My mom and the others are in danger!

Go after them!

Fer criminy's sake, usin' my scarf as a diaper...He's peed all over it!

This thing reeks.

Yajirobe, do you have anything else I can use as a diaper?

Like I'd give you anythin' else!

Trunks-chan is going to catch cold, you know!

Relax, he's already grown up big and strong, ain't he?

Oh, I suppose he has.

Trunks-chan, you can get through this, right?

There you go, upsie-upsie!
Upsie-upsie! Upsie-upsie!

Bulma-san...if it's okay with you, I'd like to hurry along.

You bet. I'm sure you must be worried about Son-kun's condition.

Let's go.

I wonder if Father is better yet.

It looks like he's resting a lot easier now.

Really?

Yeah. Oh, right. Apparently, it's some sort of viral illness, so I'll take some, too. Chichi-san, you should take some, as well.

By the way, what is Gohan-chan up to?

Huh? He hasn't come back yet, has he?

I-I'll bet he's off playing somewhere.

Curse him! Who cares about Kakarrot?!

I have become a Super Saiyan, too.

Under identical circumstances, I, Vegeta, the Saiyan prince, far outpace that guy!
I'll show them my true power!

No.17 , why are we landing?

Let's enjoy ourselves along the way.

There's no sense in hurrying there.

Are we walking, then?

Let's go by car.

There should be a car passing by here before long, so we'll take that.

You boys like pointless stuff like this, huh?

You've still got some of your humanity left, don't you?

You're with me, right, No.16 ?

You're also an Artificial Human who was made from a human male.

No. I was created from nothing.

You're not human-based?

You're fundamentally different from us.

That's strange.
If Doctor Gero had the technology to create an Artificial Human from scratch, why did he go back to using human-based types again?

Yo!

I wouldn't have expected to find you again, hanging around in a place like this.

Huh? There's a different air about you than there was before.

It's not just my air that's different.

I'd like to ask you where you guys are planning to go.

We're going to where Son Goku is, to kill him.

That's what I thought. You won't be able to get there, though.

That's because I'm going to dispose of you.

Is that funny?

Go ahead and laugh it up now, while you can.

Saiyans certainly are overconfident, huh?

Apparently, Son Goku is the same way. 
The more mediocre they are, the sooner they die, thanks to their pride.

You've got a big mouth for a rag doll!

I'll rip you to pieces! Who's first?!

The kid? The girl? The love you?!

Or do you want me to take out all three of you at once?!

You're pushing it.

What did you say?!

No.16, I want to see how strong you are. Let him have it.

I'll pass.

It sounds like he gets it.

How powerful I am, I mean.

He's a strange one. Says he'll take a pass.

You've bitten off more than you can chew.

Fine. I'll take you on.

I'm telling you right now, I'm not holding back on you just because you're a girl.

But then again, you're an Artificial Human, not a girl.


A Cute Face and Super Power?! #18 vs Vegeta"   


Go to my home first.

B-But there are things I need to tell Father right away.

You have no idea how it feels to be a "Young Missus.

" You're just like your father in that way.

You're the type who's going to have a hard time with women later on.

It's a real struggle being a young mother.

There's so much I have to do for Trunks, like change him and prepare his milk and so on.

She's right.

There'll be more, better chow there too.

Head to Bulma's.

W- well, okay then.

We'll go to Bulma-san's home.

Goku-sa seems to be feelin' better.

Come to think of it, what's Gohan-chan doin' now? I sure hope the Androids haven't overtaken Gohan and Bulma-san.

Dad Here! Surprising.

He's got a much greater strength than in the information Doctor Gero provided us.

Vegeta, huh? Not too bad.

There's no way I can tell if you wind-up mannequins suffer damage or not.

As such, I'll just have to blow you to pieces.

Enough so that you'll never smile again.

Hey, you numbskulls! What do you think you're doing in the middle of the road? Blithering halfwits! If you don't get out of the way, I'll run right over top of you! Just keep smiling, while you're still able.

Hey, didn't you hear me! Go ahead, try it.

Hey! It looks as though you're faster than I thought.

You haven't been giving me your all, have you? Of course not.

If I gave it my all, it would destroy the earth.

I haven't been giving it my all, either.

Could you tell? In that case, don't hold back.

You'd better give me your best while you can, or you'll regret it later.

Well then, I will.

Are you all right, Vegeta-san!? Vegeta-san! Unbelievable.

You're such a bunch of pests! You guys think you're any help against an opponent like this? My goodness.

Could it be time to lend a hand? Not even No.18 would be able to take them all on.

Nothing left for me but to get in there.

Unless, No.16, you want to go? No, I'm not going.

Not going, huh? You really are slipshod.

Just what were you built for, anyhow? I thought I told you.

To kill Son Goku.

My, my, how nice for you to be so carefree.

H-Hey, No.

17 is headed this way.

Let's get out of here, Vegeta-san.

If you get killed, your pride won't be worth crap.

P- please! You want another beating? You're in our way! Get lost, now! If you want to run, you're free to do so.

We don't have any interest in that which flees.

Don't be ridiculous.

Why should I find it necessary to run when I'm about to obliterate you? Get this straight-If it comes down to fighting alongside Earthlings, or Nameks.

or Kakarrot, for that matter I'd rather fight by myself and die! Very nice commentary.


Coupled with your fighting style, you're every bit worthy to be prince of the Saiyans.

It's not up to you wind-up dolls to say so.

Particularly a kid like you.

However, in the hopes that each of you hold the code of Bushido dear, I'm putting you on notice.

but if you do, I will have to join in as well.

These guys are cowardly pacifists.

You don't have to trouble yourself for them to stay out of it.

Fine, then.

Shall we keep going? Of course we will! That's my boy! You're getting me irritated, pretending like nothing has happened.

You surprise me.

Even being an alien, I didn't think any man could push me this far.

Is the man Son Goku even stronger? Don't be absurd.


He may have pulled ahead for a while, but now, as it should be I'm stronger than he is.

You don't say.

Then you're not all that great, either one of you.

W- what was that! Go! Go get her! Incredible.

I hadn't realized that Dad was so incredible.

He's actually holding his own against one of those terrible Androids.

He's going to get killed.

Vegeta, I mean.

Watch! It's just a little bit each time, but the Android is starting to get the upper hand.

His opponent hardly loses any power, but for every move Vegeta makes, his stamina drops proportionately.


shoot! Dad!! No, you fool! Visit us at Freeze-subs.

co.

cc Visit us at Freeze-subs.

co.

cc Dad! O- one blow! And he was even a Super Saiyan! Dammit! No you don't! Damn you! How incredibly strong! What's up with him? Dammit! Looks like I'd better make sure you can't use your other arm, either.

His hair color changed back, and that strange glow is gone too.

Pretty unusual phenomenon, I'd say.

The one over there was the same way.

So what is it about him, then? I've got no data on this.

Not that it's important.

E- everyone's been beaten! Damn, you expect me to be beaten too? Don't worry.

They're all still alive.

Hurry and feed them those Senzu whatsits.

They should recover completely.

Tell them that if they manage to toughen up any, we're willing to take them on again.

Aren't you going to ask where Son Goku is? No worry.

It'll be more fun seeking it out for ourselves.

Besides, if we smash things around enough, he'll come to us.

Bye.

See you.

You're so bratty, No.

17.

You think so? What are you looking at, No.

16? You guys made all that noise, so the little birds flew away.

Little birds? Say, not too many cars pass through here.

Let's fly off to somewhere a little more busy.

There sure aren't any cars coming through here.

No choice but to fly on to somewhere busier.

That's fine with me.

I want to get some new clothes too.

Great.

So, let's go find a nearby town.

Yeah.

W- wait! What, you have some other errand with us? What is it you guys are after? Are you just out to kill Goku? Or are you just out to turn the world upside-down? For now, we're going to defeat Son Goku.

We'll think about what to do next after we're done.


B-But why!? Why go after Goku? You guys k*lled Doctor Gero, when he was the one who hated him! Doctor Gero doesn't figure into this.

This is all just a game.

A game, you say? That's the only purpose for all this? I said we didn't need to ask you where Son Goku was, right? This is the reason.

Looking for him is part of the game.

S- suppose, then, I were to ask you to stop.

Would it be any use? It wouldn't be any use.

We were created to kill Son Goku.

Like he said.

You'd better hurry and feed them those Senzu.

They'll die soon.

See ya.

Bye.

The Androids are overpoweringly strong! However, their character is somewhat unexpected.

Will Goku and the others be able to defend the Earth from them? Hey! I'm Goku! Piccolo what are you planning to do.


It's simple, to stop these androids we need more strength.

I've decided.

Kami-sama! Piccolo Daimao is heading this way.


The Time has Come to Become One Again... Piccolo's Decision for Ultimate Power!" 
  


Overwhelmed by the extremely powerful androids S- suppose, then, I were to ask you to stop.

Would it be any use? It wouldn't be any use.

See ya.

It's time to become one again Piccolo's strong determination! That's right, I have to help everyone! Let's see There are six Senzu left.

I just split them up between myself, Tenshinhan and Piccolo.

Hey, Tenshinhan, stay with us! Here, have a Senzu.

I guess I should feed one to Vegeta too.

Oh my! Bulma! Gohan-chan! Trunks-chan! Mama! We're back! My, welcome, all of you! Gohan-chan, look how big you're getting! You look so much more brawny every time I see you! Come, make a stay of it.

I'll prepare some cakes and tea right away.

There's no need to be so modest! Actually I have to hurry back to my father.

I'm stayin' for the chow 'fore I leave.

It's good manners.

Goodbye! Dear me, has he left already? I'm sure he must be busy.

I wonder what the matter is? What's the matter indeed? There's nothing like playing the wetnurse.



Now, I'd better hurry! What? You man they even knew the word "Senzu!?" What does it mean? If they knew so much, why didn't they k*ll us? Good question.

Are they saying they don't need to k*ll us? That we're no match for them!? Of course they are.

Those guys are incredibly strong.

They're too strong! How could anyone have guessed they were as strong as that? Vegeta! Trunks! Don't go after him! Stop! Leave him alone.

He had become a Super Saiyan, and utterly regained all of his pride and self-assuredness.

And yet, even though they were Androids, he was soundly beaten by a woman.

His shock must be pretty great.

As for the rest of us, to think that we even teamed up on them and couldn't beat them I'm sorry.

My legs just cowered on me, and I wasn't able to fight with you.

Don't worry about it.

Our opponents were such that Trunks had even turned Super Saiyan yet he was still all but defeated in one blow.

If you had joined in, there's not a thing you could have done.



Dammit, if only Goku were healthy! This guy easily took care of even Freeza.

And yet, he was powerless to do anything against the Androids.

Let's be frank.

No matter how strong Goku may be, he can't be that much different from Vegeta or Trunks.

There's absolutely no one who can beat them, Goku included! They were also somewhat different from the Androids I knew.



How do you mean? The ones I know didn't have this kind of unbelievable strength.

I was able to at least hold my own against their strength.

No way.

At any rate, the path ahead is in complete darkness.

What should we do now? First, you guys go to Son Goku's house and move him to a different location.


Whatever we do next, we can't think of doing it until Goku recovers.

That's for sure.

So, Piccolo, what are you planning to do? Who knows.

W- what's up with that expression on your face? You must have some kind of strategy, right? Come on, tell us! We're all friends here! Friends, you say? Don't get carried away with yourself! When did I ever become friends with any of you!? I am a demon clansman! Don't you ever forget- I'm just using you to help me take over the world! That's right, I'd completely forgotten.


He is, after all, the reincarnation of Piccolo Daimao, who Goku and I fought against so long ago.

Damn, don't tell me Piccolo is still bent on world domination.

All his talk about scheming to take over the world? I don't think he means it.

He's just like Goku or Vegeta.

I bet all he thinks about is being stronger than anyone else.

Therefore, he's flown off to take the very last measure left in his reserve.

Probably so, anyway.

What is this last measure you're talking about? Piccolo flew off in that direction.

Do you know what's over there? That direction? Beats me.

Nothing comes to mind.

Is it somewhere I know of? Kami-sama's place.

Kami-sama's!? When I was on Namek, the Grand Elder-san told me something.

He said if Kami-sama and Piccolo hadn't split up, they could have stood up to even a Saiyan.


What I'm saying is, I think Piccolo has gone to Kami-sama's place in order to become his one, original self again.

What? If Kami-sama and Mao join bodies, they'll return to a Namekian warrior.

However, since Piccolo is so much more powerful now, they'll become an exceptional warrior! If Goku and company are Super Saiyans, then Piccolo would be a Super Namekian! Super Namekian? That's incredible! But if so, and Kami-sama disappears, won't the Dragonballs also vanish? Yeah, probably so.

But if Piccolo or Kami-sama were to get k*lled, the Dragonballs would vanish anyhow.

If Piccolo really is planning on reuniting with Kami-sama If he really plans to go this far to beat those androids, it should tell us how fearsome they are.

Even though Piccolo totally hates Kami-sama.

What is my fath-I mean, Vegeta-san planning to do? Hey, there's no need to hide it any more, Trunks.

We all know you're the grown-up version of the baby Bulma-san was holding.

The only one who doesn't know is your father, Vegeta.

Is that so? Please excuse me.

It's really nothing you need to apologize for.

Vegeta is definitely not the type to run away just because he's lost a battle.

He's nearly the incarnation of pride itself.

I'm sure he'll come up with some new finishing technique.

He'll be back to face the Androids again.

Yeah.

Damn those Android bastards! Toy with me, will they!? They're going to regret turning me, Vegeta-sama, back without finishing the job! Say, Trunks, how long will it take Goku to get better with that medicine you gave him? Knowing Goku-san, I'd say he'll be fine in ten days or so.

Ten days, huh? I think we can manage to keep him hidden that long.

Yeah, one way or another.

Although, the idea of Goku getting better and winning this fight seems a little too good to be true now.

In any case, we're lucky those three don't seem to have any kind of radar device that can track our power.

Right.

So, Piccolo, you've finally made your decision? I think it's time for us to become one again Visit us at Freeze-subs.

co.

cc Visit us at Freeze-subs.

co.

cc K- Kami-sama You must know why it is I've come to this place.

Yes, I know.

Originally, me and you-or more accurately, your father-were a single person.

I imagine I understand what it is you are thinking.

In that case, I won't waste my breath.

Quite honestly, I did not think the day would come that our destinies should come together again.

We won't be fusing together.

You will serve only as the means for a super power-up for Piccolo.

The only justification you have for your existence any more are the Dragonballs! I- it can't be! Your words are true indeed.

Before I had realized it, you had opened up a great difference between our powers.

As you faced one great opponent after another, my powers were becoming all but inadequate.

K- Kami-sama, that not true! Kami-sama has duty as Kami-sama! It's quite all right, Mister Popo.

Even Trunks, who was able to bury Freeza and his father in a moment's time As well as Trunks' father Vegeta, possessed of an even greater ability than Trunks were brought to such a terrible state by the Androids.

Even when Son Goku recovers from his affliction, he will likely meet with similar results.

It appears the time for Kami and Daimao to become one again has come after all.

That's right.

What the earth needs right now is not a Kami, it's me, coupled with the super power I need to defeat those guys.

Provided that we observe events for a short while longer.

What's that? Observe!? Correct.

To determine whether or not those three will bring harm to the earth.

How can you say such a leisurely thing!? After the way they- You were the ones who picked that fight! Besides which, they did not attempt to kill any of you.

You disgust me.

While you were up here, looking on at the world from afar, did you not hear what Trunks came to say? He told us that the future lies in ruins because of them! I also heard that the future Androids that Trunks knows are somewhat different from these current Androids.

I don't suppose you're thinking that these guys might actually be little darlings? I'm not saying anything of the sort.

But if this is to be the last judgment I make as myself, then I would like a conclusive reason to proceed.

You worthless coward! Fine, very well then.

I'll be waiting right here.

Waiting until the irrevocable happens, and you finally make up your mind.

A car! We finally found one.

We're fine! Why don't we just keep on flying? There's no reason for us hurry.

We have the time.

Well, well You're just pulling my leg.

No, it's true.

I was shocked.

These packages are in the way.

Hey, you! What do you think you're doing!? Well then, we're off.

First stop, Son Goku's home.

Before that, I said I wanted some new clothes.

All right, all right.

What am I, dreaming? Could be.

Hey, Krilin! I'm going to go pick up Chaozu and continue our training.

You are? If the situation gets bad once again, I'll be back.

Not that I think it'll help, but anything I can do Gotcha.

We'll take Goku and move him to where Muten Roshi-sama is.

We should be able to buy him quite a bit of time there.

Tell Goku for me not to overdo it.

Okay.

Don't overdo it.

He's right, you know.

This time, not even Goku has a chance.

How could history be turning out this differently? The Androids weren't supposed to be this incredibly powerful.

And there were only supposed to be two of them.

How should I know why? At any rate, this time around, this is the reality.

Here, Goku-sa There it is! That's Goku's home! Say, can I ask you something? T- those Androids You're sure they're all rotten to the core? They're unbelievably cold-blooded.

At least they are in my era.

Why do you ask? Oh, yeah, well, I was just thinking, it'd be great for us, you know, if they weren't.

I think you're better off not entertaining such dubious hopes.

Y- yeah, of course, you're right.

I was just thinking, is all.

See ya! Gohan-chan!? Oh, it's Krilin-san.

Nice to see you.

It's Goku's wife.

N- nice to meet you.

Krilin! You're all right! Thank goodness, we've been worried! How's Goku!? He's okay.

He took the medicine and he's sleeping now.

You're the one from the future I get it! You beat the Androids for us, right? N- no.

I'll fill you in on everything later.

Right now, we have to hurry and move to Muten Roshi's place.

All of us.

What? There are three new, even more terrifying Artificial Humans, and they'll be here any time.

T- this is terrible.

Gently, now! Gently! So these new Androids are all that strong, then? Yeah.

And "strong" just doesn't cover it.

Now we just have to wait for Gohan.

He took Bulma home, right? He's back! Gohan-chan! Why is everyone here? Thank goodness! Thank goodness you came back unhurt! H- has something happened? I'll tell you later, hurry and get in the plane.

Damn it all! This isn't over until I make you Androids realize that I am the strongest warrior in the universe! You think I'm going to let it go that easily!? For the time being, a temporary evacuation has been accomplished.

However, even then, the sound of a new mystery was about to make itself known to Bulma Yo, it's Bulma! Trunks, you should keep your face straight, kids would really like you.

Right now we are going there.

By the way, we got some strange information.

I have a bad feeling about it.


One More Time Machine?! Bulma Unveils a Mystery"   

Androids looking for Goku Elsewhere, Krilin and others are desperately trying to keep them away from him.

Another time machine!? The mystery Bulma uncovered so, to them it's like a game, but in any case, they intended to come kill Goku.

A- are they really all that strong? Yep.

You can even think of them as stronger than what Trunks warned us about.

This is terrible! All this time's been gettin' away while we've been sittin' here.

What a waste! What's the matter, Mother? Well, get to it! At a time like this? No matter what time it is, studyin' is important! You really are something else, Chichi-san.

So what do we do now? Not that I would know What should we do? H- how does this sound? What if I took the time machine back further into the past, and destroy them before they're activated? I know the location of Doctor Gero's laboratory and all I get you.

That's a good idea, isn't it? Hold on.

I thought your time machine didn't quite work perfectly, did it? And from what Goku said, it takes an awfully long time to store enough energy to make a round trip, right? If you go further into the past, are you sure you can return to your future? 
Not exactly. 
You know, I was thinking, if Trunks-san goes back a little further in time, and even if you're able to destroy the Androids there, what will happen to the Androids that are here now? Will they suddenly disappear? 
T- that's right! I'd forgotten! Undoubtedly, if I were to go back to the past and destroy the Androids, the future of that world of that time would be saved.

But in this world, where the Androids are already activated, nothing would be changed.

How does that follow? Let's see For example, Goku-san managed to hold on to his life with the heart medicine I brought him from the future.

However, in my future, Goku remains long dead from his heart disease.

In other words, while there may be a future where Goku-san survives, there's still another one where he died.

From very minor events, many different futures are created.



Just a minute, Trunks You mean, even supposing that Goku is capable of defeating the Androids, In your future, won't they still exist there, same as ever? That's right.

In that case, Trunks, what did you even come here for? After all, your world won't be changed.



Mom Mom was so ticked off by us always being clobbered by the Androids, she thought it would be nice if there was a peaceful future where they had been beaten.

But her primary goal was to have me fight with Goku against the Androids, to find a weakness in them.

If that didn't work, I would have had Goku come to our future to defeat them there, or something like that.

Forgive me.

Anyhow, it appears I've come to a different past than the one I knew of.

The timing of Goku-san's heart disease was off, for one.

For another, there are now three Androids Their strength so much greater B- but why is it that so many things are different? I don't know.

Why is it this bad? I- is it because of me coming back in the time machine? There's nothin' for you to be frettin' about.

If you hadn't come, Goku would've died from his sickness.

I'm terribly grateful to you.

That's the right idea.

Something's going to turn up.

Y- yeah, absolutely right! We've been through so much before.

Something's bound to come up this time too! Isn't it? Incidentally, do you even know where he is? This Son Goku? We'll come across that information before long,.

You mean you don't know? My, my, I suppose it's just a matter of time.

There is a mountain village in eastern sector 439 where Son Goku's house is located.

You're quite the know-it-all.

Did you learn that from Doctor Gero? That's right.

If we flew, we could be there in a matter of minutes.

Isn't that the truth! You say all the right things.

Yet you still want to take the trouble to drive there.

What's the point? Stop saying that.

The point is to have fun, isn't it? Is the man Son Goku even stronger? No kidding? Neither one of you is all that great, are you? Wasn't the Super Saiyan supposed to be invincible throughout the land!? So what happened!? How did it come to that-that debacle I suffered? I- I am the super-elite prince of the Saiyans! And then, by becoming a Super Saiyan, I should have been greatest in the universe! Is it because my opponents were Androids? Is this the most I will ever be? No! There's still more to be had! I am Vegeta! No matter how strong my enemy is, I will surpass them! I will surpass them! Count on it! And Kakarrot, after I beat the Androids, you're next! We'll be at Muten Roshi-sama's island pretty soon.

Say, Krilin, shouldn't you let Bulma know what's been going on? Yes, you're right.

But you want me to contact her? Aw, man You're the one who knows the situation best.

Please? All right.

Your mother sure has a sharp tongue.

She's no different in the future.

Er, this is Krilin calling, is Bulma-san there? Ah, yes, Mistress Bulma.

One moment please.

Krilin-kun! What, you mean you're okay? Where are you calling from? I thought Gohan-kun should have been back by now, but when I called his house, no one was there.

Wait, never mind that, is the future, grown-up son of mine, Trunks there? Yes, he's right here.

He's there? Great! Would you let me speak to him? You can go ahead and talk now, he can hear you over the speaker.

Okay.

Well, the company here got an inquiry from some folks in a rural area to the west.

They came across a strange abandoned vehicle, and they wanted to keep it for themselves.

However, they couldn't figure out for the world how to start it up, and they were asking if we could tell them.

Right.

So we asked them over the phone what model vehicle it was, but they didn't know.

We asked them if they were sure it was one of our products, and they said, It says right here on the body, 'Capsule Corporation'.

We told them, in that case, please send us a photo, and they did.

I was so surprised when I saw the photo! It was the time machine Trunks rode in, but it's damaged! That can't be right No, it's right here.

I turned it into a capsule and took it with me.

He says it's right here with him.

I see, naturally So this isn't the one he came in.

There's some moss or something stuck to it, making it seem pretty old, so I thought it was kind of strange.

Say, how many time machines did my future self build? How many? It was all she could manage to make just one.

That's strange.

This is definitely a time machine.

I saw the one you were in before, so I couldn't mistake it.

Hey, do you have a fax there? Take a look at this photo! Trunks, here.

Unmistakable.

This is the same time machine I rode back in.

What does this mean? 

Does she know the exact location of where this photo was taken? He asks if you know exactly where this time machine is.

It doesn't say exactly, but.

I think it has to be somewhere around Sector 1050 West.

Are you going? Yes.

I'd like to see this with my own eyes.

Well, I'm going too.

It's not too far from here.

U- understood.

See you later.

You're sure there's only one time machine, then? Yes, positive.

Um I'll go looking with you.

Is that okay if I come? Gohan-chan! It's all right, Mother.

We aren't going anywhere dangerous, so you needn't worry.

Ah, here's some water for you! Mama, I have to go out for a bit, can you watch Trunks? Goodness! Bulma-chan, where are you off to? I have to go meet up with the big Trunks.

Um, Trunks-san, in the future, you say your world was really devastated, because of those two Androids? Yes.

The world's population has been reduced to several tens of thousands.

Most of Metro West lies in a state of ruin.

Somehow, we manage to survive by hiding in secret underground bases.

That bad? I sure hope we can find some weakness in the Androids.

Yeah.

There was that time The two Androids went against Doctor Gero.

But he was so far into the corner by then, he had no choice but to use them.

In the end, he was k*lled by them.

However, Doctor Gero must have determined how dangerous they were, using progressively riskier tests.

I think he must have had some kind of device to shut them down in an emergency.

If he hadn't, do you think he would have reactivated them? Of course, that must be it! There's a slim possibility Section 1050 West should be under us now.

Let's start looking.

There it is! Trunks-san, it's over here! Way to find it, Gohan-san! That must be Bulma-san.

I'll lead her down here.

Hey, No.16.

You really are the silent type, aren't you? Don't you find it dull keeping all bottled up like that? Give it up, No.18.

He's got nothing on his mind except killing Son Goku.

Besides which, we're coming up on a town.

You're still looking to get some new clothes, right? You bet! I can finally part ways with these torn-up rags.

Speed up, already! Stay where you are! Don't make any funny moves! There's no mistake! This is the stolen vehicle, all right! Okay, then.

We're taking you in for questioning.

Hey, you, get out! Come out of there! Don't try anything! Why you! Are you resisting!? He calls that resisting.

You know what, Officer? If you want to see someone resisting Hey, hold it! What are you doing? Doing something like this is called resisting.

Shall we go? Hi, Trunks! It's your beautiful mother! Indeed.

Well? Let me know what you think, seeing your mom all young like this.

I- it's just Mom, you don't really change that much.

I don't change? That means I'll keep my beauty for decades to come! I hope no one blames me for it.

More to the point, please look at this.

This is the time machine I came in, and had reduced to a Capsule.

Gee, then there's no way this older one could be yours.

Not exactly.

You only built one time machine in the future.

This is also the very same time machine I used to come back in.

No way.

Look at this.

Hope? Yeah.

These are the letters you wrote here when I took off.

Naturally, they appear on the other time machine as well.

But how can that be? It looks like this one has been here for quite a while.

Hmm? This hole is strange.

It's like the glass melted from intense heat.

But this hole was made from the inside.

S-so, what? Was anyone inside this one? In any event, let's open this up.

Excuse me.

There's one here, too.

What's that you've got? It doesn't appear to be a coconut.

What? Say, give me a look.

Here.

No doubt about it.

This is some kind of eggshell.

Eggshell? If that's an egg, I've never seen another egg like it.

Do you suppose that whatever made that hole hatched from the egg? The energy reserves are almost on zero.

It came here from Age 788? That's three years later than the time I left! Three more years into the future! It arrived in this era Nearly four years ago! This arrived here fully a year before I appeared the first time.

W- what could have come back in here, and for what purpose? Could this be the reason history has changed so drastically? Still peeping down on the lower realm? Can't say I approve of your little pastime.

I guess that ability will likely disappear once you become one with me.

Enjoy it now, while you still can.

So, the uneasiness I've felt in my heart these last four years, it was not a result of the Androids after all.

I'm not sure what it is either.

What did come back in that time machine? What? All I know is that there is a life form down on Earth somewhere, one that possesses an even greater power than even the Androids.

What are you talking about!? Tell me what's going on! To be sure, the day when I turn to Piccolo and forsake my office as Kami, and we stand together as one has finally arrived.

Very soon now, something terrible will happen on Earth.

This is not the kind of crisis Earth has faced so many times before.

I have a hopelessly dreadful feeling about this.

A being that comes from a future even beyond Trunks'.

Elsewhere, the Androids continue to pursue Goku.

What's going to happen? This time it's me, Kami! The strange uneasiness I had been feeling wasn't because of androids.

We don't have time for chatter.

Kami, make up your mind already! It's about time for Kami and Daimao to become one and fight together.


And So the Monster Makes its Move... Take Off! It's the Super Namekian!"   


Another time machine but for what purpose was it here? Very soon now, something terrible will happen on Earth.

This is not the kind of crisis Earth has faced so many times.

I have a hopelessly dreadful feeling about this.

And the monster appears Appearance! It's Super Namek! and that's how it went.

All of that happened, huh? It'd be great if Goku were able to get better before they come looking here.

All we can do now is pray that he does.

You know, I really am a genius! I build a time machine in the future, after all! In any case, we can't just leave these time machines sitting around.

For now, let's turn them back into Capsules.

I'll return this one to a Capsule.

Yes, please do.

I'll take this strange eggshell with me.

Yes, be my guest.

Bulma-san, The rest of us, we've gotten together at Muten Roshi-sama's home.

The Kame House? How come? Long story short, three Artificial Humans have been reactivated, and are aiming to take my father's life.

But, since Father is down with his illness, in his state, they took him there to hide him from them.

Well, why don't the whole lot of you just get together and put them all away? You must be kidding! Dad, Myself, Piccolo-san and Tenshinhan-san all took them on, but we were powerless against them! Wow, they really must be incredible.

How's Vegeta? Is he all right? Did Vegeta go to the Kame House with you? He survived with the help of a Senzu bean.

But Dad didn't join up with us.

He went off somewhere else.

That's just like him.

What is it? Nothing, I'm just wondering what that is Huh? What, where? Please, come have a look at this! What, what's wrong? What is it, Gohan-san? Over there.

What is that? It's huge.

What made this? I- is it dead? It isn't dead; it's a shell that's been cast-off.

A shell? You mean the cicadas grow this big around here? There are no cicadas like this.

Could it be? Probably, this is from whatever came out of the egg back in the time machine.

Yeah.

It must have started growing, and then shed its skin.

What does that mean? What could have possibly come out of a skin like this? I don't know.

I've never seen anything like this.

But how did it come to be here? Who could have sent this egg back through time? For that matter, someone could have come back with this egg as well.

I don't have any idea what's going on any more.

Whatever came out of here, it must have just barely happened.

What do you think? In all honesty, you've got a bad feeling about this too? Yes! Well, I guess I should get out of here.


You guys will be at the Kame House, right? If anything happens, I'll be in touch.

Right.

Trunks, if you get the time, come visit! Grandma and Grandpa will love it! What exactly is happening now? I don't know! I absolutely do not know! Trunks-san Trunks-san!? Er, yes? What do you suppose that strange shedding was, anyhow? I- I don't know.

For one thing, we don't have creatures like that in my era, either.


You said it came back a whole year earlier than the time you arrived three years ago, which makes it a full four years ago that it arrived in this era, right? Yeah.

That's what the chronometer inside the time machine indicated.

So without anyone realizing it, a creature that came from a good 23 years into the future has been growing and developing on our earth for the last four years.

Yeah.

Who could possibly have sent that creature, and for what purpose? These are? These are the best clothes the store has? Yes, quite so.

They look very flattering on you.

How do you like them? How do you think I like them? They're the absolute worst.

But considering how rural this place is, I guess I'll have to make do for now.

See you.

E- excuse me, ma'am, you haven't paid! Hey! How frightful! Hello, is this the police? My store has been robbed! T- they drove away in It's the police again.

They're sure starting to get bothersome.

Don't you find this a little painful to just be dreaming? We interrupt this program to bring you this late breaking news.

About an hour ago, we took a number of calls from Gingertown, a suburban area of Metro West.

We immediately dispatched an investigate crew to the scene, but according to their report, the town's citizens seem to have all suddenly vanished.

There is no sign of anyone.

Gingertown? This cause for this unexpected state of affairs is currently under investigation, as we Yes, hello? Hello? It's Bulma.

Who's this? Krilin? Yes, it's Krilin.

Gohan and Trunks? No, they haven't come back yet.

Okay, turn on your  TV there.

It's probably on every channel by now, but I'm watching it on channel 872.

Has something happened? Just hurry! What's the matter? Who is it? It's Bulma-san.

She wants us to watch  TV.

We've just received some new information.

According to the investigation of our on-the-scene crew, the clothing of the apparent victims of this incident is being discovered in great numbers.

Our camera crew has just arrived in the area, so let's go there for a live update.

W- what could this be? I've just arrived here in Gingertown, where over 15,000 residents have suddenly vanished.

We have just made a new discovery.

15,000? There are many sets of clothing here.

It appears as if the people inside them simply melted away.

As you can see in these images, from the outlay of the clothing and the presence of the r*fles, it appears they were fighting against something W- what's this? T- the Androids! So, they've finally started! I don't think so.

And I think that Gohan-kun and Trunks will say the same thing.

Which means, you think there might be some kind of link to the other time machine? I don't think there can be any doubt.

Have Gohan-kun and Trunks tell you everything when they get there.

Right.

Goku-sa's sleepin' tight now.

He seems to be restin' a lot easier than before.

Muten Roshi-sama! Forgive the intrusion.

Uh, Krilin-san? G- guys, come watch this news, then answer me a question.

News? What's this? We heard a scream just a moment ago.

gunfire! We're hearing gunfire.

It appears that the investigative team or the police in this direction are agitated! It's become quiet once again.

We're going to move in as close as we can to see.

What is it!? What is happening!? Come on!! K- Kami-sama! W- what is it? What is that monster? Did you say monster? What do you mean, monster!? Say something!! What? Change it to a different channel! Right.

Help us! The screaming has stopped.

Enough already! Stop keeping it all to yourself! You're going to tell me exactly what you saw.

Hey! V- very well.

All right, start talking.

What kind of monster did you see in the lower realm? There's no need for me to bother speaking.

Once you and I merge and become one being, you'll know what it is I saw.

K- Kami-sama! So, you've finally made up your mind, then? You must have seen some kind of monster, all right.

Let's hurry this up.

We cannot allow there to be any more victims.

All right! We will be fundamentally based on who I am now, got that? That will be fine.

You are much younger than I, and have a far greater power.

It is a matter of course.

I serve as nothing more than a means to power up, and to contribute my vast wisdom.

Now, since you are to be the base, you will place your hand upon me.

Right.

K- Kami-sama! The time is upon us, Mister Popo.

Right now what the earth needs is not a Kami but rather, the mighty.

Piccolo has changed.

The evil in his heart has mostly disappeared.

Once we merge, it is unlikely we will ever need to divide again.

Thank you for all your help, Mister Popo.

K- Kami-sama! F- farewell, Kami-sama.

Don't die.

I am neither Kami nor Piccolo any longer.

I'm a Namekian who has long since forgotten his name.

So then, I'm off.

We have received no further reports from the scene.

In all likelihood, our own staff members have become victims of this same incident.

So, you think it's because of whatever monster came out of that shell, then? Yeah, probably.

That's what I think.

The locations are pretty close, an' all.

I'm going to go make sure.

Hey! Hold it! It's okay.

I can become a Super Saiyan.

The ones we should really be fearful of are the Androids.

M- maybe so, but I- I'm going too! You can't go! Goku-sa is still sleepin' up there! Why can't you behave a little better!? Mother, it's exactly because father is sick that I No way! Even if the whole universe is blowin' up, you'll stay at my side! You mean? I'll go by myself.

Gohan-san, if anything happens, you and the others have to be here, to protect Goku-san from the Androids.

Right.

Very well.

Hey, don't do anything crazy.

If it gets dangerous, come back here quick, okay? Yeah, he's right.

We need you in the fight against Androids.

Right.

Now then, I'll be back.

So, you've shown yourself, you beast.

The mysterious monster finally reveals himself.

The world slips into a state of hopelessness previously unknown.

Hey! I'm Goku! Don't let your guard down, Piccolo! What the hell is this? This feeling Is it Freeza!? 
What's going on!? Vegeta No it can't be! This energy 


I am Your Sibling! The Monster with the Ki of Goku" 
  
A mysterious monster from a future four years later than Trunks' had arrived in the time machine.

Faced with this terrible threat, Piccolo, who had merged with Kami-sama, descended into the city alone to determine what it was.

So, you've shown yourself, monster.

W-What is this Ki I'm sensing from him?!

I-It can't be...

W-What's going on here?


Goku-sa is gettin' much better, huh?

That's terrific, Mother.

G-Goku-sa!

Father!

Huh?

He went back to sleep again.

But he should be waking up any time, huh?

Yep.

I'm going to go tell Oolong-san and the others.

Hey, help me!

Hey, come on, give me some help!

I'm the richest man in this town!

I'll pay you as much as you want, just help me!

Hey, you, come on!

I doubt you can understand what I'm saying, but let him go.

His life, such that it is, is still a life.

H-Hey, help me!

You'll end up like this next...Piccolo Daimao.

W-What? Is this...?

I-Is that...?

W-What are you?! How do you know the name Piccolo?!

I am your brother.

What?!

Hey, what is the deal with that Ki?

It's Freeza and his father's Ki...

I-I can sense others, too.

Piccolo-san, Freeza and his father, as well as Dad...

All of these Ki are gathered together in one spot.

W-What is going on here? This is impossible!

Yeah, I'm sensing them, all right.

But this can't be happening.

Freeza and his father are supposed to be dead.

The direction it's coming from...

Yes, it's coming from the direction of Gingertown, where that incident is taking place.

This is impossible...!

Goku's Ki, as well?

Father is sleeping, right there!

Section West...

Right next to where that casting and the egg were.

There can be no doubt about it.

Hey, tell me what you are!
Start talking, in detail!

There won't be any need for that.

You are about to become my meal.

I see, so you're not going to talk, then?

In that case, I'll just wring the life out of you without knowing what you are.

Piccolo Daimao intends to kill me?

For whatever reason, you seem to know who Piccolo is.

However...

However, unfortunately for you...you've got the wrong person.

What?!

I've got the wrong person?

Are you saying that you're not Piccolo Daimao?

That's what I'm saying.

Good, I made it in time.

We don't know anything about this monster, and even you could find yourself in danger.

There's another tremendous Ki now. 
Something else has presented itself.

Yeah, just now.

What in the world is going on?

That's Piccolo!

But isn't this Ki too far removed from Piccolo-san?

This is awesome! He really did the merge!

Merge? You mean, with Kami-sama?

The one from whom he originally split?

Yeah, that's right.

And since Piccolo was already incredibly strong...

This is the Ki of a Super Namekian!

I-It's outstanding...

Could he really power up that much?

The fact that you've eliminated all of the residents of this town works out in my favor.

What?

What do you mean by that?

It means that I can go all-out.

What?!

Th-That shockwave just now...!

Over there... it's started...

The atmosphere just shook. Could you tell?

Yeah.

Did a volcano just undergo a huge explosion? Or something else?

Whatever the case, it was far away.

The outskirts of Metro West.

No. ...

There are probably two great powers fighting each other.

You're equipped with a power radar?

Why didn't you say anything before?

You didn't ask.

Hmph, you don't say.
Well, as long as you're at it, why don't you tell us who is fighting whom?

I don't know. Neither one of them is in my data.

All I know is that one of them has power enough to rival you two.

What?

Hmph, looks like Doctor Gero screwed up again.

That radar of yours is malfunctioning.

There's no one in this world whose power can rival mine.

It's absurd.

Let's go, No.16.

Th-That was...!

Is that the best you've got?

I doubt that I was mistaken about sensing that you were such a tremendous monster.

You're not so bad either, are you?

Even though I have not yet attained my perfect form...

Huh? Perfect form?

Y-You mean...

That's why you've been attacking people?

I take them as bioenergy.

Answer me this!

Who was it that sent you into this era with the time machine?!

Was it one of your pals?

I'm the one who sent me.

The time machine was too small for this body, so it was necessary for me to devolve myself back into an egg.

Though I have to say I'm surprised you knew about the time machine.

Even so...I doubt you know about this, as well...

Th-That stance...

it can't be... You're kidding, right?

F-Father...

I-it couldn't be...!

Ka...me...ha...me...

Th-This isn't happening...

...Ha!!

It's the real thing!

Your life is mine!

I hit your arm, did I? Well, it's all the same.

I will now take your powerful life's essence.

Kami-sama...

Something the matter, No.16 ?

There was a fluctuation in one of those power readings.

It looks like they've reached a conclusion.

One of those powers? You mean, the one that you said rivaled ours?

Yes.

Hmph, are you still going on about that?

Your power radar is faulty, No.16.

There's no way that anyone in this world could have a power that rivals ours.

Don't make me keep saying it.

You managed to get away, but you can't use that arm anymore.

It looks like the tables have now been turned.

Indeed they have.

I can no longer maintain balance, making things much harder for me.

Unfortunately, it looks like you've won.

You can't help but give up the battle, but you should be glad.

Once I absorb as much bioenergy as you have, I will be much closer to attaining my perfect form.

You will be of assistance to me.
Doesn't that please you?

Before I get absorbed by you, you have to let me know...

What exactly are you?!

Why do you possess the Ki of Son Goku, Freeza, and the rest, and how are you able to do the Kamehame-Ha?!

Very well. You're going to die anyway. I'll tell you.

My name is Cell. I'm an Artificial Human.

A-Artificial Human?

What's this? The monster identified himself as "Cell."



Escape Tactic, Taiyoken! Chase after the Artificial Human Cell"   



I was born of the computer that Doctor Gero used.

Again with Doctor Gero?

Once upon a time, Doctor Gero collected the cells of the masters of combat, and began research on Artificial Humans that could be synthesized from those cells, but because it required too much time, he gave up on it midway through.

However, his computer continued to work on it.

Piccolo...

...Son Goku...

...and Vegeta's cells were collected after the battle when Vegeta first came to Earth.

Hmph, Goku from back then, huh?

That would explain why your Kamehame-Ha was no big deal.

Additionally, when Freeza and his father arrived on Earth, we were fortunate enough to come by their cells as well.

We could have acquired the cells of the one named Trunks, but we already had plenty of Saiyan contributors.

H-How did you get the cells?

A-At the time, there wasn't anyone remarkable around!

You must have heard from Gero.

He had spy robots observing your actions.

Tiny robots the size of a bee.
No one would notice them.

They took the cells. Look closely.

There should be one there, even now, collecting data on these events and relaying them to the computer.

Perhaps it wants to collect your cells as well.

Damn you!

It's too late to destroy it now.

It has already collected the necessary cells, and the research has begun.

Although I won't be completed for another 20 years into the future.

Impossible! We destroyed Doctor Gero's laboratory!

The computer is located in an underground room beneath the laboratory.

So that's it.

Why did you wait three years after arriving in this era to go from an egg into what you are now?

Once I revert to my egg form, I mature as a larva once again for three years.

It just takes that much time.

That is enough. it's about time that I absorb you.

One last question!

For what reason did you come here from the future?

It takes more than absorbing the life's essence of humans for me to reach my perfect form.

It is necessary for me to incorporate two essential, special life forms.

The computer told me that those two special life forms...

...were the Artificial Humans No.17 and No.18, created by Doctor Gero.

What?!

However, they were not around in the future that I'm from.

I don't know how he did it, but Trunks had managed to defeat No.17 and No.18.

But luckily for me, Trunks had a time machine.

After killing Trunks, I came to this era in the time machine in search of No.17 and No.18.

W-Why did you choose this era?

Who can say? Trunks' time machine had been set to come to this time, and all I did was push the button.

So that's it.

Trunks probably managed to destroy the Artificial Humans in the future, and had set it so he could come back here and inform us.

B-But then he showed up.

The computer also told me this...

Once I attain my perfect form, I will be able to achieve a terrifying power beyond imagination.

For what reason?! Why do you seek such overwhelming power?!

Ha, for what reason?
That's a pointless question.

The computer had only been programmed with instructions to create something strong.

Right up to the limit of what it could conceive.

Or perhaps it's the blood of the Saiyans, Freeza, and Piccolo that drives me to seek it.

That follows.

Now, that should be enough.

Thanks. I was able to unravel the mystery surrounding you.

You've been quite informative.

Y-You...

You tricked me into talking...!

I'm not going to let you reach your perfect form.

Considering that you have my blood, you really blew it by not realizing I could regenerate my arm.

Cell, even taking into account the energy you drained from my arm...my strength is still far greater than yours.

Say your prayers.

That was nice thinking, pretending you lost your arm to fool me into telling you all that.

Fairly clever of you, wasn't it?

That wasn't me; that was the wisdom of the former Kami.

What?

So that's it.

You're the result of Piccolo and Kami merging together.

That's right. Ha, you finally figured it out?

Which would mean that the Dragon Balls are gone, too.

If anyone dies, there's no coming back to life.

That actually works to my favor.

No wonder you seem so strong, despite looking every bit like Piccolo Daimao.

You still don't know what my true power is, but I'll show you that true power, right now!

No doubt about it.
He's merged with Kami-sama.

Who's that guy over there?

That's probably it-- the monster that came out of that shell.

Trunks? Why is he here?

I get it. He's come to this era in the time machine, as well.

The fool! He got himself killed by me in the future, and now he's going to be killed by me in this era, too.

I-It's a monster...

Y-Yeah.

I-Is that what killed the people of Gingertown?

Yeah. Watch out for his tail.

He wiped out all of the people here with it.

Why am I sensing Goku, Tenshinhan, and the others' Ki from him?

I'll explain it all later.

Putting this guy away comes first.

Putting me away?

Do you really think... it's going to be that easy?

It spoke!

Under the circumstances, I doubt you have much chance of winning.

Indeed, I have little choice but to withdraw for now.

You're not getting away!

You can't escape using the sort of Kamehame-Ha you used earlier!

Kamehame-Ha?! How is he able to perform Goku's Kamehame-Ha?!

Not just the Kamehame-Ha, Kuririn.

If I wanted to, I could probably create even a Genki Dama.

Holy cow! How does he know my name, as well?!

When Goku hears about this, I'm sure he'll be stunned.

Son Goku is still alive, is he?

Of course he is!

So he's still alive, huh?

Then it seems that history is a bit different from the one I know.

I will acquire No.17 and No.18, no matter what it takes.

If you try to prevent me from reaching my perfect form, you won't succeed.
Not if Piccolo is the only one who can put up a decent fight against No.17 and No.18.

What?!

I-Isn't that--?

Taiyo-ken!!

A-Aw, crap!

Damn it!

He got away!

Damn it all!

Kuririn, I thought the Taiyo-ken was Tenshinhan's move!

The Taiyo-ken isn't all that difficult a move.

Both Goku and I can do it, too.

Why, that rotten...!

He's masking his presence.
He can even do that.

What pushovers. I won't ever let them catch me again.

If I move around with my Ki in check like this, they have no way of finding me!

I've got a bad feeling about this.

One of the two guys with the unusual, ridiculously high battle powers has disappeared.

B-But the other one is still there.

It's not No.17 or one of the other Artificial Humans.

They didn't give off any presence at all. So just who is it?

Hey, just so you know, I don't like these clothes.

If you come across a nice town, be sure to stop.

Yeah, I know.

I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, huh?

I have to avoid their notice and absorb a lot more human bioenergy, and raise my power higher and higher.

And if Piccolo or the others spot me, I'll just relocate again.

Then, once my power is greater than No.17 and No.18,

I'll force them to combine with me.

"Welcome! Nickytown, 5 km ahead"

The thing that concerns me most is the existence of a controller that can execute a shutdown on No.17 and No.18.

You dumb-ass! Are you trying to get killed?!

Come on, don't just stand there, get out of the way!

Once they are no longer operative, it will be simple for them to destroy even No.17 and No.18.

But luckily, that controller no longer exists.

--What is this?
--What's going on?

Vegeta?

He hasn't gotten himself killed by No.17 and No.18 ?

What's more, his power is much greater than I expected.

Hey, you crazy punk!

Move it, before you get hurt!

It might be a good idea to hurry this along.

These guys may be able to help increase my bioenergy somewhat.

Damn it, I was careless!

I could have beaten him easily!

A-Awesome...!

That punk! There's no way I'm letting him reach his perfect form!

P-Piccolo? it couldn't be...

--Vegeta!
--D-Dad!

Start talking! What happened here?!

Tenshinhan appears to be headed this way, too.

Once he arrives, I'll tell the whole group.

Then I'd like to ask this much before then...

Are you really Piccolo?

How did you suddenly gain so much battle power?

Why, you...!

P-Piccolo-san...

Piccolo-san apparently remerged with Kami-sama.

W-What? Merged?

Th-That's all? The battle power I felt earlier definitely surpassed my own as a Super Saiyan.

Impossible! He's just a Namekian!

He's here! it's Tenshinhan!

What do we do? With No.17 and No.18, and now No.16, as well, one thing's for sure-- regardless of how much super power I've gained, they're still too much for me.

The only thing we can do is defeat Cell himself.

Um, Piccolo-- or rather, Kami-sama-- or rather... um...

W-What am I supposed to call you?
Tenshinhan is here.

All right, I'll tell you everything.

Vegeta and Tenshinhan, you didn't see him, but that monster earlier was an Artificial Human, created independently by the computer that Doctor Gero used.

What?!

Sure enough, I think I'll drop in on the town, and take every last one of its residents.

No-Oh, man...!

Cells from me and Kakarrot?

And there you have it.

In order to prevent Cell from reaching his perfect form, we either have to somehow find him and kill him, or find No.17 and No.18 and kill them.

It's either one or the other.

For my part, I think our only option is to defeat Cell while he still doesn't have all that much power.

Th-They're yanking my chain!

One after another, everyone is leaving the Super Saiyans in the dust like it was nothing!

It's maddening, huh, Kakarrot?

There they are-- humans!

Just you wait, No.17 and No.18.

In a few more days, once my power is far greater than yours, I'll be along to absorb you!


Attack the Elusive Cell! Son Goku, Finally Revived!"   



And there you have it.

He came from the future in order to combine with No.17 and No.18 and attain his perfect form.

A-Aw, man...

So, we somehow have to find that Cell guy, and take him out.

Will we be able to find him?

He knows about Piccolo-san's unexpectedly high strength, so he'll go on attacking people, with his Ki under wraps, won't he?

Tch, we have to keep Cell from combining with No.17 and No.18, or we'll have a real problem.

And not just the Earth.

This will also spell trouble for the other worlds in the universe.

Don't forget, he carries the blood of Freeza and his father, as well.

And my blood, as well.

You always favor the small-minded strategy.

If he wants to combine with them, let him.

It will leave me with fewer opponents to deal with.

I don't care what becomes of my enemy! I'll just kill them!

Don't take him too lightly, Vegeta.

If he combines with No.17 and No.18, against whom we were powerless, he will become much stronger than even they are.

Don't you get patronizing with me!

Do you want me to do away with you before the Artificial Humans?!

Hmph, I guarantee you, I will surpass everything.

I'll go beyond being even a Super Saiyan.

Go beyond being even a Super Saiyan?

Kakarrot will probably try to do the same. Count on it.

Hmph, I'll do things my own way.

You guys do whatever you're going to do on your own.

Go beyond being a Super Saiyan?

Does he mean it? Is such a thing even possible?

Listen, Trunks...it won't do any good to go back in time just a little bit, and destroy No.17 and the others?

No. Even if it might work for the future of that dimension, it wouldn't affect this one.

Then, it wouldn't do any good to go to Doctor Gero's laboratory, and destroy the still-incomplete Cell now, right?

No, let's destroy him anyway.

At least Cell will never be born in this dimension's future.

All right, you guys go to the laboratory.

I'm going to search around this area a little more.

--Right.
--I'm staying here, too.

Mm-hmm.

Okay then, if you aren't able to locate Cell, please come to the Kame House.

If we keep an eye on the TV news, we might be able to find out his location.

All right, we will.

Okay.

Go beyond being even a Super Saiyan?

I've never even thought of such a thing.

I'll bet not. But then, it might be possible, knowing Vegeta and Goku.

No doubt about it, this is Cell's work.

Sure enough, he's planning to attack other people, and gradually store up their bioenergy.

This didn't happen that long ago. 
He must still be in the area.

Let's look around.

It's so cold!

So then, is there actually anything under the laboratory?

How are we supposed to find it?

Kuririn-san, would you please give me a little room?

Kuririn-san...

What is it?

Kuririn-san, this is probably it.

You're right.

Come on, let's go have a look.

All right.

Damn it, is that the computer?!

Kuririn-san, please look at this.

I'm sure that this is what will become Cell.

Trunks, let's hurry up and destroy this whole underground lab!

J-Just a moment, please.

They're blueprints.

What are they blueprints for? Are they for Cell?

No, it says "No. " here.

No.17 ?

They're his, huh?

I-If we have my mom take a look at these, she might be able to figure out a weakness in No.17, Kuririn-san!

Yeah, that's a great idea!

Hey, are there any others there? Like for Cell?

Well... there doesn't seem to be anything else useful here.

All right, then, let's destroy this whole underground lab!

Right!

Those of us in the future were made to suffer because of this thing!

Take this!

Kuririn-san, let's hurry and get out of here.

All right!

Now to finish the job, damn you!

We did it, Trunks!

Finding No.17 's blueprints was an unexpected bonus, huh?

Yes.

Um, Kuririn-san...

Would you mind taking these blueprints to my mom?

Huh? You're not coming along?

I'm... thinking of training along with my dad.

If one is actually able to go beyond being a Super Saiyan, then I...

That's fine, and I don't want to say anything bad about your old man, but I don't think Vegeta is going to let you do that.

Yeah... And I don't especially want to do it, myself...

But my dad must also know that training with someone to match up against will produce much faster results than training alone.

All right, you got it.

You go train hard, now.

If you please...

--Good luck.
--Right.

Over there.

There's a disturbance of Ki over there, slight though it may be.

Down in that town!

Damn, we're too late. He's a speedy one.

We can't do anything like this.

Cell can sense our Ki, and runs away in a hurry.

If we suppress our Ki, we can't get there fast enough.

It's no use, it's no use. While they're dawdling around down there, I think I'll be off to find my next meal.

So what you're saying is, using these blueprints, find some weakness in No.17 and prevent Cell from combining with them, right?

This is amazing.

There is a lot of stuff here that not even I understand.

What a shame. 
If Doctor Gero had used his genius in some better way, the world would still be at peace.

Wow. Using a human base, he's converted nearly everything with organics.

If this is right, he really might be able to unite with them on a cellular level.

I'll have to study this more closely before I'm sure, but these few small devices that they're using might turn out to be a weakness.

We'll look into this right away, Kuririn-kun.

Yes, please do.

--Sense anything?
--No.

I'm sure I sensed his Ki a little while ago, though.

Damn. No matter what, we can't let him reach his perfect form!

Hello? Is something the matter? Hello?

Sister!

Oh, Kuririn, huh?

I'm impressed that you'd find me here.

I was trying to take a shortcut to the Kame House, but now I've run into this terrible beast!

Um...

Thank you very much.

N-N-Not at all. Hurry and get out of here!

Right! Come on.

Thank you!

Works out better for me, anyhow.

I'll just start by taking your bioenergy.

Hurry and get aboard.

Okay, here we go!

Taiyo-ken!!

We made it!

Where is he?! Where did he go?!

Oh, no!

It looks like you're through.

Kuririn!

Those guys, huh?

He's masked his presence again!

Are you all right, Kuririn?

I'm saved!

I guarantee you, I will surpass everything.

I'll go beyond being even a Super Saiyan.

If Dad can go beyond being a Super Saiyan, then so can I!

Mom...

Hey... Aren't there any decent roads?

Hmph, this is more fun, isn't it?

No.16 , are we getting near Son Goku's house?

Yeah. it's right up ahead.

Geez, you two haven't a care in the world, huh?

It would be easier going if we did this, you know...

You see? Much better.

Aw, what did you do that for?
It's no fun at all now, you know.

You really are a strange one.

You still have quite a few of your human points left.

And so, two days went by, and then three.

The monster has now appeared in a large town in Section South.

We also have word that over half the town's population has already been killed.

Damn!

Now he's in the southern sections!

I know!

Gohan! You be careful!

If we approach this way, Cell won't detect us.

We've got him this time.

Let's defeat him, before he can combine with No.17 and No.18 and achieve his perfect form!

Yeah! As it stands now, we can do it!

That's right! We've got Piccolo-san along, who has merged with Kami-sama, and gotten much stronger!

Cell is a crafty one.

Even once we get close, we can't find him if he hides on us.

What was that? Are the Artificial Humans attackin'?!

Goku-sa! Huh?

Goku-sa? Huh?

Is something the matter?

--Goku-sa!
--Goku!

Okay, me too...

Goku-sa!

Chichi!

Goku-sa!

Sorry I kept you so worried.

It looks like my illness is completely cured now.

Are you sure you're all right?!

Yeah! See for yourself!

Goku-sa!

Come on, cut that out!

Whoops. I guess I overdid it a little, huh?

Goku-sa!

Sorry, sorry!

--Goku...
--Oh, Old-timer!

Are you over your illness?

Yeah. I'm fine now.

I heard what you were all saying while I was dreaming.

I've got a pretty good idea what's going on.

Looks like we're in a real mess of things again, huh?

Goku, you don't mean you're...

You've gotta be kiddin'!
You're thinkin' of fightin' already?

You'll die!

Don't worry. I ain't fighting yet.

If Vegeta can't beat them right now, neither can I.

That's why I'm thinking of upping my game, too.

Upping?

By going above being a Super Saiyan.


Surpass Super Saiyan! Now, Into the Room of Spirit and Time"   




Yeah. I'm going to go for something even higher than Super Saiyan.

G-Go for something even higher than Super Saiyan?

Is that even possible?

I ain't sure.

But I don't think we can beat these opponents unless I do something like that.

If I can't reach it after training for one year, I'll give up.

One year? if you take that long...it's all right.

There's a place where you can spend one year in a single day.

Chichi, I wanna take Gohan there with me, okay?

Y-You've...

You've... You've gotta be kiddin'!

Or so I'd tell you, but it'd be no use tryin' to stop you.

What choice do I have?
But as long as you're doin' this, make sure you get good and strong.

Chichi...

However, this time, when the fight against the Artificial Humans is over, I won't be havin' any more interference with Gohan's studies.

That's the wife of the strongest man in the world for you.

She's not just a Spartan mother after all.

She has forbearance, as well.

And I'm also goin' to put you to work, Goku-sa.

Thank you.

Nice mood.

Well, I'm off.

Oh, he vanished! Where did he go?

Goku-sa...

Haven't we reached the city he's in yet?

--No.
--We have to hurry, or he'll run off on us again!

Ah, if only Goku were here...

--Goku?!
--Yeah, if Goku were here...

Goku?

You know, with Goku's instantaneous Movement...

Father!

...with just a whoosh...

Yo!

Yeah, just like that. He could show up anywhere, and...

Yo, Kuririn!

Goku!

Goku! I missed you!

Goku, we've been waiting for you!
When did you wake up?

Are you all better now?

Yeah. I am a bit hungry, though.

Hungry, huh? That sounds like you, Goku.
You're really better, right?

Yeah. I'm fine now.

Father!

Kamiccolo-sama!

What?

Don't go merging our names, as well!
My base is mostly Piccolo.

Just call me Piccolo.

Oh, yeah? Well then, Piccolo...

What?

There ain't no way I can beat the Artificial Humans or this Cell guy the way I am now.

That's why I'm taking Gohan and going off to train.

In the place where we can do a year's worth of training in one day.

What was that?

I see. You're planning to go into the Room of Spirit and Time, right?

That makes sense. But nobody has ever lasted a year inside that room.

Way back when, it was all you could do to last a month.

I'm taking Vegeta and Trunks, as well.

They're sure to be able to withstand it.

Then hurry up and go, Goku.

Cell is killing people in a hurry, and amassing power in a hurry.

If he combines with No.17 and No.18 and attains his perfect form, we'll have a problem.

Yeah.

Right.

Goku, tell us...

Does having an enemy so much more powerful than Freeza showing up scare you?

Or are you happy about it?

Both!

He sure is laid-back, what with people getting killed and the Earth about to be destroyed.

This is great. it looks like Goku hasn't given up.

We've still got a little bit of hope in sight.

He might really be able to go beyond being a Super Saiyan.

Goku-san...

How did your special training go?

No good. Dad just treats me like I'm a nuisance.

When I ask him to train with me, he insists that I shut up and go away.

Far from training, all Dad has done for the past three days is stand there, doing nothing.

That's the Vegeta that I know.

It looks like he can dimly see being something past Super Saiyan.

You're bothering me, Kakarrot. Get lost.

Don't say that. I know a great place to train.

There's a room where you can do a year's worth of training in one day up at Kami-sama's temple.

Really?

Yeah. Come with us. it ain't like I'm asking you to train with me.

But only two people can go in the room at once.

There ain't much time, so you're gonna go in with Trunks.

Fine, but I get to go in first.

Okay.

Sure enough, Son Goku isn't here, and neither is anyone else.

He ran away.

I'll bet he did.

Do you know where he is?

I'm not sensing Son Goku's power on my radar.

But assuming he went to one of his friends' places, there's the Capsule Corporation, in Metro West, or Muten Roshi's islet.

I see. So which one is closest?

Muten Roshi's house.

Roughly , 50 kilometers southeast of here.

All right, let's go.

Good grief.

Understood. Come.

It has bath, toilet, food, and bed.

Good luck with training.

Kakarrot, why are you suggesting that I train?

My ultimate objective is you.
You do know that, right?

I probably ain't gonna be able to defeat this foe alone.

You must be sensing that, too.

You may end up regretting this.

This is the Room of Spirit and Time, is it?

Yes. Who first?

Vegeta and Trunks will go in first.

All right.

Enter.

Excuse us for going first, Goku-san.

Good luck, Trunks. You play nice with Vegeta.

G-Good luck in there.

It's hot. The air is thin, too.

And the gravity is many times heavier.

W-What is this?

It's all white space, with nothing else inside it!

It's incredibly huge. So this is where Goku-san felt squeamish, and couldn't last for more than a month.

Yes, this will do.

A whole year with Dad, in a place like this?

I thought we were finally going to get him this time!

Too much to hope for, huh? Damn.

He masked his Ki.

It's just no use. There are too many places where he can hide.

This is bad. He must be a lot stronger by now.

There's no telling when he's going to combine with No.17 and No.18 and achieve his perfect form.

The way things are going, all we can do is pray that Goku and the others really can go beyond being Super Saiyan, and then we can defeat No.17 and the others together.

Nearly a day had gone by since Vegeta and Trunks entered the Room of Spirit and Time.

This mysterious fiend continues to appear all over...

--Damn it, enough already, Cell!
--...and has already claimed the lives of tens of thousands.

The world continues each day to tremble in fear of this fiend, as we hope that these incidents come to a conclusion soon...

Blasted Cell!

Yo, is Son Goku here?

D-Damn, I don't know if this is good timing, or bad.

It doesn't appear that Son Goku is here.

Oh, no?

Get up! We've got the worst of all houseguests.

Huh? What? Who?

Get on out of here! Son Goku is not around!

So it seems. Then why don't you tell us where he is?

H-How did they know about this place?

Do you think we're just going to come out and tell you?

Well, I can't say.

If you don't tell us, I plan to force it out of you if I have to.

A-Are those the Artificial Humans we've heard about?

Hmph, you don't say.
All right then, go ahead and try.

There's an uninhabited island over there. That's where we'll do it.

Well, well, you'll never learn.

You guys keep away. You have to know that they're too much for you.

Hey, do you think he can win?

No way. There are three of them.

Two of the four in Goku's group should be finishing their training.

But until they do, it's up to you, Piccolo.

If you don't tell me anything, I will kill you this time. Understood?

Hmph, it won't be as easy for you as it was last time!

I have difficulty understanding why you would choose a fight that you can't win.

Are you buying time?

Or are you just a fool?

Well, if you're coming at me, then come on.

Will you be the only one fighting, No.17 ?

Of course. By all rights, I'm more than a match for the likes of you.

Good. If I'm only facing one of them, I might get somewhere.

If I can defeat either No.17 or No.18, I can also prevent Cell from reaching his perfect form.

Even as far away as we are, it feels like he's raising his Ki right in front of us.

A-Awesome.

I-Imagine, him being this strong.

No, this isn't the half of it.

Now that he's merged with Kami-sama, Piccolo can raise his Ki even higher.
He's just getting started.

H-He is?

K-Kami-sama...

it's started. Piccolo is the one fighting.

Is it Cell that he's fighting?

No, I ain't able to sense his opponent's Ki.

It's probably the Artificial Humans.

Oh, no! Piccolo-san is going to get killed!

Going there won't do any good, Gohan!

There's too much difference in your levels right now!

Do you wanna drag him down?!

Very soon, Vegeta and Trunks will be coming out, all powered-up!

Just wait until then!

Besides, right now, Piccolo is an unbelievably strong fighter!

Yes. Kami-sama and Piccolo not beaten so easily.

Mm-hmm.

Ain't you done yet, Vegeta?

Or is going beyond Super Saiyan impossible after all?

What's going on here?

That is not Piccolo!

What?!

Tch, what a pest!

You're not getting away!

What?!

Now you're getting carried away.

Super Piccolo is so strong!


This is the Power of a Super-Namekian! #17 vs. Piccolo!" 
  


♪ You're such a good little boy... ♪

♪ Now, off to sleep... ♪

He's finally asleep.

Oh, yeah? Good.

So, how is your shutdown device coming?

For crying out loud! What a contraption Doctor Gero has built!

There, there...

♪ You're such a good little boy... ♪

I want to cry, too.

Hmph, brace yourself, you thickheaded fool.

Take this!

How about this one?!

H-He bounced it away!

This is definitely a lot better than before.

You really are making this quite enjoyable.

He's playing around again.

He really hasn't grown up at all.

What's the matter? Done already?

Come on! Enough already!

No.17 , hurry up and finish him!

Or would you rather have me take over?

Don't be ridiculous!
This is the most fun I've had!

You think I'd switch with you?

Same goes for you, right?

Yes, it does.

There's more to the "greatest power ever" that I possess than just this.

Is there? Then show me.

Not this again! Try it all you like, it won't work.

I've given you too much credit!

Do you really think that technique is going to work against me?!

What are you aiming at?!

There's nowhere left for you to run!

Looks like it's the end of the road for the "strongest ever."

See you in hell!

W-What is this?!

A-A barrier?!

Too bad. So close, too.

Hmph, I'm just getting started!

Let's relocate. Someone went and destroyed the island, after all.

Hmph, you should be more careful with nature.

That fierce Ki belongs to Piccolo, merged with Kami-sama.

Who could he be fighting, with that much power?

It can only be No.17 and No.18!

I've found you! Good timing!

I'll be right there, just you wait.

My power is now greater than yours!

You have magnificent power, for not being an Artificial Human.

You do indeed appear to be someone other than Piccolo Daimao.

But then, I'm not really interested in who you are.

I just want to know where Son Goku is.

Do you still not want to tell me?

Your objective is to kill Goku.

There's no way I'm going to tell you where he is.

Then, shall we continue our fight?

Until you do want to tell me.

This time, I'm coming at you like I really mean it.

You've got pretty good speed.

But your punch has no force behind it.

What?!

You've got a pretty big mouth, don't you?

To say something like that to No.17, the strongest Artificial Human ever...

He really is strong. 

He's evenly matched against No.17.

Piccolo-san, hang in there!

Withstand him somehow, Piccolo...until Vegeta and Trunks finish their training.

Sheesh, how many islands are you going to destroy before you're happy?

A-Awesome... it looks like Piccolo is still hanging in there.

D-Damn it, is this the most that we can do?

How can this be?

I-Is something the matter?

H-He's coming closer... Now, of all times...!

C-Cell?

No-Oh, no...

I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

The day when I attain my perfect form!

Good grief.

What do we do, Kuririn?

Y-You're asking me?

If that Cell monster absorbs the Artificial Humans now, it will mean all of our hopes are dashed.

Damn!

Kuririn, there's a phone call from Bulma. Come take it.

She said somethin' about havin' found the Artificial Humans' weakness.

She what?!

That's right!

No.17 and No.18 both have an emergency shutdown circuit incorporated into their bodies.

If we can stop them from moving, then even if they are Artificial Humans, we can easily destroy them, right?

Yes, I just completed a controller which will do that!

Hey, can we beat the Artificial Humans?

Begging your pardon, but could you bring it to us right away?

Right now, Piccolo-san is fighting the Artificial Humans.

Sure, I'll be right there.

Terrific. if we can destroy the Artificial Humans, Cell can't reach his perfect form.

Destroy... them...?

What?

N-N-Nothing...

F-Father, Cell has...
Cell has started making his move!

Yeah, I know.

Ain't they done yet? Vegeta is a gifted fighter.

He should have broken through the Super Saiyan barrier long ago.

Hurry it up, Vegeta, before there's no way to undo the damage.

Our powers may be even, but it looks like the difference in our stamina is starting to show.

My energy will never run out.

C-Cell!


Run #17! Piccolo, A Battle for Suicidal Resistance" 
  
D-Damn! 
I was so wrapped up in the battle, I didn't notice him! 

Who is that strange-looking guy? 

W -What? He doesn't know? No.17 and the others don't know about Cell! 

The momentous day is finally here. The day when I merge with No.17 and No.18 and gain my perfect form. 

No.17 ... No.18 ...Who is that one? 
Judging by his Red Ribbon Army mark, I believe he is also one of Doctor Gero's Artificial Humans. 
Well, in any case, he is a prior model. 
I should be able to ignore him. 
What will it be, Piccolo? 
If you wish to interfere, then by all means, come at me. 

I can't believe you've powered up that much. 
Just how many lives did you sacrifice?! 

Sacrifice? 
Hmph, absurd. 
It is more like an honor to become part of my power. 

What?! 
How can this be? 
Cell's Ki has risen to an unbelievable level! 
It's all over now. 
We're powerless. 
There's nothing we can do! 
As fast as Bulma might be bringing the controller that can stop No.17 and the others, it will still take another minutes before she arrives. 

Then you should go and get that controller thing from her. You'll get it sooner than you will just waitin' around here. Y-You're right! 

You guys are all so dense. That's because fightin' is all you do. 

I'm gonna go fly there and get it from her! 
If I fly all-out, I'm sure I'll be faster than Bulma-san's plane. 

Krillin...

I'm going to go help Piccolo!

I might not be able to do anything, but it's better than staying here doing nothing!

Stop! Tenshinhan! Come back!

Does he want to die for nothing?!

Confound it, there's not a damn thing I can do now.

I miss the days of being Muten Roshi, greatest in the whole world.

Goku, finish your training and come back soon.

You may be able to do a whole year's training in just one day, but right now, that one day is too long.

Goku-sa... Gohan-chan...

Ain't you done yet, Vegeta?

I don't know who you are, but you're interrupting.

Go on, get lost. Right now, I'm playing with him.

No.17 ! He plans to kill you and absorb you into himself!

--Get out of here!
--What?!

A surprise attack? Get real.

What do you mean?
That monster wants to absorb me?

I'll keep it simple. That is a monster that Doctor Gero's computer created, named Cell.

He still is unfinished, but says he will be complete once he assimilates you and No.18.

What was that?

Rejoice, my brethren.
By becoming one with my body, the perfect superbeing, with power beyond all others, will be born.

Such will be the ultimate warrior that Doctor Gero sought after for so many years.

That's enough of your bullcrap!

You expect me to be assimilated into you?

The ultimate warrior is already right here!

Your volition is of no matter.

Your assimilation is already certain.

I'm going to shut that annoying mouth of yours.

Get out of there, No.17 !

The enemy's battle power is far too great!

He cannot be allowed to reach his perfect form.

His objective is no longer the death of Son Goku.

He plans to destroy the entire universe!

Well, well...

Here you finally opened up to talk seriously to us, and you tell me to run away?

Don't you... Don't you mock me!

Damn it!

Die!

Damn it...

Are No.17 and that guy a lot like Piccolo holding back?

No, they aren't. That guy Cell is just too strong for them.

You, at least, should get away, No.18.

No.17 won't heed my warnings.

If you two are absorbed, he will be beyond anyone's control.

It will be the end of the world.

What are you going to do, No.16 ?

See you in hell!

Yikes!

He's gone! Piccolo got him!

No, he isn't. In fact, he hasn't even taken any damage.

H-How can that be? There's nothing we can do.

He's in a whole different world from us!

Run, No. !

His neck is broken! This is bad!

It appears that I've gone and become too strong.

I got too eager, and killed more people and took more energy than I needed to.

Bye, now.

H-He did him in!

His Ki is gone...

We weren't in time...

Kami-sama...

Gohan...

Wait, Gohan!

Piccolo-san is... Piccolo-san is...

--Gohan! if you go there now, you can't defeat him!
--Piccolo-san is...

Wait!

Right now, all we can do is wait!

Ain't you done yet, Vegeta?

What are you doing?!

Ah! Trunks!

Don't touch that. This is something very important, okay?

Uh-oh, not good.

No crying, now, Trunks.

Trunks, why don't we ask, "Hello, who is it?" on here?

Okay? That will be fun.

Let's see, I wonder who will answer.

Maybe that dirty old Turtle Hermit.

Or maybe that bald-headed Kuririn.

Hello, this is Bulma. Is someone there?

Oh, it's you, Bulma.

You see? He answered.

Bulma, can you see Kuririn from where you are?

Huh? Kuririn?

I don't see him.

No, huh? As it happens, Kuririn is headed your way right now.

Oh, he is? That will let me hand over the controller sooner, and saves me some trouble, too.

Yeah, and we don't have a moment to lose.

If we don't stop No.17 and No.18 soon, they're going to be assimilated by Cell, and it will be the end of everything.

Yeah. I'll watch out to make sure I don't miss Kuririn.

All right, Trunks, let's fly at super-speed!

He may have merged with Kami, but he was still no match for my powered-up self.

I can't wait anymore! I don't want to wait!

Father, I'm going!

W-Why?

I told you to wait!

But as it stands, everyone will become casualties of Cell!

Gohan...

Your father right.

Popo-san...

if you go now, can't beat Cell.
Just add one more casualty.

Even so... Even so, it's better than just sitting here, doing nothing, while everyone is getting killed.

You Saiyans last remaining hope in the world to defeat Cell.

If such important life wasted, Kami-sama-- no, even Piccolo get mad.

Look.

Vegeta...

Hurry and get out here!

Sorry to keep you waiting.

Don't put up any futile resistance.

You are going to be absorbed in any event, so there is no reason to make it painful.

I will be coming for you shortly.

It's a tight pinch!

What are you to do, faced with such overwhelming power, Artificial Humans?


Unmeasured Power! The Silent Warrior #16, Makes his Move"   


You monster!

I am not about to be assimilated!

What's the matter?

I thought you weren't going to be beaten so easily.

Like I said, don't put up any futile resistance.

It does indeed look like I should get away, huh?

Yeah, you should. Get away by yourself.

If both you and No.18 get absorbed, that will be when the world ends.

What are you going to do?

Destroy Cell.

The time for me to fight has come, before encountering Son Goku.

What are you doing, No.16 ?!

Stop! You'll be killed!

You guys are fine folks.

You didn't unnecessarily take the lives of people or animals.

I enjoyed traveling with you.

What does he plan to do?
Is he planning to fight Cell?

Why don't you let me absorb you now?

L-Let go of me, you hideous monstrosity!

Looking at your squashed-up wormy face makes me wanna puke!

Spout whatever you like.

You are about to become one with this "monstrosity."

Damn it...!

I will have you now.

Damn you... monster...!

So, another daredevil fool comes forward.

What are you doing, No.16 ?
Don't tell me you mean to fight him.

There is no other way.

A-Are you trying to get yourself killed?

By my calculation, Cell and I have just about equal power.

What?

Ha! That was too easy!

Now then, to start absorbing...

Y-You're...

Damn! You're completely robotic?!

H-He's done it!

You won't be able to assimilate
No.17 and No.18 now.

Aw, too bad.

I have Piccolo's cells included within me.

I can regenerate something as minor as that.

So to prevent you from reaching your perfect form, I'm going to have to crush the life right out of you.

That will be quite impossible.

We'll never know unless I try.

Oh, yes we will.

Hell's Flash!!

What an incredible blast! What is happening?

It's not Piccolo. His Ki disappeared a little while ago.

Is it Cell? Or maybe No.17 ?

F-Father...

Yeah, I felt it too.

C-Cell's Ki is suddenly a lot lower.

I don't know who that is, but keep it up!

U-Unbelievable.

Th-This is how strong No.16 really is?

A-Amazing.

Are you still here?
I told you to run away, No.17 !

It doesn't matter now, does it?
You took care of him.

I have not defeated him!
He may have taken some damage, but it will take more than that to kill someone like him!

No.18, now's your chance! You run away, too!

Run away?

You've got to be kidding!
After the pain he put me through?

I am not about to run away without getting my licks in!

He has taken damage, right?

Then I will finish him off myself.

Come on out, you monstrosity!

What's the matter?! I thought you were going to assimilate me!

I'm not going to run and hide!

Not until I've choked the life out of you!

No.17! Behind you! it's Cell!

I've come on out, just as you asked!

Stop! You monstrosity!

Oh, no!

H-He swallowed him!

Run, No.18 !

What are you waiting for?! Run!

You should get out of here, too!

That Cell guy's Ki is swelling up extraordinarily.

This ain't good. it looks like either No.17 or No.18 got assimilated.

Come on! We're getting away, No.18!

W-What speed!

This is bad.

This is very bad.

Did you think you could get away from me?

Forgive me, Chaozu. This just might kill me.

I'm impressed at my magnificent speed myself.

Naturally, it is a result of absorbing No.17.

I wonder what my power is like now...

Ho, that appears to have risen considerably, as well.

Now, then...

That will do.

You're smart enough to realize that trying to run away would be a complete waste of effort.

Now, it is your turn.

Let us create my perfect form together.

I dare you to come any closer.
I will personally destroy myself.

You can't have me dying on you, right?

Can you hear my voice, No.18? it's me, No.17.

I have just become one with Cell.

It's a terrific sensation. it's wonderful!

You should get yourself assimilated right away.

Just by doing that, we can become the ultimate life form!

N-No. ...

D-Don't be fooled, No.18 !

That's Cell! He's just using No.17's voice!

Nobody asked you! Keep quiet!
A robot has no idea how we feel!

Now, No. , there is no need to waver.

Join with us now, and obtain the greatest of powers!

Then we can carry on Doctor Gero-sama's wishes...defeat Son Goku, and have the world in the palm of our hands!

You are not No.17!

We hated Doctor Gero for converting us as he pleased!

He would never say "Doctor Gero-sama"!

If that's how you want it, I will absorb you by force if I have to.

Do not offer any futile resistance.

I'm sure it takes a brief instant to store up enough for you to launch an energy blast.

It should be possible for me to move faster than that to prevent you from killing yourself.

Give up.

D-Damn...

You little guppy! What do you think you can do?

Shin Kiko-ho!!

That Ki...!

It's Tenshinhan-san's Ki!

Don't tell me Tenshinhan is taking on Cell!

What are you waiting for?!
Get out of here, now!

Why, you...!


Tenshinhan's Do-or-Die Shin Kikoho! Save Your Brother-in-Arms, Son Goku" 
  



T-Tenshinhan-san is hanging tough, but his Ki is dropping quickly.

Tenshinhan's Shin Kiko-ho uses fair amount of energy.

Even so, all he can do to stop Cell's movements.

At this rate...

S-Stop, Tenshinhan!
Don't use the Kiko-ho any more!

--Can you fly?
--Yeah, more or less.

Come on, now's our chance.

Let's go, No.18!

Y-You won't get away!

Why, you...

Stop it, already! Stop, Tenshinhan!

If you use the Kiko-ho any further, it's gonna kill you!

When I say stop, I mean it!

T-Ten-san...

Damn, she got away.

You can't move, huh?

Who would have thought that someone like you would get in my way?

T-Tenshinhan-san...

D-Damn it...

if I just left you there, you'd die anyway...but I'll still kill you.

W-What?

So you're Cell, are you?

Son Goku...

You look to be one out-of-this-world monster.

H-How did he just appear?

I'd like to settle things right here, but in my present state, there ain't a chance in the world that I can beat you.

But just you wait one day!

I swear, I'll mop the floor with you!

Of all the nonsense to come out of your mouth!

In one more day, you're going to defeat me?

--That's right!
--What can you hope to do in just one day? Eh?

It's Piccolo's Ki!

Piccolo is still alive!

What?

Tenshinhan, you stick with me!

Wha--?

Ah, there he is!

Hey! Piccolo! Stay with me!

H-How did they both just move?

In that brief instant...

Piccolo, Tenshinhan, you're both gonna be fine.

When we get back to Kami-sama's palace, there'll be Karin-sama's senzu beans.

You're thinking of escaping?
I won't allow that, Son Goku.

H-He's gone.

An odd technique. Son Goku, when did you learn that move?

It doesn't matter right now.
I have to catch No.18.

She's together with the damaged No.16, so she couldn't have gotten too far away.

Ah, it's Bulma-san!

Huh? What is it, Trunks?

B-Burin... Buburin...

Huh? Kuririn? Where? Where is he?

Hey!

You were right!

Way to go, Trunks! Nicely spotted!

You really are a genius.

Just what you'd expect from a child of mine.

Bulma-san!

Bulma-san, please give me the controller to shut down the Artificial Humans, right away!

Yes, I know.

Here.

Wow, this is the controller, huh?

But you have to be within ten meters when you use it, or it won't have any effect.
Don't forget that, okay?

Ten meters?

Th-That's pretty close, huh?

Even so, I worked my heinie off to make it!

I-I know.

I'll use it with care.

Let's see, also...

I took the battle wear that Vegeta asked for and had the same kind made up for everyone.

Will you take them with you while you're at it?

They're light, and extremely tough.

Goku and the others are the ones who need those.

They're up at Kami-sama's palace right now.

Bulma-san, could you deliver them there, please?

Kami-sama's palace? That's way up above Karin Tower, right?

Yes, that's right.

Sure, I'll take them there.

Meanwhile, Kuririn, good luck destroying those Artificial Humans.

R-Right.

Okay, let's zip on over to Kami-sama's palace!

B-Buburin, bye-bye.

I've gotta say, Tenshinhan, that was a crazy thing to do!

I was really worried about you, too.

But Tenshinhan-san, thanks to you, No.18 got away without being assimilated by Cell. 
That's great!

Still, that monster Cell has an unnatural amount of strength.

Frankly, no one will be able to beat him.

Not even Vegeta, and not even Goku.
That's what I believe.

Hey!

Goku! Vegeta and Trunks soon coming out of room!

Really?

I'm terribly sorry to have kept you waiting.

Trunks-san!

We really have been waiting.

Dad appeared to surpass the Super Saiyan boundary about two months after we went inside.

He still did not seem satisfied with that, and so the rest of the time up to now--

Trunks...

Nobody asked you.

Hmph, it looks like it went well in there, Vegeta.

Perhaps.

But then, you're wasting your time if you go inside and train now.

That's because I'm going to take care of all of them--Cell and the Artificial Humans.

What?!

Vegeta, I don't know how strong you might have become, but you give them too little credit.

While you were inside that room, Cell assimilated Artificial Human No.17 and got even stronger!

His strength is astonishing.

Vegeta, I went and had just a glimpse of the advanced Cell, and he was an unbelievable monster.

Ah, there it is!

Hmm? What's that?

--Huh?
--What was that? What was that?
What was that?!

Looks like he's upset about something.

Oh, well.

Wow! So this is Kami-sama's temple, huh?

Hey, guys?

Where are you? Come on out if you're here.

That's Bulma-san's voice.

Ah, there they are.

Bulma, what are you doing here?

Kuririn told me you guys were all here.

Hello there.

Huh?

Hey, hold on, you're Trunks, aren't you? isn't that right?

--Y-Yes...
--Why is your hairstyle different? Is that a wig?

Oh, and you're taller, aren't you?

Here in Kami-sama's temple, there's a mystical room, where one year inside is the same as a single day on the outside.

I trained with Dad inside that room.

Huh? Say, Vegeta's hair hasn't grown at all, considering.

A pure Saiyan's hair stays the way it was when they were born; It doesn't go through any weird changes.

Is that right? Then no wonder mine's like that, too.

You never noticed before now?

Nah. I did think it was a little strange, though.

Oh, for heaven's sake.

This is no time to be discussing something so unimportant.

Just why are you here, Bulma?

Oh, right, right, I forgot.

Here. it's the battle wear that Vegeta asked me to make.

Its defensive strength is incredibly high, you know.

So I went ahead and had them made for everyone, and brought them here.

Wow, this brings back memories.

These are the clothes I wore on Planet Namek.

Wow, this is lighter than it looks.

It was a real effort to duplicate the material they're made from.

That's our Bulma-san!

Oh, dear, you flatter me.

Huh? Aren't you going to put yours on?

I don't care to wear the same clothing as Freeza and the Saiyans.

Nor do I.

I'll die before wearing the same outfit as Vegeta.

Don't be so fussy.

This is pretty easy to move around in.

Like I said before, Kakarrot, it won't do you any good to wear that.

You won't play any part in this.

Because you're going to defeat that monster Cell, right?

That would be better than anything.

Well, I guess I'll go defeat Cell, then.

I'll take you to him, using my instantaneous Movement.

Don't be ridiculous. I don't need any help from you.

Bye, now.

My, my, he's as bull-headed as ever.

Well, I'll be going, too.

Yeah. Oh, just a sec...

These senzu are for you and Vegeta.
Take them with you.

Thank you very much.

Good luck. But don't get in over your head.

If it gets dicey, get out of there right away. Got it?

Yes. Thank you for everything.

Goku-san, good luck in your training, as well.

Don't either of you two go dying, now.

Understood?

All right, Gohan. Now it's our turn for some father-son training.

Right!

Damn that No.18. Where did she disappear to?

She's together with the injured No.16.
She can't have gone too far.

Given No.18's speed, I must have overtaken her by now.

Since I can't see them, it would appear that they are hiding on one of these islands.

Very well.

Do you hear me, No.18?!

Show yourself!

Show yourself, or I will destroy these islands one by one!

This is no bluff!

You might think that I won't do it, since I won't be able to reach my perfect form if I end up destroying you!

I'm afraid not! it's true, I do want to reach my perfect form, but as I am now, I am already without peer in this world!

I know you can hear me, No.18!

Come on out immediately!

W-What is with that enormous voice?

I-It sounds like it's coming from the sky, far away from here.

Listen up! No.18!

If you don't come out, I will destroy all of these islands!

You got that?!

Damn that freak.

It's all right, No.18. Don't move.

He may say that, but he won't actually destroy anything.

He's quite fixed on reaching his perfect form.

No.18...You won't show yourself, huh?

You're going to make me go through with it. 
Fool.

Well then, I'll start by flushing you out from that island.

Hey, isn't that where the loud voice is coming from?

W-Why is he hovering in the sky?

I-I-It's the devil.

Looks like Cell has gone into action with a bang.


Super Saiyan Surpassed! The Daring Vegeta Strikes Cell"   



Whoa!

Geez, you really are too easygoing.

Okay, it now your turn to enter.
I wonder how long you last.

E-Everything is all white.

M-My body feels heavy, and it's hot and stuffy.

Once the door to the room is closed, all contact from the outside world is completely shut out.

See? You ain't able to feel Cell's Ki or Vegeta's Ki anymore, right?

Oh, you're right. I don't sense anything.

Yep.

The tub and toilet are over there.

This is our food storage.
There's a year's worth of food in there.

What do you think?

Well, even with as much as you eat, Father, we'll be fine.

Yeah.

Gohan, we've got all the basics.

Right. I should be able to make it through like this.

Oh, yeah? Go look out back.
You'll understand the reason why it was too hard for me to stay here for even a month when I was a kid.

What's going on here?

We're inside a room, but it's so spread-out!

And there's nothing here!

Apparently, it's as big as the whole Earth.

Oh, man!

It would appear that No.18 was not on that island.

Well then, on to the next island.

No.18! Are you still not going to show yourself?!

Soon, the island you're hiding on will be obliterated, along with you!

She didn't come forward, huh?
She has to be on one of these islands.

She has to know that it won't do any good to make an undersea escape, either.

Either way, I have little choice but to search the entire sea around here.

Is that all the battle power Cell has?

What were Kakarrot and the others so frightened of?

Damn.

He's finally come to the next island over!

Calm down.

Cell is only looking for things moving away from the island.

Just sit tight here and don't move.

You, at least, will definitely survive.

There's only one island remaining.

Only one more.

He's coming!

Calm down. Don't give up before it's over.

If you are assimilated, it's the end of everything.

You can come on out now, No.18.

You're... Vegeta!

You're Cell, are you? On the ground.

Vegeta?

What have you come all this way for?

I don't suppose you're here to tell jokes, such as that you've come to defeat me, have you?

I didn't come to defeat you.

I'm going to take you apart until there's no trace of you left.

You? Beat me?

This should be good.

It's shocking that my cells would be used to make a hideous monster like you.

I would have expected you to turn out a little better.

They were used to create me, the mightiest being in the universe.

You should consider that an honor.

Hmph, you're wrong, monster.

You are not the mightiest being in the universe.

That would be me, Vegeta, the Saiyan prince.

He's a fool.

What can a man who was powerless against me hope to do against Cell now?

Trunks?

You seem quite a bit different.

Well, no matter how many of you I take on, it makes no difference.

If you like, I can wait until more of you arrive.

He's here merely as a spectator.

I can more than handle burying you all on my own.

What? Did you say you could more than handle me on your own?

That's right. Got a problem with that?

No problem.

I'm just stunned by the ridiculousness of it.

Cell is right. Under no circumstances can Vegeta beat him.

But No.16, this might be a chance for us to get away.

Right, No.16?

Wait. We'll move once the battle gets started.

But never mind that-- this is strange.

Vegeta's battle power is quite a bit higher than it was during that fight earlier.

It couldn't be.

There's no way it could change that much in this short a time.

It didn't look like he was holding back, either.

Watch very closely, Cell.

I'm going to wipe that revolting smirk right off your face.

Dad is planning to turn right off the bat...into that.

It's starting. His Ki is rapidly...rapidly growing larger.

H-His Ki is tremendous.

Let's have a look, Vegeta, at this power beyond Super Saiyan.

What is that?

I can't believe that Vegeta had that kind of power!

Y-You mean, it's still increasing?!

What is this?

Without a doubt, he has gone beyond Super Saiyan.

What's the matter? Did I catch you napping, or something?

The fruits of our training.

Cell isn't quite able to follow Dad's movements.

I didn't see how Vegeta moved.

Take this more seriously, Cell.

You do seem somewhat capable.

Is all this the result of training in that room?

So that's it! This incredible Ki belongs to Vegeta.

It's even greater than Cell's ridiculously huge Ki.

What's going on?

Oh, right, that deal Goku mentioned about being able to do a year's training in one day.

Let's go see.

Be careful.

If you go too far away from here, you may not find your way back, and end up dying out there.

Right.

The temperature varies from 100° down to minus 30°.

The air here is about a quarter of what it is on Earth, and the gravity is ten times greater in this bleak, white world.

It's a big deal.

A-A whole... A whole year, in a place like this?

Gohan, let's start training, right away.

We ain't here for the fun of it.

Well? Pretty incredible, huh?

This is your first time doing gravity training, huh?

Well, you'll get used to it soon.

Right.

First, Gohan, we're gonna make you a Super Saiyan.

Super Saiyan?

--Yeah.
--You think I'll be able to turn Super Saiyan?

Of course. You've inherited honest-to-goodness Saiyan blood.

For now, we've gotta get you to become Super Saiyan.

We'll start our actual training after that.

But Father, won't I be getting in the way of your training?

Yeah, at first.

Then again, Gohan, once you turn Super Saiyan, you'll be a lot more help to me as a sparring partner.

You are my son. Have faith in yourself. Got it?

--Right.
--Okay.

Naturally, I intend to gain power beyond Super Saiyan.

I want to be stronger than anyone else, after all.

But Gohan, I'm planning to make you even stronger than me.

Huh? Me, stronger than you, Father?

That's right. That's my dream.

I'm convinced that it will definitely happen.

I'm not so sure.

Trunks-san said that in the future, I was a Super Saiyan, and I was still killed by the Artificial Humans.

What are you talking about?

Trunks' future has already been changed dramatically, right?

And I'm still alive and kicking, too.

Besides, when you get killed in the future, you hadn't gone through training in here, right?

You're right.

It all depends on your resolve.

Father, if you please!

All right, that's the spirit.

I'm gonna be a lot tougher on you than Piccolo was, okay?

Brace yourself.

Right!

What's the matter? Through already?

That's right! it's all over!

Your life, that is!

I haven't yet started showing you hell.

I can't wait to see it.

That was hell?

It looks like you want me to take the gloves off.

I thought you already had your gloves off...but if that's not the case, don't hold anything back.

Ho... That's quite a leap in your battle power.

But then, so what?

Dad has him beat.

That really is all you've got, huh?

It looks like my training has opened up too wide a gap between us.

Impossible... You are Vegeta, aren't you? Am I wrong?

I am Super Vegeta.

He has the confidence and ability to proclaim himself "Super Vegeta."


The Surging Resentment of Cell! Kuririn, Destroy #18"   



No, no, all you're doing is making your Ki expand.

Becoming a Super Saiyan is first triggered by anger.

Get mad. Let yourself snap.

I can't get angry just because you tell me to.

I know. imagine that me, or Piccolo, or Kuririn is about to get killed by Cell.

But I've never seen Cell.

Then, make it Freeza, or anyone else you want.

Right.

I can't.

You can't expect to turn that easily right off the bat.

There ain't no hurry.

It's Vegeta. And that's Cell, huh?

Monsters, both of them.

Super Vegeta, you say? What is that?

It's too much trouble to spell it out for you. 
Use your imagination.

You blow your own horn with that "Super Vegeta" business, but in the future, you're killed by No.17!

I have absorbed the power of No.17 now!

Even a child would know which one of us is stronger!

Hmph, when they say the weaker the dog, the more it barks, this is what they mean.

If you've got time to continue that pretense, maybe you should start worrying about yourself.

As hopeless as that might be now.

Cell is a lot different than he was before.

I-Is that the perfect form he mentioned?

Has he already gotten No.18 and...?

After all the trouble Bulma-san went through to make this, it's not going to do us any good.

I have your cells within me, as well.

Take this!

I would expect nothing less of someone who had obtained my cells.

But while you may be able to imitate my Gyallic-Ho, the difference in our power levels is something beyond your control.

I-I am not going to just let this happen!

Impossible!

How can this be?!

Awesome! His strength is ridiculous now!

H-His body is larger, too.
So that's the new Vegeta, is it?

I-Is that...Trunks?

He's gotten a lot brawnier.
I almost didn't recognize him.

H-How can this be? He was never supposed to be able to take me on.

What the hell happened? How does Vegeta have that kind of power?

Damn...

Th-This can't...

Th-Th-This can't possibly be happening.

I won't let something this absurd happen!

Take this!

Looks like you've received quite a shock, Cell.

You want me to lay yet another shocking fact on you?

There's a guy named Trunks over there.

He has not as much, but close to the same level of power that I do.

It would appear that even with all the power you can muster, that's the best that you can do.

You disappoint me! This is anticlimactic.

After wondering how hardcore you had to be...

And now killing you has become a frivolous chore.

Damn it all!!

I-Incredible...!

Damn it all!!

Damn... it... all!

Damn it all!

Damn it all!!

Gohan! Get mad! Let yourself snap!

Let yourself snap!

When did I fall asleep?

Father...

Ka...me...ha...me...Ha!!

Father!

Gohan, you're awake?

Father, I'm embarrassed to have fallen asleep.

Gohan, the gravity is ten times normal.

During the day, it's 100°, and at night, it's minus 30°.

We've got to train for a whole year under these extreme conditions.

That's got to be hard on a child like you.

You can rest when you have to.

I-I've rested plenty. Father, please train me.

Please, I want to hurry up and become a Super Saiyan, like you.

When I first came here, I didn't have the heart that you do.

Gohan, let's do it!

R-Right!

Damn it all!

I-If only... if only I could achieve my perfect form, that guy would be nothing!

Damn it, No.18, where are you?!

No.18? She's here?

N-No. is in the area?

I-I can still use this controller.

But where exactly is she?

I have to find No.18 now, while I still can.

I-If only I could achieve my perfect form...if only I could achieve my perfect form, that guy would be nothing!

What's this, then?

Are you saying that once you reach your perfect form, you can't be beaten by me?

That's right! There's no way I can lose!

Power, speed, moves, brains, nerves--

I will become the perfect being in all aspects!

That's what the computer said.

Damn it...

if only I could achieve my perfect form...

Damn it all!

Amazing.

Could he have intentionally acted weaker when we fought?

No.18 There would have been no reason for him to do that.

Something has happened in these last few days.

S-Something happened?

What exactly could have happened to make him change that much?!

Th-There she is! Right here!

D-Do they not realize it? Not Cell...

Not Vegeta...

Not Trunks?

Once I use this to immobilize No.18, and then destroy her, Cell won't be able to become his perfect form, and No.18 will be defeated.

But you have to be within ten meters when you use it, or it won't have any effect.
Be careful. 
Within ten meters.
All right...

if only I could assimilate No.18...

The male one, No.17, isn't around.

Was he the only one absorbed?

I'll bet that's how Cell powered up and transformed.

Th-There they are!

I have to somehow get within ten meters of them, without them realizing it.

If they see me, it's all over.

At a critical time like this, what am I thinking?!

Holy cow, don't scare me like that!

You idiot! The Artificial Humans are over there!

As manifest as the difference is between us, you're saying that if you were to reach your perfect form, you would be able to beat me?

Without a doubt, I could beat you, if that's all you've got.

Ho...

D-Dad, you're not thinking...

You appear to be thinking it over.

Well? Vegeta, you Saiyans are a dyed-in-the-wool warrior race.

You love to fight.

What's more, the stronger your opponent, the more you relish the battle.

Isn't that true? Am I wrong?

You want to fight me in my perfect form, don't you?

You have to want to fight me.

You are the prince of the warrior Saiyan race, after all.

Within ten meters... Within ten meters...

Just a little farther...

A-All right...

E-Even if I can shut down No.18 with this controller, unless I destroy her, she'll be assimilated by Cell.

I think I can destroy her.

It looks like No.16 can barely move at all.

Now is my only chance.

No.18 was once a cute human girl.

If she hadn't been converted by Doctor Gero...

You have to feel sorry for her.

I don't actually have to destroy her...

No! If she gets assimilated into Cell, he will attain his perfect form, and every person throughout the world could end up getting killed!

Destroy her... Don't destroy her...

Destroy her... Don't destroy her...
Destroy her... Don't destroy her...

Destroy her... Don't destroy her... Destroy her...

See you later.

Bye.

She used to be a cute human girl...

You're...

It couldn't be! An emergency shutdown controller?!

Why does he have one?!


And So the Situation Takes a Turn for the Worst... Cell attacks #18!"   



Don't you want to fight me in my perfect form, prince of a warrior race?

You do indeed know us Saiyans well.

Dad!

Fine. I'll walk right into your trap.

You may attain this so-called "perfect form" of yours. 
Go on!

Dad, no! if you allow that to happen...

I would take no pride in defeating this pathetic scum as he is now.

That is your greatest shortcoming, Dad!

Be silent, Trunks!

Now, go on!

I'm looking forward to this, Cell.

Dad may condone this, but I will not!

Bulma-san, after all the trouble you took to make this, I'm sorry.

Make sure you give him the slip.

Don't you dare get assimilated by Cell. Please.

Why?! Why did you destroy that controller?!

This had to have been your chance to destroy me.

Well, I...

Move it, kid!

If you've got the time to get in my way, why don't you help me find No.18?

There's no longer any need to find No.18.

What?!

That's because you are about to be killed, right here, by me!

What? By a little wet-behind-the-ears punk like you?!

Trunks! Don't interfere!

H-Hey, Vegeta!

Do something about this guy!

No. ! I-I've found you!

Oh, shoot!

I-I've found you, No.18!
So that's where you've been hiding!

Terrific! Now I can reach my perfect form!

Power! Speed! Moves! Brains! Nerves!

The time for me to become the perfect being in all areas is here!

This is bad! They're not paying any attention to us over here!

Why would you throw away your one chance? 
Just what are you up to?

W-Well, I...

Just don't stare me down like that, okay?

It doesn't really matter!

If you just stand around here, Cell is going to swallow you up, right?!
I'm begging you!

The fate of the world rests with you!

Hey!

Cell has spotted you!

What?!

Crap!

I won't let you reach your perfect form!

So that's it. 
Luckily enough,  the Artificial Human is right here.

Awesome!

His Ki has disappeared.

Get out of here! Cell has masked his presence, and is moving around underground!

N-Not good! Not good! Let's beat it, quick!

Y... Yeah.

No.18...

No.18 !

Never mind me. 
You guys run.

I am no longer able to protect you.

Get going, now!

Oh, no!

This is my big chance.
I won't let you interfere, Trunks!

So this is where you are, No.18.

Don't push it, No.16. 
You're just moments from shutdown, aren't you?

Besides, Vegeta is helping me to reach my perfect form.

Damn it, Vegeta...

Now then, to partake of one of my gourmet delights.

That rotten Vegeta!

What? What happened to Vegeta?

Hey!

What has happened to Vegeta?
What about Trunks?

Hey, come on!

Aren't you done yet? Hurry it up, Son!

What are you dawdling around for, Cell?

Hurry up and get your perfect form!

Damn you!

You small fry.

I suppose this is all the power I can expect from a broken-down mechanical dummy.

It doesn't sting one bit.

You monster!

You're making a mistake, Dad!

We can't let him reach his perfect form!

What if his power ends up topping ours?!

Hmph, you're pathetic! Don't you want to see how strong he gets?

I... I don't want to see it!

I've had my fill of a hellish future!

I will stop him from reaching his perfect form, just you watch!

Even if I have to defeat you to do it, Dad!

Defeat me?

Absurd! I doubt you could attack your own father.

Go ahead and shoot me, if you can!

It's all over now.

N-No. ...

We're done for!

Hurry! Get away from here as quickly as you can!

Why, you...!

Don't concern yourself with me.
Get going, now!

I won't do that.

Y-You...

Damn that Trunks.

He really did shoot me.

That filthy little brat!

I-I'm sorry, Father.

It's because I'm so slow that your training isn't getting anywhere.

That's quite okay. You just think about becoming a Super Saiyan.

Right!

Hmph, you won't get away!

You won't get away!

You're not fleeing anywhere, No.18.

That little brat!

Taiyo-ken!!

No-Oh, no!

My eyes!

Now, to savor you thoroughly, No.18!

Damn you!

Stop!

No.18 !

Damn it...!

Cell is changing. This perfect form of his is on the way.

Hmph, he's sure taking his time.
Don't you disappoint me this time.

Damned if I'm going to let you reach your perfect form!

What's going on here?

It feels like the whole Earth is trembling, doesn't it?

It's Cell's Ki. it just keeps expanding!

This is all my fault for not being able to shut down No.18!

I won't allow... l won't allow the future to be at your mercy!

Grand Elder!

Dende, you sense it too, do you?

Uh-huh. But what could this evil Ki be?

What in the world is happening on Earth?

I don't know. I don't know, but the way things are headed, the entire universe could be destroyed, not just Earth.

Hmph, finally finished, are you?

Cell has reached his perfect form.

What do you mean? Didn't Kuririn use the controller I made?

Kuririn stepped on the controller, smashing it.

Why?! Why did he do that?!

Vegeta, you keep up your end now!


The Tables Have Turned! Perfect Form Cell, Finally Goes into Action"   




Are you okay, Gohan?

Gohan?

A long time ago, Piccolo-san said that you weren't cut out to be a teacher, Father.

That you were too nice!

That you were completely lacking in severity toward others!

That it was evident when seeing how spoiled I was!

I've been spoiled by your kindness all this time!

Father, please come at me like you're trying to kill me!

Then, if I really do get killed, it will prove that that was all the strength I had.

And if that's all I am, then there's no way I can surpass you!

I have to be ready for death...or there's no way I can achieve my true strength!

And I won't ever turn Super Saiyan!

Ka...me...ha...me...Ha!!

I'm not going to run away.

I've been such a baby...

B-Back then...

Gohan! Now! shoot him!

...and back then...

Goku!

It was my fault for being so weak.

Everyone was counting on me.

You've finally turned Super Saiyan!

Keep it up.

Now, maintain the state you're in, while suppressing your excitement.

You've done good, Gohan.

I'm sorry, Father. it's so hard...

Hey, you just have to do it a little at a time.

Hmm? Let's take a break.
I'll cut your hair for you.

It's getting a bit too long.

Sure enough, this perfect form of yours doesn't appear to be that big a deal.

Your size has also diminished from earlier.

How dare you take No.18?!

Kuririn-san!

Th-This can't be...

So this is my perfect form.

This is, in all aspects, the perfect body.

Outstanding. I've finally obtained it.

Kienzan!!

--Wha--?
--I-It can't be...

My Kienzan even cut through Freeza...!

Kuririn-san!

That man is lucky to be the first to experience my perfect power.

Please, stay with me, Kuririn-san!

Here's a senzu bean. Can you eat it?

Please, manage to swallow it somehow.

Did pushing that feeble little runt around make you happy?

It would seem, as I expected, that even in your perfect form, you're nothing to write home about.

Excuse me for that.

Now, I wonder if you would assist me with my warming up.

You bet. 
While you're warming up, I'll be finishing you off.

If you please.

Thank goodness, Kuririn-san!

That was a close call.
I thought you were done for.

--Kuririn-san...?
--This is bad. Vegeta is gonna get killed.

I-I definitely may not be much at all when compared to you Saiyans, but I can at least tell more or less what his strength is.

I can tell... I can tell how horrifying he is.

To him, he may have just been brushing me off, but I could tell how horrifying he is.

C-Cell has certainly gotten stronger.

But Vegeta still has the upper hand, in every regard.

Y-You can't count the Ki we're sensing now as being relevant.

He's still concealing a much, much more tremendous power.

Just like you are, Trunks.

You knew, did you?

Mm-hmm.

Tch, I guess this "perfect form" power-up of yours wasn't a total exaggeration, huh?

Vegeta is who he is, so maybe he didn't notice, but I can pretty well tell how you're, you know, holding yourself back on Vegeta's account.

You have overcome the barrier that Vegeta was unable to.

Am I wrong?

You can't escape!

Dad has gone beyond Super Saiyan bounds.

As you can see from his current form, he has acquired incredible power.

But one day, I went beyond even that realm.

I realized that this is what Goku-san was talking about.

I couldn't tell Dad that, though.

As proud as Dad is, I wasn't able to tell him.

Trunks...

D-Dad should have defeated Cell when he had the chance.

Vintage Vegeta.

Your attack just now was pretty good.

Mess with me, will you?!

Take this!

Vegeta sure is impressive.

He's fighting perfect form Cell toe-to-toe.

Hmph, toe-to-toe?

Vegeta is panicking. He's face-to-face with someone with the same--no, perhaps even greater power than he has, and he's unable to make level-headed decisions.

Damn it!

D-Damn it!

I had no idea Cell's power would increase this much after assimilating No.17 and No.18.

What kind of monster has Doctor Gero created?

D-Don't you mock me!

Is that how great the difference in their power levels is now?

D-Damn you!

You're not giving me your all, huh?!

I told you I was just warming up, didn't I?

--What?!
--E-Everything up to now has just been warming up?

Fight me like you mean it!

You must be upset after the beatdown I gave you earlier, Cell!

You haven't changed at all after getting your perfect form!

You're exactly the same as you were when I was smacking you around!

If you don't like it, then show me the power of your perfect form!

Well, maybe just a little bit.

I have become Super Vegeta! Don't mock me!

Oh! He nailed him!

W... What?!

Super Vegeta, huh?

That had to have nailed him.

Vegeta's kick had to have landed squarely on one of Cell's vital spots.

And yet, he's taken no damage at all.
He really is a monster.

Trunks, aren't you going to help him, with that secret power of yours?

Dad... Dad would be far more humiliated by having me or Goku-san help him than he would by being beaten by Cell.

That's the kind of man that Dad is.

Yeah, but...

Vegeta's kick made a direct impact on Cell's vital spot.

But Cell has taken no damage at all.

I-Is that how wide a gap there is between their power levels now?

What's the matter?

Where's all that enthusiasm you had a moment ago?

I-I...

I put everything I had into that kick...

H-How...?

What's the matter? Smile, Vegeta.

Well, well. You said that the gap between us was too great, and that fighting me was dull.
Might I say the same about you?

What are you doing, Trunks?!
If you don't help Vegeta right now,

he really is going to get killed!

If he dies, you won't be able to say jack about his pride!

No-Once Dad loses consciousness fighting Cell, I'll help him.

No-Once Dad loses consciousness, Dad won't have to see me surpass him.

Are you still on about that?!

Kuririn-san!

To Dad, pride is something he cannot live without.

Without his pride, Dad would not be Dad!

It's what makes him stronger, while also making him more isolated.

But I'm sure it's that aspect of Dad that drew Mom to him...and me, too...

Trunks...

L-Let's hope he doesn't get killed before he gets knocked out.

Hmph, you scum.
Vegeta, unfortunately for you, it looks like my warming up will finish you.

D-Damn it all!

Before we part, I have to express my gratitude...to your stupidity, for helping me to reach my perfect form.


Full-Power Strike of Vegeta! But the Terror of Cell Grows and Grows"   




Whoo, I'm famished!

Let's see, this... and this... and this, too!

These are Gohan's favorite. All right...

Hey, Gohan!

Let's have something to eat!

Right!

Yeah, you've gotta eat up, and keep your body strong, or Chichi is gonna be mad at me, too.

--Right.
--Okay, Gohan, cook this for me.

Thank you!

Y-Your hair...

Gohan, you have to learn some power control quick, huh?

Y-Yes.

Yow, that's hot!

Don't bother wasting your efforts when you know what the outcome will be, No.16.

Right now, you're nothing more than a piece of junk, who's unable to do a thing.

D-Dad!

What is he planning to do?

D-Dad!

Cell!

Regardless of how strong your perfect form might be, do you have the guts to take this head-on?!

I doubt it! You're just a big pantywaist!

H-He's provoking Cell, to get him to not dodge this attack.

Y-You've gotta be kidding!

Does he really mean to use that move on the surface of the Earth?!

Please don't do it!

The Earth... The Earth as we know it will be...!

Get out of here, Trunks!

Final Flash!!

No-Oh, crap--

W-We survived...

Dad took everything into account, and narrowed the range just enough.

H-He felt that one.

Hmph, take that!

No-Oh, no...

H-He got him. He really got him!

How can this be? Not my...

Not my perfect form...!

Damn it!

Gotcha.

Laugh it up, you fool.

Or have you forgotten that I also carry Piccolo's blood?

Disappointed?

Now then, it's about time I killed you.

Damn it!

Dad...!

Hey, he's no longer Super Saiyan!

He's unconscious!

E-Either that, or he's d-d--

You're a tough one. I'll put you out of your misery now, Vegeta.

Trunks, it's now or never!

Now's the time for you to turn that awesome level of Super Saiyan!

T-Trunks...?

Now, this is the end for you, Vegeta.

Gohan, anything goes. Try to catch me.

All right...!

Whoa!

Nicely read. But you've still got a ways to go!

Whoa!

Whew, that was close!

Father...

--Caught you.
--Whoops.

Nicely done, Gohan.

Right.

Then again, we overdid it, huh?

W-We were caught up in the moment.

We'll have to fix that, or Popo will be mad at us.

Right.

What is that?

Trunks!

H-He's not even putting any power behind it, yet his Ki is terrific!

W-What is the deal with these Saiyans?

Kuririn-san...

Would you please take Dad to Muten Roshi-sama's place for me?

Great, you can still talk normally.

I thought you might have snapped, like when Goku and the others become great apes.

I'm fine. But never mind me. Here.

When you get a chance, please give that senzu to Dad.

Y-Yeah. But are you sure about this?

Do you have a senzu for yourself, as well?

I will not need a senzu for myself.

Because I am sure that I will win.

H-He must be incredibly self-assured, to say something like that.

He's strong! He was keeping that much power under wraps?

I'm going to kill you, Cell.

That's pretty tough talk, Trunks.

They're gone!

W-What?!

That's pretty respectable, Trunks.

Impressive.

To think that you could evade that by a whisker.

Trunks...

H-He's done for...

R-Right.

He's doing this to allow me to rescue Vegeta.

For your pride's sake, you allowed Cell to reach his perfect form, and now look at you.

Trunks is fighting right now with awesome power.

He's become much stronger than you are.

And the fact that we don't get to see this magnificent battle is also because of your ridiculous pride.

I may think we're better off without you, but apparently, Trunks believes differently.

Good grief, what's so great about a father like this?

Are you finally able to fight now, without any distractions?

Vegeta has been taken away, and all.

Y-You knew?

Of course I did, as well as the fact that you were intentionally leading me away from Vegeta.

I'm surprised that you would know that, and still let him go.

Naturally. My interest no longer lies with him.

It lies in your true power.

I didn't realize you knew that much.

I look forward to this.

The time has come for me to find out how strong my perfect form is.


Super Power Awakening! Trunks Surpasses his Father"   


That's a frighteningly powerful Ki.

That's Trunks' Ki.

It's awesome. And we're pretty far away already, too.

Saiyans really are frightening.

That is an amazing Ki. I-Is that...?

It's Trunks' K

It's even more incredible than Vegeta's.

Hands down, incredible.
He can beat Cell like this.

You have spectacular power.

Indeed, your father Vegeta cannot compare to you.

I will not let you Artificial Humans do as you please any longer.

That tragic future will not befall Earth again.

I will not allow that hell to be repeated!

Good, good, better and better.
Such outstanding power.

You may have exceeded even me. I am pleased.

Doctor Gero-sama is surely rejoicing from the grave, as well.

After all, I have finally stumbled upon someone against whom I can test my ultimate power.

I'd like to hurry and test the fearsome power of my perfect form.

That's just what I want, Cell.

I will now show you the true power of a Saiyan.

I can fight with cruel fate.

I just want to change my world. 

If there is more than just one future, then I have no other choice but to fight

During those hellish days, I realized I have no choice but to get stronger now.

Change the future!!

Though I may be all alone, I will fight

I am going to kill you.

I will now release the power given to me, by all the others.

I want to change my world.

I can fight with cruel fate.

Indeed, you truly do have outstanding power, well beyond my own.

But you still won't beat me like that. Not a chance.

Hmph, that's nothing but empty bravado.

Hmm, is it?

H-Hey, are you all right, Vegeta?

I have to hurry and give him his senzu.

Over there will do.

Hey, Vegeta...

Here's a senzu. Swallow this, will you?

Vegeta, you're coming around.

Damn that Cell!

Damn!

It's still increasing, huh?
Still, it's no use. You cannot beat me.

What tremendous power!

He's completely overshadowing Cell!

U-Unbelievable!

Say, who exactly is? Don't just stand there talking to yourselves--explain it so I can understand, too.

We're talking about Trunks, of course!

Huh? Trunks?

Hooray! You sure are strong, huh?

Anger... Anger is what makes me a Super Saiyan.

Huh? When did he manage to get so strong?

I can't wait. This really could turn out to be something amazing.

Father has just been sitting there like that for the last few days.

Sure enough, going beyond Super Saiyan must be pretty hard.

All right...!

That's an amazing Ki!

Father, that's amazing!

You're beyond it! Father, you're already beyond Super Saiyan!

A further transformation is still possible.

Y-You did it!

That's tremendous power!

Father, you can't be beaten by anyone like that!

You're sure to beat Cell!

D-Damn it!

I-Impossible... This is impossible.

W-Why can't I hit him?

You've let me down, too.

You're no test for my perfect form strength like that.

What?!

D-Damn it!

No matter how many times you try, it will be the same.

There is no way in the world that you can win against me.

Why? Why?!

A-As powered-up as I've become...

Father!

You can beat him for sure!

For sure!

I ain't gonna beat Cell like this. Not likely.

Huh? Why ngt?

My appearance is awesome, and so is my power.

But with my muscles as swollen as this, while my power might be greater, my speed is diminished.

A huge power ain't any good if you can't hit your opponent.

I ain't gonna beat a monster like Cell this way.

Besides, the energy consumption is too severe.

Balance-wise, the regular Saiyan size is still the best.

That much is clear.

--Gohan
--Yes?

From here on, except when you're asleep, stay in your Super Saiyan state as much as you can.

We're going to make that our normal state.

We should start by eliminating the restive feeling we get when we turn Super Saiyan.

After that, we'll start training the fundamentals from the top.

It's a bit of a detour, but I think it's the best thing to do.

Right! Okay, Father, I'll do it!

Such a greenhorn.

To say that you're going to show me your true power, then to undergo a transformation that depends even more on power.

A transformation like that is easy.

But a transformation just to gain a power increase like this doesn't produce anything.

Not a thing.

Yes, anyone could have figured that much out.

Even your father, Vegeta.

You are a fool.

I-Is that right?

F-Father was able to do this transformation, too.

But he deliberately chose not to, because he knew it would turn out like this.

What a fool I've been.

I've completely lost any chance of winning.

kill me.

I believe I will.

T-Trunks' Ki just dropped like a stone!

W-What's happened? What's happened to him?

Cell's Ki is still huge. Has Trunks been done in?

He said he could beat him.

D-Damn that Cell!

Hey, what are you planning to do?

There's only one thing to do! Go and kill him!

"Are You...'?
"Shut up!

For Pete's sake, those Saiyans are one out-of-this-world warrior race.

I can't keep up with them.

Say, has Trunks beaten him yet?

The guy's incredible.

Is Trunks really that incredible?

No, what's incredible is Cell's perfect form.

Trunks is going to get killed!

I'm fairly disappointed in both you and your father Vegeta.

I expected you to be more entertaining.

I have one final question.

Though I did utterly defeat you in the end, you and Vegeta achieved a sharp increase in power in a short period of time.

What exactly did you do?

You don't feel like talking?
Then let me change the question.

If you had more time, would it be possible to increase even further?

Well?

Hell if I can tell! I'll never know without trying.

But why would you ask something like that?

So you're saying it's not impossible.

Then I'll ask another question.

What is Son Goku doing?
Why hasn't he shown up here?

Goku-san is in the middle of training, so he can defeat you!

Knowing Goku-san, he's sure to defeat you, and make our wishes come true!
I'm absolutely certain of that!

Good answer.

Well then, I'm going to hold a martial arts tournament.

Martial arts tournament?

I'll hold it in ten days. It'll be my treat.

Get as strong as you can, and come entertain me.

W-What do you mean?

You may not be aware of this, but once, there was a martial arts tournament called the "Tenkaichi Budokai" tournament.

I'm offering to recreate that.

However, it will be me alone against you all.

We'll fight one-on-one, and if I win, the next person will fight me.

I don't care how many there are.

The more of you there are, the better your chances will be.

Get together as many of you as you can.

I'll inform you of the location and other details shortly.

By a  TV broadcast, perhaps.

What?!

This should do well to stave off my boredom.

Bye, now.

You should get a good deal of senzu beans ready.

W-Wait, Cell! What is the purpose of this tournament?!

And what is your ultimate objective?

I can't make any sense of this at all!

Are you out to conquer the world--no, the universe?!

The purpose of the tournament is to affirm the strength of my perfect form, as well as to plunge the world into terror.

It will also serve as an exercise to further draw out my strength.

I don't have any particular ultimate objective.

I'm not interested in such vulgar pursuits as conquest.

The purpose for which I was originally created, to kill Son Goku, now means very little to me.

You might say that my goal is to enjoy myself.

My greatest goal, of course, is to see the look of terror on the faces of humanity.

Yes, yes, that's the look.

Goodbye.


The Television Has Been hijacked! A Live Broadcast of the Cell Games Press Conference"   


My greatest goal, of course, is to see the look of terror on the faces of humanity.

Yes, yes, that's the look.

Damn it!

Th-Thank goodness, he made it through okay.

B-But what happened? Where did Cell go?

H-Hey, wait up!

Dad...

What on earth happened here?

What happened to Cell?

I'm sorry. There was nothing that I could do.

Hmph, of course not.

There's no way that you could have defeated Cell in his perfect form!

That's not true! In fact, Trunks' power makes yours look like--

Kuririn-san!

No-Okay...

There, there...

Hey, you guys! Don't just stand there, hurry and go help him!

Trunks is... Trunks is going to die, isn't he?!

Take it easy. He got away without being killed.

--Really?
--H-How?

What a piece of work Cell is!

Trunks' power earlier was positively greater than Cell's.

What exactly caused the difference between them?

It looks like I'll have to enter the Room of Spirit and Time next.

A-A martial arts tournament?

Th-That's what he said?

Damn it, he's using us like his toys!

But who's going to enter?

This is someone that you guys couldn't do anything against.

L...

I intend to go back into the Room of Spirit and Time once Goku-san comes out, and try training once again.

Neither you nor Kakarrot will be needed.

Once I use that room for one more day, it will be enough.

M-Me, too...

I'm entering the tournament, too.

No.16 ...

P-Please, take me to the Capsule Corporation.

You want to go to my mom's place?

Y-Yes. There, I will have them repair me so that I can fight again.

I promise, I will make myself useful.

Screw you!

You're one of Doctor Gero's Artificial Humans, aren't you?!

Sure. I'll take you there and ask them.

Kuririn-san!

You don't have to worry, Trunks.
I don't think he's a bad guy.

Even so...!

The two that Cell swallowed up weren't all that awful, either.

Their very character really is different from the Artificial Humans in your future.

Besides, right now, we can take all the strong allies we can get, right?

Easy, now...

Thanks.

Hurry and come on out of there, Kakarrot.

Whatever you might be doing, it won't be any use.

As long as I can get inside that room once again, we won't have to deal with Cell acting too big for his britches.

Oh, how pretty.

Oh, my, Vegeta-chan, long time no see.

You're still as handsome as ever.

My, and this gentleman over here is handsome, as well.

Are you an acquaintance of Vegeta's?

H-Hi there, pleased to meet you.

Excuse me, but is Bulma-san here?

--Huh?
--Um, I need to see Bulma-san.

--Yo, Kuririn!
--Um, I need to see Bulma-san.

I just got a call from Bulma.

She said she's on her way here.

She still hasn't returned from the Heavenly Realm, then? I see.

Hey!

Muten Roshi-sama!

We got a call from Bulma to all come back to the Capsule Corporation.

We can't tell what the current state of affairs is at the Kame House.

Where is Gohan-chan?!

Well, he's still up in the Heavenly Realm.

Aw, still?

Hmm, this is put together well.
Not bad, Doctor Gero.

You don't say. A Tenkaichi Budokai tournament, huh?

Yes, that's what Cell said.
It's to be held in ten days.

He said he would reveal the location and so forth later.

Will the matches be held tournament-style?

No, I'm not sure how it will be, exactly.

Here you go.

Mr. Turtle Hermit, what exactly is a Tenkaichi-whatever tournament?

Oh, well, having won the Tenkaichi Budokai myself, allow me to explain it to you.

Ahem, once upon a time, there was this tournament where all the martial arts masters would get together to determine who was the greatest in the world.

As I recall, Goku and the others started participating at the st Tenkaichi Budokai.

It was his first appearance, and he made it all the way to the championship match.

But his opponent was too much for him.

He met his defeat when facing the master Jackie Chun.

Five years after that, the 22nd Tenkaichi Budokai was held.

This time around, Tenshinhan and Chaozu confronted us.

It was there that Goku and Tenshinhan competed for victory, and Goku lost by a very narrow margin.

Hmph, what low-caliber battles.

Three years later, when the 23rd Tenkaichi Budokai was held--now, that was one incredibly stormy tournament.

After all, Goku ended up getting married, Piccolo competed under the name of Ma Junior, and Kami-sama possessed a man in order to compete.

It got so normal people couldn't compete in the tournament.

Then, in the championship match, Goku and Piccolo engaged in mortal combat, with the fate of the world at stake.

In the end, Goku won, and became the strongest man on the face of the earth.

However, the ring was lost, and ever since, the Tenkaichi Budokai tournament has not been held.

That was, let's see... how many years ago now?

Huh, Kuririn?

Oh, is that a fact?
That sounds like quite an ordeal.

Now then, for the tournament grounds.

I suppose right here will do.

I think I'll make the ring a little bigger than the Tenkaichi Budokai ring.

Next...

Just as I thought, the stone here looks to be of fine quality.

Good. it's a bit rustic-looking, but I'll think of something later.

Now, I suppose I should get to a  TV station.

It looks like your construction is totally different from these human-based Artificial Humans.

I am completely machine-based, and was built from nothing.

Which would mean that this won't be much of a reference.

Then, you can't repair me?

Hey, don't worry. Once Bulma gets back, we'll manage something.

Bulma's the one who knows more about you folks.

--These are good!
--These cakes really are delicious.

Aren't they? I still have plenty more, so eat as much as you like.

This chocolate is mine!

Hey, Oolong, I had my eye on that one!

My fingers were faster than your eyes!

--My, I'm so glad you find them so tasty. I still have many more.
--Geez, Oolong and the others sure are relaxed.

Damn it, Cell, what are you waiting for?

If you're going to appear, hurry up and do it!

Trunks, are you sure he said he would give more details on  TV?

Yes, I'm certain.

Yamucha-sama!

Pu-erh, if Cell shows up on the  TV, let me know.

I'm going to go work out outside.

Right, Yamucha-sama.

There are only nine more days until Cell's tournament.

I guess you're right.

Yamucha-san, let me tag along with you.

Thank you, Kuririn.

Yeah, if the tournament has rules, no one will be dying.

It's been so long, I can't wait to go at it.

You're not going to get a shot this time around, either.

As long as I'm there, it'll be enough.

For someone who just got trounced by Cell, you've got a pretty big mouth, don't you?

What was that?

After I train in the Room of Spirit and Time for one more day,

I'll settle everything!

There won't be any room for scum like you!

Scum, are we?

I only call you scum because that's what you are.

Dad...

Trunks!

Trunks! Trunks!

Trunks, where are you?!

Trunks...

Oh, you're hale and hearty, aren't you?

Piccolo just said that you got away without being killed, so I flew here, thinking that maybe you'd been terribly injured.

S-Sorry to do that to you.

Geez, don't go worrying your mother like that.

I'm sorry to have worried you.

Mom...

Hey, let go!

H-Hey, let me go!

Looks like Trunks is tugging at Trunks' hair!

Where are they doing a show that is being broadcast worldwide?

T-T-Top floor, in Studio B...

Thank you, miss.

One-two! One-two! One-two! One-two!...

Outstanding!

What? Where, where?

Good grief, you're such a dirty old man.

This is his favorite program.

Bend over even more...

Nice...

Cell!

W-Who are you?!

Is this the top floor, Studio B?

Th-That's right!

Call in the guard!

People of the world, good morning.

I've decided to interrupt your  TV viewing for just a brief moment.

As it happens, I bring wonderful news to those of you who are enjoying living in peace.

News that will allow you to spend your days filled with more fun, and more thrills.

My name is Cell. I believe you are well aware of the daily incidents where many people have been wiped out by a monster.

I am the evolved, transformed version of that monster.

In that regard, I thank you for offering me so much of your life energy.

You may rest easy, as I no longer have any need for your life energy.

I have decided to hold a martial arts tournament called the "Cell Games."

The location will be at marker 34, 20 KS northwest of Metro Central.

I have readied a ring there.

Unlike the Tenkaichi Budokai, if the contestant playing for all of you loses, we will play such that they switch out with the next contestant.

This works to your advantage.

Strong as I may be, if I fight too many matches, I may grow fatigued.

The rules will be roughly the same as the Tenkaichi Budokai tournament.

If you resign, or any part of your body touches outside the ring, you lose.

And while I do intend to hold back, if you are killed, you lose.

If all the players fighting for all of you end up losing...

What?!

...I have decided to kill every person in the world.

To the very last person, allowing no one to escape, all the while gazing at your terrified faces.

Miserable Cell!

And with that, I would like all of you who are sure of your own strength to come and participate.

Unless you want to end up like this.

Well then, I'm looking forward to it.

Th-The guy is beyond the pale!

He's going to kill all the people in the world?

Who is able to fight someone like that?!

Vegeta and Trunks didn't do any good against him?

And not even Goku...

Are you going somewhere, Vegeta?

It makes no difference to me how many earthlings may die, but I will not rest until I've killed that bastard.

I'm coming, too!

Trunks! Before you go, I'll cut your hair for you.

It must be in the way, right?

Thank you.


Training Completed! Goku, Does he have the Composure to Defeat Cell?!"   



The whole world is shaken by Cell's  TV broadcast.

And so, the people have started to endeavor in vain to hide themselves in backwoods areas difficult to target.

It is truly a panic.

I-It's all my fault. if only I'd...destroyed No.18 when I had the chance...

I'm going to go fight Cell!

--What?!
--It's all my fault!

--Kuririn!
--You can't go!

This is not an opponent you can fight and win.

As your master, I will not allow you to throw your life away!

However, if you insist, do it after the Cell Games have begun.

Don't blame yourself so much, Kuririn.

Put your money on Goku and the others.

On how much those Saiyans, with the amount of outlandish potential they keep under wraps, are able to power up in the Room of Spirit and Time.

How much longer before Goku-san and Gohan-san come out?

Still nearly three hours until one full day.

Hmph, they won't necessarily come out after one full day.

My hunch is he'll get greedy, and go far longer than his time.

There's no rush. There are still nine more days until game day.

It hasn't even been a full day since you got out of the room, has it?

You should get some rest.

I'm going in first.

That will be a waste of time.

Only Saiyans can set foot in the territory that lies ahead.

Well, have it your way, but I'm taking the remaining eight days for myself.

I hate to have to tell you this...but the Room of Spirit and Time can only be entered for two days-- hours-- in one's lifetime.

W-What?!

What happens if you go over hours?

The room's door disappears.
Never able to come out again.

Even so, Dad, we can still use it for another hours or so.

That's Goku and Gohan's Ki.
They're already coming out of the room?

They're what? W-Why so soon?

Huh? Vegeta and Trunks are here, after all.

I can sense Cell's Ki, too, so he's still alive.

What exactly is going on?

Is that Gohan? I barely recognize him.

Somebody tell us what's going on.

Well, as it happens...

But, before you do, Mister Popo, I wonder if I can get something to eat.

I'm awfully famished!

Y-Yeah...

That's just like you, Goku.

Oh, yum!

It really is delicious.

Goku, can I ask you something?

You guys did eat while you were in there, right?

Uh-huh, ob gourse ee ade.

Hey, swallow what's in your mouth, and then speak.

And chew it, too!

Of course we ate.

We did eat, but me and Gohan ain't able to cook too much, so it's been a long time since we had anything this good!

No-Oh...

What's up with them? Are they Super Saiyan?

No, it feels a bit off.

They're perfectly natural in that state.

Thank you, that was delicious!

Whoo, I'm stuffed!

Okay, sorry to keep you waiting, Trunks. Talk away.

R-Right. As it happens...

Oh, so these circuits connect here, huh?

What is all this? I'm peeking through No.16's memory, and there's nothing but information on Son-kun in here.

Let me see...

indeed it is.

See? I'm sure that No.16 is an Artificial Human built by Doctor Gero for the sole purpose of defeating Son-kun.

But right now, he doesn't show any signs of that, does he?

Or maybe somewhere in there, he's still thinking about defeating Son-kun.

Nah...

His circuits are so complex that I can't tell for sure, but I doubt he's all that bad a guy.

There's no mistaking one thing, though--he has an unusual gentleness about him.

He sure does.

Maybe it's because history has been altered, but when you think about it, this is lucky for us.

After all, he's become an important warrior for us in the fight against Cell.

Strange things do happen, huh?

So that's what's up.

A martial arts tournament, huh?
What a fascinating idea.

F-Fascinating?

Mister Popo, you ain't tossed out my gi, have you?

N-No, I haven't.

I washed it for you.

Thank you, Mister Popo.

You don't have to wear that.
You can ask Mom to give you a new one.

No, I really do prefer this.
I wanna fight as an earthling.

Piccolo-san, I'd like some new clothes, too.

Your outfit, Piccolo-san.

All right. I'll fix up a handsome present for you.

Thank you, Piccolo-san!

So...

How about it? Do you think you can defeat Cell?

I don't know. I ain't even seen him since he got his perfect form.

I think I'll go have a quick look.

Son Goku?

Yeah, that's right.

What do you think? This is the Cell Games ring, where the fate of the world will be determined in nine days.

Do you like it?

Kind of a cheesy ring for deciding fate in.

You've finally gone and attained it.

So that's your perfect form, huh?

That is correct.

I will be at the games, that's for sure.

So until then, don't go killing a single person. 
Got it?

This is going to be a good match.

Son Goku, huh?

This event is going to be even more fun than I thought.

How did it go, Goku-san?

To be honest, I didn't think he'd be that awesome.

I can't even guess how strong he might become if he puts his mind to it.

I ain't gonna be sure until I go at him, but the way things stand, I probably can't beat him.

Y-You don't mean...

I-I see...

You should use the Room of Spirit and Time again.

There is time. We settled on the order earlier.

I'm going in afterward, then Vegeta will go in alone.

Hmph, once I go in, there really won't be any need for anyone else to.

Sorry, but I'm going to take a pass.

He's really not the sort of opponent I can fight.

Then Trunks.

After that, Goku and Gohan, you'll go in again.

Nope, me and Gohan have had enough.

What?!

We'll train in the outer world.
With nine more days, we'll get by.

W-What?!

Enough, you say?

You mean, you're not going back into the Room of Spirit and Time?

Yeah, that's right.

Why not? You can still spend an entire day in there.

Being inside there is awfully hard on the body, even when doing nothing at all.

We ain't gonna be able to rest enough if we do.

Hmph, well, well...

Even the great Kakarrot is giving in to the extreme conditions of the room.

Maybe.

But forcing our bodies to train any more would just be agonizing.

That ain't training.

But I ain't got any problem with the rest of you going in the room.

It looks like you can still afford to train some more.

What was that? I don't like what I just heard.

The way you put it, it almost sounds like you're saying that your strength is higher than mine now.

Yeah, I think it's a lot higher.

What?!

Okay, let's all hang in there.
I'll see you all at the tournament.

Let's go, Gohan.

Right.

Is it okay if we make a stop on the way?

Yes.

Hello, Karin-sama.

Hello. Long time no see.

Oh, you sure have grown.

Yo, Yajirobe! You're back, huh?

What're you here for, Son?
I'm tellin' ya right now, no matter what happens, I am not gonna enter that tournament!

That's okay. I ain't asking you to enter it, am I?

Well, okay then.

After all, I'm there to come through when it really matters, right?

Ya might even call me yer secret weapon.

Listen to you.

Then again, the Earth is in a real jam this time.

The lower realm is in a huge uproar.

Yeah. Cell really is awesome.
After reaching his perfect form, his strength is even more impeccable.

You seem to be pretty relaxed about it, all things considered.

What, did you make some wonderful discovery in the Room of Spirit and Time?

Oh, you know...

I-Is that it? I was there with Father the whole time.

Say, Karin-sama, you can pretty well tell Cell's strength by looking at him from here, right?

Mm-hmm. He hasn't revealed his true strength, so I can't say for sure, but I can more or less guess.

Okay, compare the two of us, will you?

I'm going to power myself up now.

H-Hey, Goku and Gohan were Super Saiyan just now, right?

I have to say, they seemed pretty--how can I put it? 
Natural, I suppose.

I don't think there's any doubt that they were Super Saiyan.

But they must have trained themselves so that they could maintain that state on a normal, everyday level.

Th-Then, when they fight, they undergo an even greater transformation?

What are you, dense?

You haven't learned a single thing, have you?

Kakarrot has judged that state to be best.

By growing accustomed to being like that normally, they can increase their battle power with only minimal strain on their bodies.

Tch, he put some thought into this.

Th-That's right.

A transformation for the sake of increased power produces nothing.

What is that Ki?!

I-It's Goku!

S-Stop, already! You're going to fracture the place!

That was about half of it. What do you think?

H-Half, you say? What a frightful man you are!

How strong are you going to get before you're finally happy?

Is that true?

Has Father really gotten that impressive?

So, Karin-sama, what do you think, compared to Cell?

You ask a difficult question.

Like I said before, I can only offer a guess...but if you want to know the truth, I think Cell still has you topped.

Th-This Cell guy's an outta-this-world bastard, huh?

Yeah, sure enough.

My expectation wasn't wrong.
Thank you, Karin-sama.

Let's go, Gohan.

R-Right.

S-Sorry for the intrusion.

They vanished! That guy ain't human no more!

Any way I consider this, Goku doesn't have a chance of winning.

So why was he so composed?

I doubt he's simply taken up a so-what attitude.

I've got to say, that Ki was tremendous.

What's more, he couldn't have been using all of his power yet.

If he were to generate his actual full power...incredible! 
He just might be able to beat Cell!

D-Damn you, Kakarrot!

You're always... always one step ahead of me!

You are one downright aggravating bastard!

No sooner do I catch up to you than you pull away again!

Piccolo, if you're going to go in the room, then go, already!

You're holding up the line.

Let's pick up your mom and go home.

We'll be more at ease there.

Three days rest, three days training, then three more days of rest.

Then, it's the tournament.

S-Say, Father...

Are you sure we should be doing this?

Will we be able to beat Cell like this?

Don't worry, don't worry.
Come on, let's go call your mom.

Come on, come on, come on.

Heya!

What's the matter with you guys?

G-Goku?

Yeah.

Is that really you, Goku?

Yeah, it is. What are you talking about, Old Timer?

Then, you're Gohan?

I didn't recognize you.

Wow, yeah!

H-Hi there.

What is it? Is it Goku-ss?

A-Are you... Gohan-chan?

Huh? Th-That's right.

W-What's happened to the color of your hair?! 
Did you dye it?!

Ow-w-w...

No, it ain't like that, Chichi.

My Gohan-chan has gone and turned delinquent!


An Interrupted Rest! The Self-Defense Army, Launches a General Offensive Against Cell"   



Well then, perhaps I'll do a little light warming up.

Hmph... at a time like this, the cells of Freeza and his father sure come in handy.

It may be a silly little sideshow, but I'll give those humans a little something to watch.

W-What are you doing?!
Hurry up and move forward!

Ah, how pretty!

What could that be?

shooting stars, in the middle of the day?

Goku-sa!

Huh?

Gohan-chan!

My word, where did those two go runnin' off to?

It sure is quiet here.

Yeah.

Say, Father...

I'm happy.

Why's that?

Because a long time ago, you made me a promise to take me fishing.

Did I really ever promise you that?

Remember? When you first fought Vegeta-san.

Huh? When?

You know, back then.

Don't you remember, Goku?

Goku, sorry about always having to leave our fate up to you alone.

Don't you dare go dying now, my good friend.

Yeah.

Gohan, after Daddy comes back home alive, let's go fishing together or something, okay?

Heh, right?

Oh yeah, back then!

We've done all sorts of training and whatnot since then, but you never once took me fishing.

Sorry about that, Gohan.

Mm-mm.

Goku, the truth is, I've been meaning to apologize to you.

What for?

The reason Cell was able to reach his perfect form is because I wasn't able to shut down No.18.

Ah, don't give it another thought.

I've gotten stronger, and Gohan was also able to get some decent training in.

I just feel kind of guilty, always having you bail me out.

What do you mean, Kuririn?
You and I are pals, ain't we?

Yeah, but lately, there's been such a huge gap between us.

It almost doesn't seem true that you were once right there, fighting with me.

It doesn't? To me, our training together under Old Man Turtle Hermit seems like it just happened yesterday.

Aw, cut it out. it's ancient history now.

Oh, what are you fronting for?

H-Help me, Goku!

Ah, Kuririn, I'm sorry!

Same old Goku! Falling for the oldest trick in the book!

Now you've done it, Kuririn!

Goku really is unaffected, exactly like he's always been.

That's it! Goku and Gohan are still training, even like this!

All right, let's put him to the test.

It may look like he's asleep, but I'm sure he's well aware of his surroundings.

I'll bet he dodges this rock like it was a matter of course.

No doubt about it!

Ee-yow!

What did you do that for, Kuririn?!

S-Sorry!

I may be a Super Saiyan, but when it hurts, it hurts!

Huh...?

Mm, yum...

That was delicious.

Okay, Gohan, when you're finished eatin', it's time to study.

Right.

Is this the training in the outer world that Goku was talking about?

Is he really going to be able to beat Cell like this?

Tch, what is that scum dragging his feet for?!

Or has he gone and croaked in there?!

Th-There still some time left before hours up.

Damn it!

Just go one second over, I dare you!

I'll drag you out of there, if I have to break down the door to do it!

Ah, coming out!

Hmph, you've finally come out, have you?

Now then, it's my turn.

Piccolo-san's power has risen to a whole different order of magnitude.

What's with you? You haven't changed at all.

What were you doing, napping in there?

Just you watch, Kakarrot!

I will surpass you, I swear it!

People of the world, the Royal Defense Force is determined to stop the monster who calls himself Cell with everything they have.

Please, do not fall into panic, and act with all calmness--

There's no way the military can beat him, you know.

The only thing we can do is count on Son-kun and the others.

I have to say, though, this really is incredible.

As if having super power greater than even No.17 and No.18 wasn't surprising enough, he even has a device that allows him to detect Ki.

And I have no idea what material he's made of, to boot.

Oh, there's one! Look, over there!

There are some huge fish in this lake.

Say, Father...

Are you sure we should be taking it easy like this?

Good grief, how can you be so calm?

Don't worry about it, I tell you.
Something will turn up. Probably.

P-Probably?

It's okay, we're gonna win! I told you, didn't I?

There ain't no point in training so hard no more.

We've pushed ourselves to the limit.

R-Right.

Well, if you say so, Goku, I guess I'll have to trust you.

Guys! Lunch is all ready!

Oh, thank you!

Come on, don't worry about it, and let's just enjoy ourselves.

I know! On the way back, let's all stop by and see Muten Roshi-sama.

Yeah.

What an awful traffic jam.

Everyone's runnin' away from the cities.

You can't blame them.

You want to think that you'll be safer out in the country.

Maybe, I guess.

None of the stores are open. Everyone is gone.

You're overconfident?

Well, people think they might be dyin' in seven days.

Come on, if you wanna touch me, come and get me.

Nobody is goin' to work.

Aw, there's no way we can do any shoppin'.

Let me feel the force of your will before I go and explode.

I was hoping to buy a gift to take to Old Man Turtle Hermit's.

But it's not like I hate your--

We interrupt this program for this news bulletin.

Oh, someone is still working.

The Royal Defense Force has been heading to marker , KS in order to defeat the monster who calls himself Cell.

The attack appears to be about to start.

What?!

Behold, ladies and gentlemen!

This vast army is the total assembled might of the Royal Defense Force!

However powerful this monster may be, he will be powerless against this!

Th-The military?

Fools! What are they thinking?!

Don't they know they're just gonna get killed for nothing?!

Well, well, an army of buffoons has arrived.

Prepare to attack!

He's running!

Fool. I just don't want you destroying the ring that I worked so hard to build.

Don't let him get away! Fire!
Commence full-scale attack!

An incredible concerted attack is underway!

Just listen to that thunderous roar!

I-It's a tremendous assault!
It's still... still going on!

After taking an onslaught like this, I'm sure he's long since been blown to pieces!

G-Get out of there! Hurry!

All right! Cease fire!

Halt! That's enough!

How do you like that? Serves you right!

I-It can't be!

I-Impossible...

He's still alive!

H-He's a monster!

I'll have to give these fools their punishment.

I don't believe it! He's alive!

C-Cell... Cell is standing there like nothing happened!

D-Don't do it, Cell! Don't kill them!

Stop!

D-Damn it...

That was diverting.

Sorry to do this, but you guys go on home without me.

I need to go see Piccolo for a bit.

S-Say, what does he need to see Piccolo for?

Search me.

Goku!

Hey!

Huh? Piccolo, by any chance, did you go into the Room of Spirit and Time, too?

--That's right.
--Yeah, I knew it! I can tell!

You've risen to a whole different level!

Why don't you just come out and say it? I may have gotten stronger, but it still won't be of any use against Cell.

Mm-hmm, it ain't no use.

Tch, you really did come out and say it.

By the way, what are you doing here?

Are you able to go back to being two people, like you were before merging with Kami-sama?

--What?
--You know.

Once Kami-sama and Piccolo merged, the Dragon Balls disappeared, right?

We have to revive them somehow, and bring back to life all the many people that got killed by Cell.

I think we're gonna need them later, too.

I get you. But unfortunately, I can't do that.

Once we merge together, we can never come apart again.

If we could, I wouldn't have held off on merging with Kami as long as I did.

So, that won't work, huh? Yeah, I guess not.

Hey, I heard from Gohan that the surviving Namekian folks went off to some other world, right?

I think I'll go look for them.

What?

If possible, I can find one of them who wouldn't mind coming to stay on Earth for a long time.

We'd get a Kami-sama and the Dragon Balls back. See?

I'm gonna step out for a bit to search for the Namekians.

If you find new Kami-sama, Popo happy, too!

But Goku, how are you going to get them to come here?

We don't even know what planet they went to.

It's going to take too much time.

What are you talking about?

I've got my instantaneous Movement, ain't I?

Piccolo, I'll just search for a Ki similar to yours, and that will be the planet with the Namekians.

Can you sense out Ki that are that far away?

Probably. As long as they ain't too far away, I think it'll be okay.

I'll try it right now. Keep quiet, everybody.

Sorry, no good! Now what do we do?

I-I know! I can probably search for them from Kaio-sama's place.

Let's see... Kaio-sama, Kaio-sama...

Found him!

+-
Do you think this will work?

I-I don't know if we should be counting on him or not.

Hello!

Oh, nice of you to come! Come on in.

Goku-sa up and left somewhere in the middle of our drive.

What on earth is he thinkin'?

People of the world, this is your king.

As you saw from the broadcast earlier, the full force of our military has suffered a destructive blow from Cell.

I accept full responsibility for this.

I truly am terribly sorry. There was nothing else that could be done.

To be perfectly honest, there is nothing more we can do.

However, please do not fall into panic.

A savior, such as the young man who long ago defeated Piccolo Daimao, may appear once again.

Let us now pray to God.

Pray, he says. Our god is no longer up there.


A New God! The Dragon Balls are Finally Revived"   



Let's see, where is Kaio-sama...?

There he is!

Yo, Bubbles, long time no see. How are you?

Kaio-sama, hey, could you wake up for a minute?

It's me, Son Goku.

Goku?

Oh, Goku. So that's Super Saiyan, huh?

What's up? Are you here out of the blue to kill some time, or something?

Tch, you sure are taking it easy, huh?

Ain't you aware that something awful is happening on Earth?

You don't say.

I see, the Artificial Human Cell, huh?

That certainly is awful.

I have to say, awful things sure do seem to happen around you, one after another.

So I was thinking of finding a Namekian to become the new Kami-sama, and also bring back the Dragon Balls.

It would sure help to know the direction of the planet the Namekians are on.

All right, I'll give it a shot.

I sure do hope I'm able to find them.

Mister Popo seems lonesome, what with Kami-sama gone.

I suppose he would be. I mean, all alone there, at the temple?

Of course he'd be lonesome! And besides--

Put a sock in it! Pipe down! 
I can't concentrate, you know!

Aa...!

Aa ii uu ee oo!

Take this seriously, would you?

Sorry, sorry.

I found them. I found them!
This time, it's for real. This direction.

Really? Thank you!

All right, this way, huh?

Even far away, if I know the direction, I may be able to sense out their Ki.

That's amazing. 
Instantaneous Movement, huh?

When did you manage to learn that move?

Oh yeah, I know.

Instantaneous Movement is the Yardratians' specialty technique.

You had the Yardratians teach it to you, didn't you?

That makes sense. I have to say, that must be handy, huh?

Be quiet, would you?!

That's for earlier.

I did it! This is the Ki!

No doubt about it, this Ki is Namekian.

Thank you, Kaio-sama!

W-What?

Whew! A whole bunch of Piccolos!

G-Grand Elder...

W-Who are you?

U-Um, my name is Son Goku, and I've come from Earth.

Oh! You're the Goku-san who fought Freeza on Namek, and saved us all!

Yeah, but Planet Namek ended up exploding.

Ahem. it would appear that there is a terrible disturbance on Earth.

Huh? You know that Cell is on the rampage?

We don't know anything particular.

We've just felt an evil Ki carrying all the way to our world.

Well, that'll make a long story short.

The truth is, I'm here looking for someone to be our Kami-sama.

A Namekian who can restore our Dragon Balls, so we can bring back to life the people killed by Cell.

It sure would help if one of you would come to Earth with me, and become our Kami-sama.

E-Earth?

I understand. In that case, I have the perfect person for the job.

Really?

Hey, Dende!

Come on over here.

R-Right.

This is Dende.

He is a good friend of your son, Gohan-kun, and Kuririn-san.

Ever since we left, he's been saying that he misses Earth, and that he wants to see Gohan-kun and the others again.

That's great! But he has to be able to do Dragon Balls.

That's all right. Don't let his size fool you.

Dende is an outstanding Dragon-type.

He's sure to make you a fine Kami-sama.

He is? That's great.

Nice to meet you, Dende.

S-Sure. I'm pleased to meet you.

Okay, let's take off, right away.

Right away?!

Thanks.

We'll make sure to take responsibility for Dende and look after him.

Goodbye, everyone!

--Take care.
--Do a good job now, Dende.

Goku-san, we're praying for peace on Earth.

Mm-hmm, thank you.

Kaio-sama, it worked!
This is Earth's new Kami-sama.

Well, see you later.

Hey! I just got back from the new Planet Namek.

D-Dende?!

This person new Kami-sama?

Yeah.

C-Can Dende really serve as Kami-sama?

He'll be fine!

Hold on a second. I'm going to go grab Kuririn and Gohan, okay?

All right...

People of the world, I have terrific news!

The ultra-master of combat sports, our hero, Satan, has decided to enter the Cell Games martial arts tournament!

The super-hero, Satan!

Satan...! Satan...! Satan...!

Hmm? Who's that?

The world champion combat sportsman.

Are you sure about this, Mister Satan?

Your opponent, Cell, is strong enough to wipe out an entire army.

That was nothing but a trick.

He just planted explosives ahead of time.

I could see right away that as far as fighting sports go, he is a rank amateur!

L, Satan, promise you that I will crush that crazy, tinhorn punk!

You hear, people of the Earth?!

Good grief, there's no helping an idiot like that.

Goku-sa! Just where did you go, leavin' us to fend for ourselves?!

Chichi, hold on!

Kuririn, Gohan, come with me.

I brought back our new Kami-sama.

You know Dende, right? The Namekian?

Huh? Dende?

Ah! Gohan-san, Kuririn-san!

It really is Dende!

It's been so long, huh?
I'm so glad you came, Dende!

Say, is it true you're going to be the Earth's Kami-sama?

Y-Yes.

Sure enough. You've always shown a lot of promise.

We'll be able to see each other every day now.

By the way, Dende...

Are you really able to use Dragon Balls?

He'll be fine, I tell you.
The old Namekian guy I talked to said that Dende was an outstanding Dragon-type.

--Old guy?
--H-He means the Grand Elder.

Y-Yeah, the Grand Elder.

He gave you a ringing endorsement, so there's no doubt about it.

I think I can have some Dragon Balls finished in about days.

days?! it's gonna take that long?

I know!

As long as you have the Dragon Balls you used on Earth before, along with a model of the dragon, I can restore them right now.

Really?

The previous ones should be turned to stone and scattered around the world.

We have model of dragon made by Mister Popo.

Great! That's perfect, isn't it?

Hooray!

So, how about it? Can you make it so it grants three wishes,

--like on Planet Namek?
--Yes.

Then can you make it so that with one wish, many people can be brought back to life, like before?

For example,

"Please bring back to life everyone that was killed by Cell."

I-it's not something that I couldn't do with a preliminary adjustment, but the number of wishes that can be granted will drop to two.

Huh? That's all it will take?

Yes.

That will do. Make them so we can do that.

Understood. Well then, the dragon model...

Mister Popo, bring the model out.

Right.

Here. Mister Popo made it.

Wow, what a fascinatingly shaped dragon.

All right, I will try.

Dende, good luck!

Take it nice and easy.

Right!

Tottoratto poppolunga...

Pooral pompo pittenpalo...

Pupa popo tottenpeppo puppipalo poppon pappa...

Parapul pepo!

I believe the scattered stone Dragon Balls have now been restored.

--Huh? Already?
--Impressive!

Nicely done.

He certainly does appear to have outstanding power.

All right, well, I'll go get Bulma to lend me the Dragon Radar, and gather them together.

You do that, Goku.

Yeah. Gohan...you've had enough training, so stay here and play with Dende until the Cell Games.

B-But...

it's okay, it's okay, don't worry.

Goku-san, is it okay if I ask you a question?

Hmm? What?

Goku-san, the reason you're so confident is because you've discovered some weakness that Cell has. isn't that right?

Nope. I doubt he has any weaknesses.

Well, I'm off.

Gohan-san, has he told you anything?

Goku-san has clearly said that Cell is stronger than he is, and that he knows of no weakness.

So then, why is he so cheerful?

Father hasn't told me, either.
He just says I should look forward to it.

Look forward?

You know, if he's telling you to look forward to it, there must be some chance of us winning.

He may have just taken up a so-what attitude.

Oh, Son-kun! Hey, this Artificial Human is one amazing construct.

Doctor Gero may not have been much of a man, but it's clear he was a genius.

Oh, yeah? Anyhow, Bulma, I'd like to borrow your Dragon Radar.

I brought back a new Kami-sama from Planet Namek.

Oh, nice going. Sure, it's in that drawer right there.

Thank you.

Yeah, looks like it's working fine.

Okay, I'm taking it with me.

Hold on!

Rats, I wanted to ask him a little more about Trunks.

Oh, well.

There it is. it really has become a Dragon Ball!

Ee-yow! Ow-w-w-w!

Found the second one.

D-Dad, how did it go?

And so, with everyone following their respective agendas, time passed on.

This is dull. Ten days was too much time.

Whew, I'm finally done.

Not much time left before Cell Games.

Has Goku gathered Dragon Balls?

I've now gotten all seven of them!

Satan! I've been waiting for this!

Show us something good, Satan!

You're the man, Satan!

Satan-sama!

Cell, you're going to regret this!

You're going to share the same fate as this bus!

And so, ten days passed in the blink of an eye, and the Earth was facing its day of destiny.

All right, I'll be off.

You be careful, Goku-sa.

Don't go dyin'.

Yeah, I know.

Gohan-chan isn't fightin', right?

U-Um...

Promise me you won't let Gohan-chan fight.

Well, I'm off!

Ah, hey!

G-Gohan-chan might be fightin', too...

--F-Father...
--There he is.

It's time.

Huh? Where's Vegeta?

He went on ahead.

He did, huh? Vegeta must be pretty revved up.

I'll bet he's gotten even better.

What's wrong, guys?
Why is everybody so down?

Are you nervous?

Goku, something bad has come up.

We had the Dragon Balls set up so that lots of people could be brought back to life with one wish, right?

Yeah.

By doing so, those of us like you and me, who have already died once, can't be brought back to life again.

I'm sorry. I should have said something at the beginning.

Oh, don't worry about it, Dende.
We just have to not die, right?

Not die? This is Cell we're talking about!

It's okay, it's okay. Let's hurry up and go.

12 o'clock is going to come and go.

It's Yamucha-san and Tenshinhan-san!

We're coming, too.

We probably won't take part in the fighting, though.

All right. Come on, everybody.

One hour now remains before the Cell Games!

We are risking certain death to bring you this exclusive live coverage of Cell's countenance before the fight.

Cell is not moving; he is not stirring so much as an inch.


Satan's Legion Runs Wild! The Curtain Rises on the Cell Games"   




Oh, my! Satan is already preparing to enter the ring!

There are still another minutes until it begins, but he is raring to go!

Just what you'd expect from the most depended-upon man in the world!

C-Could he be telling us to come down there?

Th-This is quite... um... well...

A-All right! Let's go!

We are pros, as well! Let's allow everyone to see how brave we are!

Besides, above all else, Mister Satan is down there, so we may rest easy!

P-Please take a close look at this image of overwhelming urgency.

Right now, the bravest announcer in the world is approaching the very ring that will determine the fate of the world!

So, um...

Should we come up into the ring, as well?

I am here with you. Relax.

V-Very well...

W-What do you have to say, Mister Satan?
What is your current mindset?

I feel pity for Cell, as his calculations were so far off.

I doubt he realized that there existed anyone in the world as strong as I am.

After shooting off his big fat mouth like he has, it's too late for him now to even say he's sorry.

Listen to me, Cell! I've long since seen right through you!

The way you destroyed the army from Metro Central was just a big trick using bombs!

But something like that isn't going to work against me!

H-He's pretending he can't hear you.

I've struck him where it hurts, and now he's quaking in his boots!

Well then, let's stick our tongues out at him!

And I'll throw in a fanny-smacking!

Maybe it'd be okay for him to get killed.

And some forehead smack-ums!

H-Huh...?

Is something the matter?

W-What exactly is that?

Vegeta, in spite of everything, you came, after all.

And I bet you've improved your game.

U-Um, an unusual man just appeared.

I-It almost seemed like he flew here...

it's a trick.

He couldn't possibly be thinking of entering the Cell Games, too, could he?

Let's go ahead and ask him.

Um, who might you be?

If you're here to watch, it's awfully dangerous to be so close.

Get lost, and don't ever talk to me again.

That guy is just a bit of a head case, isn't he?

His hairstyle is funny, too.

Those types are more trouble than anything when they get in the way.

Okay, in just five more minutes, with the attention of the world focused on it, the Cell Games, which will decide the Earth's fate, will get underway!

As predicted, the only man here who is prepared to fight Cell is Mister Satan!

But then again, that's only natural.

Mister Satan is the essential combat sports champion.

He alone will be more than sufficient!

I-It seemed like he flew here, too.

He's using tricks, too.

This is a surprise. No. , huh?

Who knew you still existed?

And what's more, your injuries are repaired, aren't they?

Bulma and Bulma's father are the only ones who could have repaired that robot.

Can't they leave well enough alone?

C-Cell just mumbled something, didn't he?

Could he know that man?

Who knows? In any case, he doesn't look so tough.

So you've finally come, Son Goku.

I've been expecting you.

L-Look, up there...

What?

I see them! Down there!

All right, let's go!

Here they come, filing in.

Th-They all looked like they flew here.

I-It looks like that trick is in vogue.

Welcome, all of you.

No.16!

You're all fixed?

I wanted to express my gratitude.

Thank you, Kuririn.
Thanks to you, I'm all better.

Yeah, huh? Good for you.

Good luck to us all.

Son Goku, I was built to kill you.

Do not forget that.

He's sure a gloomy Gus, ain't he?

They're paying me no attention.

Now then...

I think I'll fight him first.

We don't need to lead off with you, Goku-san.

Is that okay, Vegeta?

Suit yourself. Either way, I will be the one who finishes the job.

D-Don't go determining the order all on your own!

U-Um, by any chance, are you fellows planning to fight in the Cell Games?

That's right. Not all of us, though.

That's enough of your horsing around! This is not a game!

You don't understand anything!

You're the one who doesn't understand.

This is a surprise. To think that there are still some ignorant yokels who don't know Mister Satan, the world's number-one combat sportsman!

Mister Satan is the world combat sports title-holding champion!

He is the strongest man in the world!

Goku, it's all right. Let him go first.

No-Okay, sure.

It is time.

I don't care who is first.

Naturally, that's me. Of course it's me.

Don't, Goku. Those guys won't listen to what you say.

I can't do nothing.

You're gonna get killed. if you want my advice, don't do this.

Hey, cameraman, get a shot of that dimwit over there.

Right.

I just heard the voice of all the world in my ears, saying "good grief."

Does this man realize what he just said to Mister Satan?

Of all the things to say!

"You're gonna get killed. if you want my advice, don't do this."

That's what he said!

It's for reasons like this that these amateur bumpkins are such a pain.

After everything that we've told them, they still do not realize who Mister Satan is.

What a pain in the neck these guys are.

--It looks like him.
--Sir?

That man looks like him.

The boy that once upon a time saved us from Piccolo Daimao.

But his eye and hair color were different.

I guess it's not him.

Then again, that man there concerns me.

L-Looking at him, I can't help but think it's Piccolo Daimao.

Look, it's okay. Let the fool do what he wants to.

Even if he's killed, he can come back to life with the Dragon Balls.

Oh, brother, what's the use?

Ah, it looks like they've finally come around.

But then, it's only obvious.

I wonder if he realizes that his life has just been spared.

Mister Satan appeared to be annoyed by that clueless bunch.

He has collected himself, and the match is underway again!

One moment please, Master!

Oh...?

W-What's that?

A mysterious group has shown up before Mister Satan!

Who on earth could they be?

The greatest beauty in the world, Caroni the Swift!

The greatest strongman in the world, Piroshiki the Mighty!

I-It would appear that these two are acquaintances of Mister Satan.

Allow me to explain.

These two are Mister Satan's first and second pupils, and next to the warrior who boasts the greatest speed and power in the world, they are the second-and third-best warriors.

No-ho, that is amazing.

And I am his beautiful manager, Pizza.

Master, there is no need for you to soil your hands over an amateur like this.

Hmm, you may be right.

You take him.

Oh! These two top pupils have clearly declared that they will defeat Cell in Mister Satan's place!

Now there are even more idiots.

And so, the Cell Games, with the fate of the Earth at stake, have now begun!

The rules are simple: if you fall out of the ring, you lose;

If you give up, you lose; And if you die, you also lose.

Are you afraid? Listen, you will only suffer for a brief moment.

Beautiful Rose Flying Attack!!

Whoa, it's a super jump!

I'll finish you in one shot.

W-What exactly happened here?

I-I'm sure he must have just jumped too high.

I will defeat Cell!

S-Such tremendous power!

W-What awesome strength!

Piroshiki won't make the same sort of mistake that Caroni did.

Whoa, Piroshiki launches into a mad dash!

I-I give up!

W-What exactly happened?

A trick.

He's set up tricks inside the ring of combat, as well. The coward!

However, I am going to unveil his tricks!

And so, bearing anger over the foul play dealt to his disciples, Mister Satan once again enters the ring!

He takes off his cape...and now, he has removed his championship belt of honor!

And so, our hero, Mister Satan, at last takes the stage!

This match is to determine the fate of the Earth, and our world combat sports champion, Mister Satan, favored us with a most reassuring comment that he had been looking forward to this day.

Oh? Mister Satan has produced something from his breast pocket.

It is a capsule. He has taken out a capsule.

Oh, it is a bag. A colossal bag has come out of the capsule.

Now then, inside the bag...

Roofing tiles!

There are roofing tiles inside!

Mister Satan is carefully stacking the roofing tiles.

Aw, geez...

Hey, now, you don't suppose...

The number... is an amazing 15! of them!

He has stacked the roofing tiles high!

And now, he focuses himself mentally.

Mister Satan is concentrating his power.

Let's remain quiet for the moment.

And one tile remains!

Still, this is amazing! What devastating power!

tiles! tiles have been smashed to tiny pieces!

Y-Yow-w-w...

That was awesome, Satan!

He's a bona fide idiot.

Cell! Take a look at these shattered tiles!

In one minute... this is how you're going to look.

Satan...! Satan...! Satan...!

It's electrifying! That's our world hero, Satan!

I am now enormously moved!

Nailed it! I just nailed the hell out of it!

Sure enough, I'm glad I set up the machine to record this morning.

He is scared! For all of his big talk, after seeing Mister Satan's devastating force just now, Cell has no choice but to be scared!

However, it's too late for apologies now!

The people of the world will not forgive Cell for his crimes!

All right, bring it!

And now, Mister Satan adopts a total fighting posture!

The world combat sport championship title holder, head and shoulders above the rest, Mister Satan versus Cell!

After taking so many people's lives, the iron fist of justice now bursts forth against Cell!

Now, Mister Satan, if possible, we hope you will beat Cell by killing him!

Ah! There it is! Satan leads off with a huge move!

His Dynamite Kick rips into Cell!

Has this contest already been decided?!

Oh! Satan does not let up on his attacks!

It's a flurry of blows!
Cell receives a flurry of blows!

He is powerless to stop them!

Such strength! Strength beyond strength!

That's our champion, Satan!

--Now to finish you!
--Buzz off.

"Bam!"

--Huh?
--Whew...

To be honest, I was kind of rooting for Cell just now.

Sheesh, he's still alive?

It looks like even Cell is reluctant to kill someone like that.

H-He has landed outside of the ring.

Um... Satan... has lost...

Now, let's hurry up and get the Cell Games started.

Who will go first?

Son Goku, you'd have to go first, right?

Yeah, that's right.

Thanks for waiting.


Decisive Battle! Cell vs Son Goku" 
  



S-Satan, the hope of all mankind, has just lost.

Is it possible that the Earth is now doomed?

M-Mister Satan!

Um, how is it that you lost?

I-I just lost my footing.

Huh? Your... footing?

That's right!

Um... it looked as though you went flying away.

But don't you worry about it.

Once I take a little break, I'll go at him like I mean business!

H-He still doesn't realize how mismatched their levels are?

He's a world champion fool.

Th-The time has come.

Yeah.

All right, let's see it, Kakarrot.

We're going to lead off with you, are we?

I was hoping to save the best for last.

I hear you're able to use all of our moves.

After a fashion.

The mystery is about to be revealed.

The reason why Goku-san has been so unusually confident.

People of the world, please rest at ease.

Mister Satan may have slipped earlier, and landed outside of the ring, but after a short break, he will fight Cell again!

While Satan is taking that break, one of the folks from that clueless bunch who will not heed our warnings appears intent on fighting.

Let's leave him be. Death is the only cure for stupidity, after all.

What are your impressions, Mister Satan, after having observed this nameless contestant?

Absolutely unfit. Just looking at his form and his stance, it's clear that he is an amateur.

And, if he were to face me, I would defeat him in just two seconds.

I can only think that he's utterly crazy.

He probably won't last five seconds against Cell.

Good grief, this won't be much of a break.

There's just no helping folks like this.

Well, without a little sideshow like this, my match won't be quite as thrilling.

Goku is incredible.

Yeah. He's thoroughly on guard.

It's more than just that.

Even at a time like this, when he's facing down Cell, he is taking a natural stance.

You could even say that he's looking forward to this.

Which shows that Goku-san has his Super Saiyan state completely under his control.

Come on!

R-Ringout?!

Did he get him?!

Well? Did you have a slight taste of victory there?

Ha! Don't make it so bald-faced.

I know that there ain't no way you'll be beaten that easily.

You won't show me what you've really got up your sleeve, so I thought I'd try yanking your chain.

And you won't show me what's up yours.

I'll start showing you now, little by little--just how much of a difference there is in our powers.

I can't wait.

You sure seem to enjoy fighting, Son Goku.

You're every bit the Saiyan fighting maniac.

It looks to me like you're the same way.

For me, it depends on the opponent.

Me, too.

Ka...me...ha... me...Ha!!

Why?

Why isn't Father fighting like he means it?

Hmph, I knew it. Kakarrot is just fooling around with Cell.

But then, Cell seems to be doing the same.

Now then, that should be enough warming-up exercise, right?

Yeah.

Th-The full-fledged mortal combat is about to begin.

B-By any chance, was the fight put up by that nameless warrior just now not incredible?

What do you say, Satan-san?

Um, Satan-san...?

A-About that fighting just now?

Ah! N-Not bad, I suppose.

H-He's more capable than I thought, but he seems to be pushing himself pretty hard, and that's all he's got.

Son Goku... He is indeed accustomed to fighting.

He is head and shoulders above the others.

He seems even stronger than I imagined.

If I let my guard down for just a second, he'll wipe me out in the blink of an eye.

All right!

The look in Goku-san's eye has changed.

He's coming at me at full power.

--No-Oh, wow!
--U-Unbelievable!

What power!

I-Impossible!

Y-You mean, his Ki is still rising?!

W-What exactly was that just now?

Just when it appeared that the nameless warrior's body began to glow, suddenly, it was like there was a sort of explosion.

What could this be?

Right now, there is what looks like a golden flame billowing out from the nameless warrior.

Father...

Th-The same thing is now happening to Cell.

It looks like these petty tricks get around.

It's about to start.

They're about to clash with each other at full power.

--Come on.
--Yeah.

Very good, Son Goku. This is what I was after.

Unless our abilities are closely matched, to a certain extent, the fighting just isn't as fun.

Yeah. I think so, too.

Th-That's his true...

Kakarrot's true power now?

I-Incredible. Goku-san is indeed exceptionally incredible.

His Ki really is awesome!
He sure is pouring it on!

Why is everyone so surprised?
Sure, I think it's amazing, but...

Hey, did you get all that?

Please, don't ask the impossible.
I can't follow anything that fast.

N-No, I guess not.

The fighting just now was also at incredible speed, wasn't it, Mister Satan?

Yeah, it wasn't bad.

This should be good, Son Goku.

--W-What?
--Isn't that...?

Shishin no ken!!

W-Why, that rotten...!

You know, this technique ain't gonna work on me.

We'll see.

Damn it, that technique had the drawback of reducing one's power by splitting into four people...

But his power and speed are unchanged from when there was just one of him, isn't it?

Yeah. I hate to admit it, but Cell has mastered that technique even better than I did.

Son Goku, do you now realize the depth of my power?

Yeah. Not bad.

But then, my absolute, ultimate power is more than just this.

I-Is that...?

Tch, now he's using my technique.

Take this!

I've been waiting for this.

For the four of you to split up!

He got him!

Kienzan!!

--That Kienzan!
--He's controlling it like my Soki-dan!

Ha! Freeza's cells tell me that you're going to come right up to me, then duck away at the last moment. However...

...I'm not falling for that trick!

I figured on that, as well.

You ain't gonna beat me with nothing but other people's moves!

You're just acting like a poser.

Perhaps you're right.

Then let me wrap it up with this one...

He's raising his Ki as high as it will go!

W-What is he about to do?!

Ka...me...

Don't do it! As elevated as your power is, if you shoot a Kamehame-Ha...

...ha...

S-Stop!

...me...Ha!!

Up here, Cell!

How? 
Without a doubt, that Kamehame-Ha should have hit you.

Yeah, I couldn't get out of its way.

That's right, you've popped in and out of nowhere before, too.

Instantaneous Movement. I'm able to do it.

Instantaneous Movement? I see.
That move could be a problem.

I wanna ask you something, too.

If I hadn't flown up into the sky, would you still have shot your Kamehame-Ha, and destroyed the Earth?

Well, who knows? Then again, I knew you had no choice but to fly up.

Hmph, so that's it. You're pretty crafty, huh?

I will say this much, though.

I would think nothing of destroying the Earth.

It would just diminish my fun, that's all!

I'm pretty sure of my speed, too.


A Battle of the Highest Level! Defeat Cell, Son Goku"   



Yes. Previous Kami-sama stood there often, taking in tone of Lower Realm.

Like this?

Yes.

No need to strain yourself.

Previous Kami-sama had to train quite hard before gaining firm grasp of Lower Realm.

Relax more. Sense out Ki as if trying to distinguish faint sound.

Goku-san is fighting. It's an incredible fight.

Yes, keep that up.

A-Awesome! They're smoking fast!

W-What... What kind of fight is this?

Goku!

W-Where... Where could the two of them have gone?

You really are not too shabby.

To be honest, I didn't think you would amuse me this much.

Same here.

This is what a fight should be.

Now then, why don't we get going?

Over there!

There, where it's broken!

They're hiding there, using some sort of camouflage-color trick!

Ah, so that's it.

They can use their bizarre tricks, but they can't fool my eyes!

That's our Mister Satan, the greatest combat sportsman in the world!

U-Up there...

They're above us, huh, Mister Satan?

Cameraman! Up! Up!

R-Right!

Hey, what is this? I can't tell what's going on!

Their battle is already beyond what a  TV camera can capture.

I have to say, what terrific speed-- both of them!

F-Father...

L-Look out!

This is a magnificent fight.

I would hate to have this fight end because of an out-of-bounds violation.

Let's remove the out-of-bounds violation from the rules.

There's no point to it for either of us.

What?

What are you planning to do?

Guys! Get away from the ring!

Whoo, that was close.

Th-Thank you very much.

You guys should leave now. You're in the way.

W-We can't very well do that, can we?

A-After all, our Mister Satan is going to fight later.

Right, Mister Satan?

Satan-sama...?

O-Of course I am!

But I think I'll watch from a little bit farther away.

Now, the whole land is our ring.

The match will only be decided by surrendering or dying.

I see. You wanna pull out all the stops, do you?

Such would be appropriate for a fight between you and me.

All right.

Now then, what do you say we allow ourselves to use all of this space right away?

I-Incredible!

It's not just their speed, it's their power, too.

Neither side is giving any ground!

G-Goku? What are you planning to do way up there?

Ka... me...

A Kamehame-Ha!

Is Goku thinking of launching a Kamehame-Ha at full power?!

You can't shoot a Kamehame-Ha from up there!

If you do, it will mean a disaster for the Earth!

H-He's not gonna shoot it.
If he shoot from where he is, it's gonna destroy the whole Earth.

...ha... me...

H-Hey...!

F-Father is going to shoot it!

Y-You wouldn't!

Oh, crap!

...Ha!!

G-Goku...

A-Amazing. What just happened?

H-He got him! He got him!

That's right! He has his Instantaneous Movement!

Hey, he got him! Goku has finally won!

W-What's wrong? Aren't you guys happy?

Mister Satan, it looks like he's taken care of Cell.

Mister Satan!

Y-Yeah. Well, he did pretty good.

I have to say, though, that's too bad.

I wanted to be the one to defeat him.

It truly is a shame, Mister Satan, not being able to show off your elegant, graceful, and powerful techniques to the entire world, huh?

Y-Yes.

P-People of the world, I truly regret to inform you that before Mister Satan was able to make his graceful reappearance, the unnamed young man has defeated Cell.

I-Is it all over now?

That was surprisingly anticlimactic.

Hey, Mama, isn't Mister Satan going to come on again?

It doesn't look like it.

What's going on here?

Even in the state he's in, he still has plenty of Ki remaining.

Be careful, Goku!

Cell is probably going to come back around!

What?!

What?! What?! Cell's lower half just stood up!

He's alive again! Cell has come back to life!

Is this a trick as well, Mister Satan?

O-Of course it's a trick!

Come to think of it, you're able to regenerate, ain't you?

That is correct. Just like Piccolo.

Damn you...

Tch, no wonder I thought you went down too easily.

But you just spent quite a bit of your Ki, even for you.

That goes for both of us.
You're breathing pretty hard yourself.

Now, let's keep going.

I should warn you, I won't fall for the same trick again, so don't waste your strength trying and making this fight dull.

I know!

Do you?

Once again, the fighting has intensified!

Cell strikes ferociously, and the nameless warrior strikes back!

It's shaking! The very ground we're standing on is shaking!

Just what is going to unfold next?!

For some reason... Goku is...

Hello!

Oh, Bulma?

Yeah, you've got it on, all right.

I figured that rather than watching alone, I'd understand better

if someone like you could explain it to me, so here I am.

Oh, there, there. What's the matter, Trunks?

Both of them used up quite a bit of power on that Kamehame-Ha earlier.

And yet, imagine, still being able to carry on this kind of fighting!

What's wrong, Goku? Is that all you've got?

Damn it!

Oh, he's got him!

It's working! Way to go, Goku-san!


Conclusion to the Death Match! Time for Goku's Decision"  




Way to go, Goku! You're one step away!

You're one step away from defeating Cell!

He's winning! Goku is winning!

--Goku-san!
--He's got him!

Goku!

F-Father...

What?!

Son Goku, your attack deserves some credit for making me raise this barrier.

I've taken a surprising amount of damage.

A-Awesome...

Y-Yeah. I don't know what that is, but it's incredible.

H-Hey, Mama, is this not a movie?

Dear, that man's the one who married Chichi, isn't it?

Remember, she said recently that he was dyein' his hair?

Y-Yeah. It does look like him.

Come to think of it, he is always wearin' those loud outfits, huh?

Somebody must be talkin' about me.

Goku-sa, hang in there!

Aw, he was so close!
He was just one step away!

If only it was one step.

Sure, it may look like he's putting up a good fight, but unlike Goku, Cell still has some breathing room.

A-Are you sure?

I hate to say it, but Goku can't win.

What's more, it looks to me like Goku is fighting him well aware of that fact.

I don't know what's in his mind.

It looks like your strength has fallen off quite a bit, Son Goku.

You should have one of those senzu beans.

This could once again be an outstanding match.

I-It's our chance!

Let's give Goku-san a senzu, like he says, and then, if we all gang up on him, we're sure to be able to defeat Cell now!

Yeah! That's a good idea!

Kuririn-san!

Kuririn-san, quick, a senzu--

Shut your mouth, Trunks!

Apparently, you have no Saiyan pride.

He would probably choose death rather than win in such a fashion.

Listen! He is not fighting for Earth's sake right now.

Remember that well!

B-But if he keeps this up...

He's going to get finished, without a doubt.

I-It pains me to admit this, but even after all the training I did this time, I still wasn't able to surpass Kakarrot.

The bastard has a real gift.

But Cell is still a step or two above even Kakarrot there.

Then what are we supposed to do?

Just sit on our hands and watch?

You said yourself that he has to have some sort of strategy, right?

Just hope that he does.

Goku-san...

Just what sort of strategy do you have in mind?

What's the matter? Is your pride preventing you from using a senzu?

I've lost considerable strength right now.

If you reach full power now, then the possibility of you winning, slim though it may be, would increase.

I want to enjoy fighting with you more and more!

I give up!

I concede.

Cell, I now know just how strong you are.

I'm throwing in the towel.

W-What?!

--You concede?!
--Th-That can't be!

G-Goku is giving up?!

Has that ever happened before?!

What is he thinking?!

F-Father...

Why?! Why would Son-kun, who has never been one to say die, now just give up?!

C-Concede?

U-Unbelievable.

You concede?

Son Goku, are you thinking of bringing an end to this fight?

That's right. I lose.

W-What did that man say?

Going by the microphone, he clearly said he conceded.

Son Goku! Do you know what that word means for you?!

--Yeah.
--If there is no one left to fight in the Cell Games, every last person on Earth will be wiped out by my hand!

Cell! Don't go getting the wrong idea!

It's not like there ain't nobody left to fight, is it?

It's the same difference!

As for Vegeta, Piccolo, and Trunks, regardless of how much power they've gained, they're still inferior to you.

They are no match for me!

Okay, Mister Satan, your turn has come around again!

You've had plenty of time to rest.

Now, this time, please be sure to smack that guy down but good!

Satan-sama, have an elegant fight!

Yes, Master!

Yeah... I guess I should go scare the wits out of him.

M-Mister Satan...?

Damn it, ow-w-w-w!

I-I want to fight! I could take him, except... ah-h-h-h...

my stomach... ow-w-w-w...!

Well, can I nominate the next person to fight you?

You really are serious about conceding?

What does he think he's doing?

There's no one else who can beat Cell!

The Cell Games will probably come to an end after the next fighter.

If he loses, then there ain't anyone else who can beat you.

But I've just become convinced that he will definitely defeat you.

What?

That's why I've conceded and am leaving everything to him.

What you're telling me is that he's stronger than me, to say nothing of you, is that it?

Yeah.

Ridiculous! There is no one stronger than me in the whole world!

Oh, but there is.

Then let's hear it! What is the name of this nonexistent person?

H-He's about to give the name.

A-All right...

H-He's planning to say "Mister Satan."

--Hey...
--Yes?

Go tell him for me that I have a stomachache now and can't fight.

You're up next, Gohan!

W-What?!

That idiot! Is he trying to get his son killed on purpose?!

You're joking. Of all the names for you to say, it's Son Gohan?

H-He says it's time for gohan ["a meal"].

So that's it. He's saying they're going to take a break, and have themselves a bento lunch, or something.

That's pretty happy-go-lucky at a time like this.

Goku-sa, what are you thinkin'?!

Y-You're makin' Gohan-chan...

You're makin' Gohan-chan fight that terrible monster?!

--What are you thinkin'?!
--C-Calm down, Chichi!

Gohan! Gohan!

You're up to it, right, Gohan?

M-Me, take on Cell?

Don't be crazy, Goku!
There's no way he can fight him!

Sure, Gohan's abilities have risen beyond all recognition, but he'll be facing Cell, who not even you could handle!

Piccolo, Gohan has an unbelievable kind of power, more than we ever thought.

Just think about it. 
From the time he was just a little kid, he's been fighting right alongside us, hasn't he?

Back when I was his age, I wasn't nothing to write home about.

Y-Yeah, but even if he has turned Super Saiyan, this is kind of sudden. 
You know?

When we were in the Room of Spirit and Time, his dormant power, which is locked away deep, deep down inside, started to be released.

How about it, Gohan?

Did you think that the fighting between your dad and Cell was so incredible, you couldn't keep up with it?

N-No, I didn't.

After all, Father, you and Cell weren't fighting all-out, right?

I don't know about Cell, but your dad was giving it his all.

My point is, to you, it looked like we were holding back, right?

I-Is that true, Gohan?!

--Yes.
--W-What?

That fight? Impossible! A kid like that?

Get him, Gohan. Go win back peace for the world.

You want to be a scholar, right?

All right. I'll try.

G-Gohan...

Well now, what exactly is going on?

They say they're going to eat lunch, and yet, another unnamed young man has stepped forward.

I get it! That boy is the box lunch vendor!

Oh, ow-w-w-w...

So that's it.

Since it's mealtime, this young bento vendor has come forward.

He's a bento vendor! A bento-vending young boy has appeared!

G-Gohan?

Hmm... However strong Gohan may have gotten, I doubt he can compete with Cell.

Kuririn, you've got the senzu, right?
Can I have one?

S-Sure.

Thank you.

Cell! Here!

That's a senzu bean. Eat up.

Y-You idiot, Goku! What do you think you're doing?!

What's the harm? He's consumed much of his strength.

It wouldn't be fair to let Gohan beat him like that.

W-What are you saying?! This is no time to worry about being fair!

You fool. You're trying to come off as too heroic.

Apparently, you don't realize that your mercy will cost you your lives.

I will accept this senzu without any hesitation.

Son Goku! You are immediately going to regret doing this!

D-Damn it!

Indeed, these are nice.

D-Don't blame me, whatever happens!

Goku, what you're doing is foolhardy by any estimation!

Gohan...!

Th-That's Gohan? Our meek little Gohan?

Th-That kid... How did he get such a massive battle power?

It seems that what Son Goku said wasn't entirely a put-on.

But it also seems he still went a bit too far when he claimed that you could beat me.

You impudent little brat.
You really are up for this, huh?

But then, this might be fortunate for you.

After all, the moment you experience true terror, you're going to wind up dead.

Attaway, Gohan!

G-Gohan...

Gohan-san...

You're a spry little runt.

Well, let me raise my speed up to its true level.

--G-Gohan! Gohan-chan! Stop that!
--Ch-Chichi! Hey, Chichi!

It was reckless, all right!

G-Goku!

Goku-san!

Hey, Goku! Hey...!


Get Angry Gohan! Release Your Dormant Power"   



Hmph, your struggle is a foolish one, Son Gohan.

G-Gohan...

Gohan!

Gohan-chan!

There's nothin' I can do about Goku-sa.

Up to now, he's always been neglectful of me, and gone off fightin' on his own.

I've already given up on him.

But... Gohan-chan, at least...

How many times did I tell him not to let him fight?

Gohan! Don't go fightin' that monster!

--Gohan! Gohan-chan!
--Chichi, calm down!

You little brat!

For some reason, the boy we believe to be the bento vendor is fighting!

However, Cell overwhelmingly has the upper hand!

All the boy can do is flee from him!

Should they be letting that child fight?!

I-It's crazy! This is messed up!

If this keeps up, Gohan will be...

Gohan-san!

Son Gohan, if you have to blame someone, blame your father for roping you into this foolhardy battle.

Gohan!

G-Gohan-san!

Brutal!

Perhaps I overdid that a little.

It's not like me to act so immature.

H-How could this have happened?

The boy bento vendor has recklessly challenged Cell...

...a-and has lost his young life!

Chichi! Stay strong!

Goku!

This is your fault! You completely misread the situation!

We all advised you against this!

Goku, you are the one who killed Gohan!

Don't lose your cool, Piccolo.

Gohan's Ki ain't dropped in the least, right?

You're right!

Come, Son Goku.
Your ridiculous joke is at an end.

Take one of those senzu, and fight me once again.

You dummy! Take a good look behind you!

What?!

Ah! Gohan-san!

You're really something else, Gohan!

This is a surprise. You're actually quite tough, aren't you?

L-Let's stop this, already.
There's no point to this fighting.

Have you lost your nerve, kid?

Of all the things to say, you want to end the Cell Games because they're pointless?

--Mm-hmm.
--They do have a point.

This is a pastime for me.

After I defeat you, I will take my time in killing all of humanity.

For you, the point is to save the Earth.

I really don't want to fight.

I don't want to kill you. Not even someone as evil as you are.

I don't enjoy fighting the way that Father does.

What is Gohan saying? His voice is so low, I can't make it out.

W-What is your microphone picking up?

I-I can't understand a thing.

I can understand that you don't like to fight.

But I don't understand what you mean when you say you don't want to kill me.

You couldn't kill me in a hundred years.

What do you say? Am I wrong?

I've slowly come to realize what Father meant when he said that I was the only one who could defeat you, Cell.

You? Defeat me?

Ever since I was little, when I lost my temper, things would happen that not even I understood.

The first time I realized it happened was when the Saiyan Raditz arrived from outer space to attack us.

Father...

Go on, go on, suffer some more!

Stop picking on my father!!

Then, when Piccolo-san was training me...

No way. I don't have that kind of power.

What are you doing?!

--I'll show you!
--That hurts! That hurts!

Now, show me your inner power!

W-What the...?!

A-Astonishing. It's greater than I imagined.

When I went to Planet Namek, and fought against Freeza...

Kuririn-san!

You think you can save him?

It's no use. He'll be dead soon.

Move... Move...

Move...

Move it!!

When I snap, I seem to overstep my own will and start fighting like mad, with an unheard-of power.

And now, after training in the Room of Spirit and Time, I've powered myself up.
Father must have figured on that.

But if it comes to that, I am positive that I will kill you.

What a fascinating tale.

You blew it.

Did you think that by telling me that, you would intimidate me?

You really are a punk kid.

On the contrary, now I want to do whatever it takes to get you mad.

I want to see this hidden power of yours!

Come on, come on, come on, come on! Well?!

G-Gohan-san!

Goku! Put a stop to this! If you go in and fight in Gohan's place,

Cell will let Gohan go!

Goku!

It's all right! Gohan can win!

Get angry, Gohan. Get angry!

Get angry! Get angry, and show me your true power!

Get angry!

Get angry! Get angry! Get angry!

The boy bento vendor is getting pummeled!

Cell is delivering a savage one-sided beating!

Will the boy be able to get out of this tight situation?!

What do you think, Mister Satan?

It's not possible. Not for that boy bento vendor.

If someone doesn't get in there and fight for him...

Oh! Then Mister Satan, you're going to take his place?

People of the world, it looks like we're going to be able to see

Mister Satan's fighting elegance once again!

Yow-ow-ow-ow... My stomach has started hurting again!

Ee-yow-ow-ow-ow...

U-Unfortunately, Mister Satan's stomachache seems to have returned.

Will the boy bento vendor be left to his fate like this?!

Is there no one who can save him?!

Come on, get angry! Get angry and show me your true power!

Oh! Cell has been knocked on his can!

Son Gohan, I will get you angry, no matter what it takes.

That's it, Cell. That's what I want.
Get Gohan mad at you.

Once you do that, you will get a taste of some real terror.

Son Gohan, I will see this so-called hidden power of yours.

Ah! That's the technique that Freeza used!

Well, what will it be?
This hurts, right? Get angry.

You don't want to die like this, do you?

Damn it! Gohan!

Well, how about it? What are you waiting for?

Your bones are about to break.

I doubt you dislike fighting so much that you'd rather put up with this.

Oh! The boy is being put through the wringer!

What monstrous strength! Will he give up?

What will the future of the Earth be? What is our fate?

Damn it...

I-I can't take it anymore!

Goku, I don't care what you say, I'm going to go help Gohan!

Wait, Piccolo! Frankly speaking, you ain't no match for him!

A little longer. Just wait a little longer.

Wait, you say? What are you telling me?

To just wait for him to get killed like this?!

Wait for Gohan to get angry.

--What?
--Once he releases his true strength through his anger, he should start displaying some fearsome strength.

There's only one way to defeat Cell, and that's to pin our hopes on Gohan's power!

W-What? The kid has that much power?

Get angry. Aren't you there yet?

This must hurt. Your anger has to be welling up inside.

Goku, you're making a mistake!

Gohan doesn't like fighting the way you do.

Does Gohan know what your strategy is?
Did you discuss this with him?

Do you know what Gohan is thinking right now?

It's not about getting angry. He's thinking,

"Why, when I'm suffering to death like this, won't Father save me?

Is fighting a fair fight more important to him than my life?"

Don't forget! Even if his strength does rank number one among us, he is still just a child!

I don't care if it does kill me! I'm going in!

Kuririn! Let me have a senzu!

Yeah!

You're a stubborn one. It would appear that your own pain alone is not enough to call up your anger.

Well then, I think I'll take it up with your friends.

Stop!

Your senzu beans are in here, right?

I'll just take them, since they could prove to be trouble.

O-Oh, no!

Damn!

There's hardly any need for me to take on the likes of them.

W-What are you planning to do?!

Oh, I'll do whatever it takes, if you'll show your true power.

But you seem to be unusually capable of holding your temper, so now your friends are going to get hurt.

D-Don't do it! I can't control it, even if I want to! That's why...

That's why I'm offering to hurt your friends and draw that power of yours out for you.

Watch yourselves!
He's planning to do something!

D-Damn!

I should have taken a senzu earlier!

Darn you!

If you're going to get mad, then really blow your top!

N-No.16 !

Oh! Another man has just appeared!

Will he end up being the savior of the Earth?!

No.16 !

He's a robot, so he doesn't give off any presence to be noticed!


The Tears that Disappeared into the Sky! The Angry Super Awakening of Gohan"   


I have a powerful self-destruct device installed within me.

It is my final, hidden power.

Forgive me for bringing you down with us, and claiming you as casualties, as well!

Cell! I don't care how strong you are, at this close range, you'll be blown to pieces!

Mama!

W-What happened?

W-Why?

Why didn't I explode?

N-No. ...

You... can't self-destruct!



I heard it from Bulma-san. The doc--

Dr. Briefs removed the bomb that was hidden inside your body!

I-Is that true, Bulma?

A-At the time...

Oh? What's this?

Bulma, would you do a blow-up scan of this area near the heart?

Sure thing.

It looks like a self-destruct device.

And it's no ordinary bomb, either.

It could just blow up the entire Earth.

Is that right?

Doctor Gero stuck something like that inside No.16's body, did he?

I'll bet it was to defeat Son-kun.

Hmm... I'm sure it must have been his last resort.

It's too dangerous. We should remove it.

So then...

...my dad went and took it out of him.

No.16! You can't self-destruct!

That's a shame, No.16.

But then, I doubt a mere bomb would be enough to kill me.

No.16!

No.16, it looks like you really are one of Doctor Gero's failed creations.

Well, is there anyone else who wants to come at me?

D-Damn it all!

Son Gohan, it looks like your heart still isn't in this.

But I will make you angry, no matter what it takes.

Seven in all, huh? All right...

W-What is he planning to pull this time?

W-What are those things?!

Even more strange characters have made an appearance!

Seven of them in total!

Just what are these unusual creatures that have emerged from Cell's back?

What are they?

Look how many there are!

How disgusting!

W-What are those things?!

Now, my Cell Juniors, the seven people up on that rock are your foes. 
Rough them up.

You may even kill them, if you like.

Go!

Watch yourselves!
These guys are terribly strong!

Hmph! These small fry?!

It's no use. There's no way you can beat them.

They may be small, but they are my children.

--Oh, no!
--D-Damn it!

D-Damn you!

Over here!

Th-The unnamed combatants are fighting against the seven newly arrived monsters!

The fighting is so intense that it is unclear what exactly is going on, b-but in any event, it appears to be frantic!

Mister Satan, how about it?

You seem to have recovered from your stomach trouble.

Yow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

W-What are you talking about?!

I just haven't said anything more about it up to now!

Ah, you don't say.

It's only because it's me that I can withstand this agony!

A normal person would have passed out long ago!

Oh, as one would expect of Mister Satan!

Um, your stomachache...

Yow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

Uh, should I go get some medicine?

Hush! You keep quiet!

G-Goku!

Tenshinhan! Yamucha!

Goku used up all of his strength fighting Cell!

Go help Goku out!

Yamucha!

Th-Thank you...

Heh, this is no time for manners, you know.

Piccolo!

Kuririn-san!

S-Stop...! Except for Trunks-san, no one can be brought back to life again with the Dragon Balls!

Oh? Your Ki is starting to flare up just a little.

Good. It looks like you're finally starting to feel anger.

Hurry up and show me your true power, or there will be no undoing what happens.

Take a good look. 
Vegeta and Trunks are barely evenly matched.

With his strength gone, Son Goku is also in danger.

What strength! 
To think that I'd be challenged by this runt!

Damn you!

G-Guys, I'm sorry...

I-It wasn't... It wasn't supposed to happen like this...

E-Everyone is going to be killed...

If there really is some terrific power hidden within me, I want to release that power!

I want to defeat Cell with that power!

But how can I?

I don't know how to get angry enough to release that power!

Why, you...!

You think I have time to deal with a guppy like you all day?!

Get out of my sight!

Damn you!

We should get out of here while we're still alive.

Those guys aren't human.

Y-You may be right. 
Any longer than this and we're pushing it.

Let's pull out of here, while we still can.

M-Mister Satan, we should get out of here, too.

Ridiculous! 
Why should I, the champion, have to run away?

S-So then, we're staying here, where we are?

Well, after I stop in at the hospital for a bit and recover from my stomachache, we're coming back here.

All right! With that decided, let's go!

W-Wait!

Wait a second.

P-Please...

Before you leave here, carry me over to where the child is.

It's just a head, and it's talking!

P-Please... for the sake of the Earth...

Y-You've got to be kidding!
Cell is right next to that child!

Absolutely right!

How can you ask Mister Satan to go somewhere that dangerous?!

Y-You want to be of some help, too, don't you?

W-Word is that you're the world combat sports champion, and all.

M-Mister Satan is the champion of mankind!

He can't afford to involve himself in a fight among monsters like you!

Don't be absurd! 
Whether they're monsters or not, they're still no match for me!

I just have to go to the hospital first.

Please, champion...

Come on, Mister Satan!

There's no need to concern yourself with those monsters!

She's right! Let's hurry up and go!

We have to get you to a hospital!

Mister Satan!

All right, I'll do it!

You'd best not! You'll be killed!

You be quiet!

Those guys whose names we don't even know, and even that child, are fighting!

I'd be a laughingstock of a champion if I ran away!

Mister Satan...

I-I just need to carry you close to him, right?

Yeah. Thanks.

This is terrifying, all right!

Once you get close enough, you can toss me the rest of the way.

O-Oh, really?

S-Stop!

I'm begging you to stop, aren't I?

He just needs one last push now.

All right, my Cell Juniors!
That's enough fooling around!

You're free to kill them, if you like!

Good... A little more... a little more...

Do it! kill them!

All right, here goes...

N-No. -san?

O-Oh, no! I threw him too hard!

S-Son Gohan...

It is no sin to fight for what is right.

There are some people that words will not reach.

Give your inner self over freely to your anger.

I know how you feel, but there's no reason to hold it in.

That's good advice.

But I'm doing this the way I want this done.

Gohan...

I-I, too, loved the animals, and other elements of nature...

Protect them for me...

Please...

Nobody asked you, you factory reject.

Gohan...?


Fighting Spirit Free from Hesitation! Gohan, Pulverizes the Cell Juniors" 


W-What?!

I-Is that...?

G-Gohan's Ki is rising!

G-Gohan...

Good, Gohan.

Is that all?

You've made the same mistake that Trunks made.

You cannot beat me simply by raising your power.

Stop.

Stop!

I told you to stop!

Th-That's it. That will do nicely.

H-He's changed.

Those guys are all monsters!

Chichi!



I'm not putting up with any more from you guys.

You're finally showing me your true power, are you?

Now things are going to get interesting.

I-Impossible!

Y-You took the senzu?

Why, you...!

W-With one blow, he finished one of these little runts who gave us so much trouble?

I-Incredible. That was incredible, Gohan-san!

I-I knew it...

G-Gohan...?

W-What?

H-He's fast!

What speed! He's as fast as Cell--no, maybe even faster.

G-Gohan, never mind about me.
B-Blow these guys away!

Get him, Gohan!

U-Unbelievable. How is this possible?

So, that's the power of his anger, is it?

Hmph, fine. Let's get a good long look at it.

H-He sent those Cell Juniors flying with just a battle cry!

W-What's more, after fighting that hard, he isn't the least bit winded.

Are you all right, Goku?

Yeah.

What do you think, Piccolo?
It's just like I told you, huh?

Gohan...

H-He can win... He just might be able to win!

People of the world, listen and be amazed!

The boy is fighting valiantly against the miniature Cells!

Follow him closely. Don't miss a second!

I can't. It's broken.

What?! This is the scoop of the century!

You're a pro; fix it somehow!

I'm not the big star. This is absurd.

The program I set to record is going to be wasted.

Is this the kind of thing I want out there in the world?

No, it's not!

W-What? What's goin' on?

Ch-Chichi, you're awake?

Pa, where's Gohan?
What's become of my Gohan-chan?

Just as he was doin' a fine job of fightin', the picture cut out.

A fine job, my foot! You've gotta be kiddin'!

I'm goin' to give Goku a real earful!

Just hush, Chichi!

Gohan is not a child. 
Right now, he's a great warrior, even better than Goku, and he's defendin' the Earth!

Your husband and son are fightin' for everyone, and for the sake of peace in this world!

Why can't you understand that?!

To tell you the truth, I wanna fight, too, but right now, Gohan is the only one who can defeat Cell!

Okay? Try to understand. Just be still, and pray for Gohan's safety.

Is that all, then?

Is that all you've got to say?

Ch-Chichi...

Pa, you're so naive!

Savin' the Earth don't mean he's gettin' into a good school!

It's not goin' to make him a great scholar!

He can beat Cell, but he'll lose out there in a competitive world!

H-Hold on, Chichi! Just calm down!

You be quiet!

What's so great about keepin' hold of Gohan now that he's gone delinquent?!
Goku-sa, you dummy!

Give me back my Gohan-chan!

I told you, I wasn't going to take it any more from you guys!

Don't get too carried away!

There's no more hesitation, nor any tentativeness anymore.

He is the ultimate warrior, whose feelings are governed by anger.

Serves you right, Cell.
You've really blown it now.

Get these to everyone.

Right.

K-Kuririn-san... Kuririn-san!

Thank goodness; he's still breathing.

Trunks...

H-How's Gohan?

He's amazing. I've never seen Gohan-san like this.

Is that Gohan?

I-Incredible. What on earth happened to him?

Could that be what Goku was talking about?

I-It looks that way.

Okay, everyone, please hurry and vacate the area.

I will go deliver senzu beans to Goku-san and Piccolo-san.

--Quickly!
--Y-Yeah.

Come on.

Too slow!

M-Mess with me, will you?!

C-Cell's attacks aren't landing.

Hmph, so that's it, huh?

Goku, I now understand the reason why you fought him first.

You wanted to show Gohan how Cell fights. Am I wrong?

Is that true?

It's Cell!

P-People of the world, my camera may be broken, but is my voice making it through to you, at least?

Right now, Cell and the boy bento vendor are locked in a life-or-death battle right before my eyes!

S-Such a pro.

Yes! However, I will not move!

What courage I have as an announcer!

U-Um, your mic...

H-Huh? How did...?

Just what is going on?

Isn't it obvious?

Is there anyone except for Satan who can defeat Cell?

Which would mean that since Satan lost...

Is this the end of the world?

This is the end. It has to be.

O-Oh, no!

Hey, Piroshiki! What are you doing?!

If you stay there, you'll be caught in the crossfire!

I-I'm too scared to move!

Is he still down there? That fool!

Doesn't he know that unless he's a fighting pro like me, he can't stay in a place like this?

Take this!

W-When did he manage to...

I-Impossible!


The Perfect Form Breaks Down! explosion, the Super Iron Fist of Rage" 
  


Attaboy, Gohan.

Thanks to you, Gohan can see through all of Cell's moves.

That ain't got nothing to do with it.

Gohan has completely eclipsed Cell.

What?

Gohan's rocking, huh?

Yeah.

With Gohan the way he is, he might be able to beat Cell.

W-Why, that little...!

To think that there's someone other than Kakarrot who has surpassed me!

Dad...

Here's a senzu.

Tch, I have to rely on one of these again?

Damn...

Don't let it go to your head, kid.

You don't seriously think that you can defeat me, do you?

Yeah, I can.

Hmph, that's a pretty big boast.

Then why don't I show you...

...the true, terrible power of Cell.

Th-That monster!

G-Gohan...

Th-This is impossible!

I-Is there no end to his power?!

Th-The whole Earth is shaking!

C-Cell is finally going to let us see him fight at full power, huh?

What do you think, now that I've gotten down to business?

What's the big deal?

H-He's fast!

His power isn't the only thing that's increased!

His speed has gone up, too!

I-Impossible...

H-How, after all of just two punches...

...could I take this much damage...?

A-Awesome... What power...!

He's been concealing how much difference there is between them.

W-Why, you...!

Stop mocking me!

I-I refuse to let this happen!
I am perfect-form Cell!

There's no way I can lose to the likes of that Saiyan kid!

I am the ultimate creature--the best in every way!

Kienzan!!

Take this!

Why, you...!

Take this!

I-I won't let...

I won't let this happen!

Imagine, him being able to outmatch someone like Cell this badly.

I-It's unbelievable, huh?

Gohan...

I-I can't believe it.

Who knew that there was anyone in the world like him?

He's completely overshadowed my level of power.

Is this what fear is?

Ka...me...ha...

Th-That bastard...!

...me...

Take this! My full-power Kamehame-Ha!

If you evade it, the Earth will be blown away!

You have no choice but to receive it!

You've gotta be joking! Don't do it!

...Ha!!

I-It's all over!

Ka...me...ha...me...Ha!!

What?!

It's... pushing... back...!

That pipsqueak pushed back Cell's ridiculously huge Kamehame-Ha with an even larger Kamehame-Ha.

I'm sensing his Ki.

Cell is still alive!

That's impossible.

He's surpassed me, all right.

He's been beyond the Super Saiyan barrier ever since back then.

This is good, Gohan.

You're starting to control your Ki fairly well.

W-Whoops! I didn't mean to hit him so hard!

Come on, Gohan, let's call it a day.

We've been at it for about hours straight now.

Father...

Are we done already?

H-His Ki is awesome! His is way past mine!

You've surpassed me, and now you've beaten Cell. 
You've done good.

H-How...? How can he have that much power...?

Gohan! Finish it! Hurry up and finish him off!

Finish him already?

It's still too soon, Father. I have to make him suffer more first.

W-What did you say?

What is he talking about?

Gohan...

Gohan! You're the only one who can finish Cell off! Hurry up and do it!

Don't push him any further!
There's no telling what he'll do!

D-Damn it...

Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

Damn it!!

Th-There's no way that my...

There's no way that my perfect form can be beaten by you!

Why, you little...!

He's so focused on power that his speed is suffering.

Cell himself is committing the same error that I did.

He's gone berserk!

W-What's this?!

Something about Cell is changing!

It couldn't be...

That's it, all right.

Cell's Ki has started falling off sharply.

It's just as I thought. He can no longer stay in his perfect form.

What exactly do you mean?

Th-That's...!

It's No.18! He's spit out No.18!

The Artificial Human that Cell swallowed!

That's it for him.

--No.18!
--Wait!

What is it? What's happening?

C-Cell's body has reverted!
He's no longer in his perfect form!

Gohan has won. Cell is no longer any match for him.

Damn it!

Tch, this is no fun.

You've had it now.

Y-You'll pay!

You'll pay for this!

W-What is this? What's he planning to do?

This is bad!

This is the end for you!


Bye-Bye Everyone! This is the Only Way to Save the Earth" 



I'm going to blow myself up in mere moments!

I may die, but you're all going to die, too!

I'm going to take the entire Earth with me!

--What?!
--W-What?! He's blowing himself up?!

I won't let you do that!

Whoa! You'd best not attack me!

Any impact on me will cause me to explode at that instant!

You'll just bring about your deaths that much sooner!

One more minute! Not even I can stop it now!

I-It can't be...

W-What do we do? We have to do something!

I-It's no use. There's nothing we can do now.

30 seconds!

Gohan! You're the only one who can finish Cell off! Hurry up and do it!

Don't push him any further!
There's no telling what he'll do!

W-Who knew it would end up like this? Father was right.

Darn it...

Darn it... Darn it...!

This is my fault.

If I'd only finished Cell off sooner...

Th-Thirty seconds...

Th-The Earth will be gone! Damn it all!

W-What, Goku?

Sure enough, no matter how hard I think about it, I can't come up with any other way to save the Earth.

What do you mean, Goku?

Goku-san!

Bye-bye, everyone.

Goku... You're not thinking of...

Ten more seconds!

This fight has ended in a draw!

Darn it!

Goku!!

You've done well, Gohan.

F-Father...?

Tell your mom for me that I'm sorry.

I've always done whatever I wanted to.

Goodbye, Gohan.

Father!

Goku!!

Y-You idiot! Don't bring that guy here!

Sorry, Kaio-sama! This was the only place!

Don't give me that!

Damn it!!

G-Goku's Ki-- it's gone...

Goku!

Father!!

W-What exactly has happened?

C-Cell is not here. Cell and that man suddenly disappeared.

M-Mister Satan, what was that?

It's over, Gohan. You and Goku brought it to an end.

I-It's my fault. If I'd only done as Father told me to back then, I could have killed Cell.

But I got carried away with myself...

Gohan, don't be so hard on yourself.

The Earth could not have been saved without your power.

Isn't that right?

Goku died with a contented look on his face.

I'm sure he was glad to see you all grown up.

Come on, get up.

Let's go home.

No.18 ...

Father...

Sorry about that, Bubbles and Gregory.

You guys got dragged into this, too.

I simply cannot believe what you just did!

I am Kaio, you know! I'm the greatest being in the world!

I'm even higher than Kami-sama!

And yet... And yet...

...you exploited me for the sake of Earth-- just one planet!

I've said I'm sorry, over and over, haven't I?

Kaio-sama, you're such a nag.

I told you, I couldn't think of any other way!

Goku! You watch your tongue!
Who do you think you're calling a nag?!

R-Right...

Then again, Kaio-sama, I don't see Cell's soul anywhere.

Could he have gone straight to Hell or somewhere?

N-Now that you mention it...

H-He's gone! He's nowhere!

Whenever someone dies, no matter who they are, their soul first goes to Yama's place.

What does that mean?

C-Cell isn't dead yet.

He's still alive!

What?!

Kuririn, what do you plan to do with that Artificial Human?

If she's still alive, kill her, quick.

I couldn't. 
She's... No.18 here isn't such a bad person.

Hmph, I wouldn't be too sure.

W-What?!

Th-That Ki...!

I-It couldn't be!

O-Oh, no!

Who was it that I hit? Trunks, was it?

How?! How can this be?!

Cell is still alive?!

What do you mean, Kaio-sama?!

We know he blew himself up back there!

I don't know how it is, but I am quite certain that he is alive.

H-He can't be. 
Then what I just did was for nothing?

That is correct.

You appear to be surprised.

Very well. I'll explain it to you.

This turned out to be a happy mistake for me, too.

There is a small lump inside my head.

It is what forms my nucleus.

As long as it is not destroyed, I am able to go on regenerating my body.

When I blew myself up, my nucleus was lucky enough to have survived unharmed.

To be honest, I never counted on being able to regenerate myself.

I was just lucky.

What was even more fortunate for me was the fact that even without No.18, my body regenerated in its perfect form.

And not just my normal perfect form, either.

It had become greatly powered up, just like Son Gohan had.

This is probably due to my Saiyan cells granting me a huge increase in power after I was saved from near-death.

What's more, I was able to study Son Goku's Instantaneous Movement.

In other words, I was able to return here, even more perfect than I was before.

Far from defeating me, Son Goku appears to have wound up giving me several presents.

What's so funny?

I'm happy.

Happy?

Yeah. I'm happy that after getting my father killed because of my arrogance, I can now avenge him.

I wanted to be the one to kill you.
That's what I was thinking.

Hmph, we'll see about that.

I don't think you'll be so lucky this time around.

Trunks!

He's dead!

T-Trunks...

N-No...

Kakarrot's son will not be the one taking vengeance!

It will be Trunks' father-- me!

Damn it!

V-Vegeta!

Away with you, Vegeta!

Well, well, this is an unexpected bonus.

G-Gohan!

Vegeta, you dumb-ass!

We can always bring Trunks back to life with the Dragon Balls!

Ho, it looks like your spunk hasn't diminished, at least.

But I'm not playing around anymore.

I'm bringing this to an end, right now.

Cell's power has risen more than I thought.

A-A senzu bean! Are there any more senzu beans?!

We've used them all up.

I-It's all over this time for sure!

Now that our last hope, Gohan, has ended up like that.

I...will suffer you no more.

You and the whole Earth will be gone!


Combine Our Power! The Mightiest Final Kamehameha"   




I'll blow the Earth away, too.
There won't be any trace left--just the blackness of space.

It's no use. I can't win.

Cell has returned with an unbelievable amount of power.

Father, I'm sorry. I wasn't able to protect the Earth from Cell.

I could have protected the Earth if I'd left well enough alone, too.

D-Damn, how can this be? To think that I would become excess baggage...

Me, the Saiyan prince...

I-I'm sorry, Gohan.

Vegeta-san is apologizing?

He has realized that there is absolutely nothing we can do.

Gohan...

Damn it!

Curse our lack of power!

I am perfect. It's beyond my imagination.

Is this the ultimate, perfect form that Doctor Gero sought after?

Everything is just as Doctor Gero calculated.

The only thing he didn't plan on was that the Earth would be lost, but the Earth was bound to perish someday anyhow.

I can move to another planet using Instantaneous Movement.

Perfect strength. Far beyond my imagination.

Damn it! Is there really nothing we can do?!

Is the Earth on its way to its end?

I've already built up enough power to blow away not just the Earth, but the entire solar system.

What's the matter, Gohan?
Go on, show me your final resistance!

Do it. I know that there's no point in resisting.

I won't let just my father die.
We're all in it together.

Hmph, what rubbish.

This is such an anticlimactic ending.

Well then, I will not hesitate to bring everything to darkness.

It's all over. The Earth will be wiped out.

Hey! Can you hear me?!

Don't give up. That ain't like you, Gohan!

F-Father?! Where are you?!

The Next World. I'm speaking to you with Kaio-sama's help.

You've got all that power that you and I built up together, ain't you?

Blast him with a Kamehame-Ha as hard as you can.

Do that, and you're sure to beat him. I mean it.

But I can only use one of my arms now, and I've got less than half of my Ki left.

Who is he talking to?

The terror has him talking to himself.

It's okay. You can beat him.

Believe in your own strength, Gohan.

Right now...you're the strongest person in the universe.

A-All right, Father.

I'll do as much as I'm able to.

I'm enjoying myself well enough in the Next World with Kaio-sama, so you enjoy yourself on Earth.

Though he has put me out here.

I'm sorry, Father. 
It's because I got carried away with myself...that I got you killed.

Ha! Gohan, there's no need to grieve.

Your father may be dead, but whenever you think of me, I'll always be with you.

But...

If that's how you feel, then avenge my death.

Go on, let Cell have it!

Right!

--Gohan...
--H-He's back in the fight.

Ka...me...ha...me...

You've finally come around, have you?

I-It's no use. He just can't beat him.

Gohan's Ki is weaker than his.

See you in hell!

This is bad! Get out of here!

Gohan...

Cell is... Cell is pushing him back outright.

To think that not even Gohan-san is a match for Cell's power...

The Earth really is going to be blown away!

Gohan! Bear up!

Oh, I'm surprised you can hold out this well in the shape you're in.

It's no use, all right. He's being completely forced back.

It's over now. I'm putting an end to this!

What's wrong? You should be able to bring out more power than this!

I can't. This is all there is.

I really am just the weak, spoiled crybaby Son Gohan.

Nothing has changed in all this time.

You're wrong, Gohan! 
You may not know this, but you've helped me out time and again before.

If you get serious, like you did those times, and release all your power, you're sure to beat Cell!

What are you babbling about?!
Have you started saying your prayers?!

Hang in there, Gohan!

Fool! I have obtained the ultimate perfect form!

You think I will be beaten by that kind of power?!

It can't be!

I know!

Gohan! Somewhere in the back of your mind, you're worrying about the damage to the Earth!

Don't worry about that!

We can repair any damage with the Dragon Balls!

Give it all you've got!

B-But...

Down you go, down you go!
Down to hell you go!

Gohan...

Sit tight, Gohan!

Piccolo!

Piccolo!!

Cell! Take this!

Out of my way, you scum!

Piccolo!

Piccolo-san!

D-Damn it...

G-Gohan...!

Piccolo...

I don't care what you say, that's crazy!
There's nothing we can do!

Piccolo has to be well aware of that.

T-Tenshinhan...

H-Hold on, Tenshinhan, don't tell me you're thinking of going, too!

It goes against my nature to stand around here, not doing anything, just waiting for death.

You're saying you've got your warrior's pride, right?

That's right. We've got nothing to lose now.

And I want to stay positive.

Kuririn, look after Trunks.

You, too, Yamucha-san?!

Let's go!

Yeah!

Geez, those guys are such daredevils!

No. ...

I'm glad I got to see you again, one last time. Bye, now.

Those guys, too? That riff-raff is sure getting carried away.

Raise your Ki even higher, Gohan!

Your struggling is in vain!
I'm going to settle this, right now!

Take this!

Kiko-ho!!

Yamucha-san! Tenshinhan-san! Kuririn-san!

Gohan! Raise your Ki even higher!
You can beat him!

Father!

You pesky flies!

You want to rush your deaths that badly?!

In that case, I will grant your wish!

Piccolo-san!

Gohan! I'm not about to let you die alone!

You were the first one to ever speak to me like a real person.

Why am I even trying to get up again?

It would be so much easier to just stay down.

In the past, I would have long since given up.

It's because of Goku and Gohan that I've gotten like this.

I'm holding this against the two of you.

I've walked the way of the warrior, aspiring to be like Goku.

It's because of Goku that I'm even here at all now.

And now that I've let Goku die, I cannot allow his son Gohan to die right in front of me, as well!

Goku, Gohan is incredible.
He is every bit your child.

I sure adore you guys.

Stay out of my way, you small fry!

You presume too much, each and every one of you!

No matter how much trash like you gets together, it's no use!

Away with you!

Gohan-san...!

Fight back! Fight back, Gohan!

Father...!

You're still not releasing all of your power!

Let your power explode!

Farewell!

--Vegeta!
--Now!

W-What?!

I-It can't be...!

I-It's gone... Cell's Ki has completely vanished.

H-He's finally been defeated, right?

It would appear so.

He did it. Gohan has finally beaten that bastard Cell!

--He did it! Gohan-chan did it!
--He did it! He did it! Gohan did it!

He finally brought it to a close.

Yeah.

Well done, Gohan.

At last... At last, Cell is defeated.

The battle is over, and the Earth has been saved by a slim margin.

Thank you, Son Goku.

And... farewell.


Farewell with a Smile! Heading for New Days..."   


Y-You did it. You really did defeat Cell.

That was awesome!

Hey, Gohan, that was really amazing! You did it!

I still can't believe it. We've all been spared!

--Yeah.
--We'll take you up to Dende, in the Heavenly Realm, right away.

We may not have any senzu beans, but once we have him touch you, you'll be good as new!

All right, let's go.

Th-Thank you.

G-Gohan!

He's fine. He just passed out, that's all.

Never mind him, are you all right, Yamucha?

Are you sure you can fly to the Heavenly Realm in your condition?

Hey, compared to Gohan here, no sweat.

Okay. Well then, I guess I'll take Trunks with me.

Oh, then... I-I'll take No. with me.

W-Well, I mean, she's one of Cell's victims, too...

Piccolo, we're going.

Yeah, you go on ahead.

Okay.

Let me give you a hand, Vegeta.

M-Mind your own business.

Go on, get out of here. I don't need your help.

Okay.

I-I've been completely shown up, by both father and son.

D-Damn you, Kakarrot...

Dying the way you did...

I'll never fight again.



Who were those people?!

I-It's gotten quiet.

Ah! Mister Satan!
W-What exactly happened here?!

Huh? W-Well...

I saw that boy bento vendor and Cell hit each other with that unusual light, but after that tremendous explosion, I couldn't see anything.

Oh... no, you didn't, you didn't...

Where is Cell? What happened to Cell?

Well, uh, Cell was, you see...

I-I suppose he was defeated by me, if you can believe that.

B-But how, exactly?

O-Oh, those two were messing around with their ridiculous ball of light tricks, so I got fed up, decided enough was enough, and then, ker-splat! I kicked Cell's keister!

Ker-splat!

S-So then, the boy bento vendor and those others...

Ker-splat! Hmm?

O-Oh, they thanked me, and left.

Hey! The equipment in the relay truck is still working!

People of the world, thank you for waiting!

We now resume our broadcast!

I have joyous news!
People of the world, the Earth...

The Earth has been saved!

Thanks to Mister Satan!

A-Are you Dende?

Yes. Here, let me see Gohan-san, quickly.

S-Sure.

Gohan-san!

--Dende!
--Thank goodness!

I-I'm so sorry about Goku-san.

There's no reason to be.

I heard Father speaking to me.

I also distinctly felt Father's Ki, and could even smell him.

I was together with Father the whole time I was fighting Cell.

It was because Father was with me that I was able to beat Cell.

Hmm, well...

Whatever the case, you did well, Gohan.

Piccolo-san...

You really have gotten strong, Gohan.

You're awake?

Dende! Hurry and get away from her! 
You'll be killed!

That's not true at all!

Th-This is Kami-sama's palace.
It's all right. Gohan defeated Cell.

Gohan did?

That's right!

He's gotten unbelievably strong!

It won't do you any good to go on a tear now!

Hey, get back over here.

You can thank Kuririn.

After Cell spit you back out, he protected you for all he was worth.

Oh, er, you know, I just couldn't leave you there, and all...

I get it!

Kuririn-san is sweet on No.18-san!

Don't go blurting it out!

Huh?! Seriously?!

You're kidding, right?!

I mean, she's an Artificial Human.

Hmph!

You expect me to be grateful?

Did you think I was going to clasp your hands and say thank you, little buddy?

Don't be ridiculous.

Why, that jerk!

What kind of attitude is that?!
I ought to knock her on her butt!

You wouldn't have a chance in hell.

Forget about her--using the Dragon Balls to bring Trunks and everyone else who was killed back to life is our next order of business, isn't it?

Yes, yes.

I-It's all right, Kuririn-san.

As far as friends go, you've got us, don't you?

Sh-Shut up.

Come forth, Dragon, and grant us our wish!

W-What... is that?!

Now, speak thy wishes.
I shall grant thee any two wishes.

Shen Long!

Please bring back to life all the people who were killed by Cell!

That is a simple request.

Nope, it didn't work.

With the new Dragon Balls and Shen Long that Dende made--

I thought there might be a chance, so I searched him out, but sure enough, I can't sense Goku's Ki.

He has not come back to life.

--Oh...
--I can grant thee one other wish.

Speak thy second wish.

Is there no way for you to bring Son Goku back to life?

We want him brought back, whatever it takes.

Son Goku has already been returned to life once. 
It is impossible.

Speak some other wish.

He says it's impossible.

No, there has to be some way to do it. Think!

How about this?

We have time turned back to before Goku dies, or something?

Oh, yeah, let's do that!

If we do that, Cell will also be restored to before he blows himself up.
We'll be right back where we started.

Oh, yeah.

I know!

We can just make our wish to Polunga on Namek!

Of course. 
The original Shen Long, Polunga, can bring dead people back to life over and over again.

Then, if one of us were to go to Planet Namek...

Okay, let's make that our second wish.

Guys! Hold on a minute!

It's me! Goku!

--Goku?!
--F-Father...

I'm speaking to you from the Next World. 
Listen to me.

A long time ago, Bulma said something to me.

She said that I seemed to attract bad guys.

When you think about it, that's the truth, ain't it?

So I get the feeling that if I ain't around, the Earth will stay peaceful. 
Kaio-sama acknowledges it, too.

I ain't saying that I want to be a martyr or anything.

I've saved the Earth and whatnot, so Kaio-sama says they'll give me special treatment.

Ordinary folks, and bad guys like Cell, turn into just spirits, but they're going to let me keep my body.

What's more, I won't ever get any older.

There are also old masters from the past here in the Next World, so it sounds like I'll really enjoy it.

Kaio-sama also just came back to life by the power of Shen Long, but he says he's stepping down, and will stick with me.

So, while it ain't fair to Chichi and Gohan, you don't have to bring me back to life.

Gohan is already more mature than I am, and all.

Th-That's not true, Father!

So that's that. Bye, all!
I'll see you guys again once you die!

Bye-bye!

Goku...

H-He seems kind of cheerful for someone who's dead, so I guess he doesn't lament anything.

Yeah. Same as he's always been, ever since he was a kid.

Ah! It ain't there! My tail ain't there!

Eh, oh well.

"Eh, oh well," huh?

--Absolutely.
- Where's my Nyoi Bo?

Okay, I'm off!

Yahoo!

We've always been the ones eating his dust.

Eat this. You'll feel better.

Hmph, that's the kind of man he was.

Even when I tried to kill him, he fed me a senzu bean, and on top of that, he turned down becoming Kami.

Father was always kind...

...and he always gave me courage.

Father, thank you.

Um...

I've been waiting for your second wish...

...this whole time...

Well, how about it? Speak thy second wish.

I shall grant thee any wish.

W-What do we do? Anyone have anything?

If we don't decide soon, Shen Long is going to disappear on us.

Have ye no wish?

Th-The girlfriend I'm with now wants kind of an expensive necklace.

Would that be okay?

I'm just saying...

Well, what will it be?

Art thou finished?

Sh-Shen Long...

...can you turn the Artificial Humans No.17 and No.18 back into the people they used to be?

That idiot!

I cannot do that.

The two Artificial Humans are beings that far exceed my own power.

I cannot return them to the people they once were.

S-Sure enough, no such luck.

Why No.17 , too? In any case, he's dead now, isn't he?

No, the first wish was to bring back to life all of the people who were killed by Cell, so it wouldn't be surprising if No.17 came back to life, too.

So that's it. Still...

Then, can you at least remove the explosive devices that have been placed inside of their bodies?

That would be possible.

All right!

Kuririn-san...

I have removed the explosive devices.

Well then, farewell!

Kuririn-san, why would you make a wish like that?

W-Well, I mean, you've gotta feel bad for them, you know?

Imagine, having a bomb inside your body.

You're awfully nice, huh, Kuririn-san?

Yamucha-san, I'm sorry.

I jumped in and made my own wish, so now you can't give that necklace to your girlfriend.

Huh? D-Don't be silly! That was obviously a joke, don't you know?

There's no way I would use Shen Long for something as petty as that!

Th-That little...

I have to ask, though, Kuririn,

why did you have No.18s's bomb removed, too?

Oh, sure, I did have a thing for No.18,
but No.17 has No.18.
They go well together, right?

And so...

You're hopeless.

Th-This appears to be about love. I don't get it.

N-No. !

You idiot! No.17 is my twin brother!

Your twin brother?!

But don't go getting any ideas!

It's not like I'm grateful for what you did with the bombs!

You cue ball!

See you later.

Huh?

Hey, Kuririn! If she said she'll see you later, it means there's still a little hope, right?

R-Really?!

T-Take it easy, Kuririn!

Well, in matters of love, I am the one with the most experience here.

There's still a little hope...

Then again, Kuririn, I wouldn't get my hopes up.

She may be a monster, but she's still very pretty.

The competition is going to be fierce.

I don't get it at all.

Piccolo, matters of love may be a bit too much for you.

I guess I'm only halfway happy.

I sure am going to miss having Goku here.

Y-Yeah...

I'm heading home. 
Chaozu must be worried about me.

I doubt I'll ever see any of you again.

Take care, everyone.

You, too.

Goodbye. Give Chaozu-san my regards.

Yeah. Gohan, I will never forget Son Goku.

You take good care of your mother.

Right!

Trunks...

With the power you've got now, you can easily defeat the Artificial Humans in the future, but hang in there.

Right. Thank you for all that you've done.

Bye, now.

--Goodbye!
--See you!

Well, we should be going, too.

Trunks-san, when are you leaving for the future?

I think I'll stay and get plenty of sleep tonight, then leave tomorrow.

All right, we'll come see you off tomorrow.

Right.

Piccolo-san, are you going to live here?

Yeah, that's what I was planning.

Would it be okay if I dropped in once in a while?

Of course.

Everyone, you've really done outstanding work.

Bye, now. I'll see you later, Dende.

Be sure to drop by, okay?

See you later, Popo-san.

Yeah.

All right, let's take off for a new tomorrow!

Goodbye!

Hey!


Bring Peace to the Future! Goku's Spirit is Eternal"   


You mean here?

Now then, let's get started.

Hold on, what happened to you?

You're a lot taller now, aren't you?

Yes, Mom. At Kami-sama's palace, there's this place called the Room of Spirit and Time, and you can train there for a whole year while only one day passes.

I'm not sure I understand all that, but either way, I'm so glad that you've come home safely.

So, how did it go?
Judging by the look on your face, it looks like it went well.

Yes.

Sounds like it was rough.

I see. So Son-kun died after all.

But Gohan-kun was able to avenge him, right?

Yes.

I also fought alongside Dad.

With Vegeta?

Sure enough, Dad was more than just a cold-hearted man.

When Cell ran me through...

T-Trunks...!

Damn it!

He really got mad, big-time, over me.

R-Right? I told you so, didn't I?

Yes.

Oh, yeah? Vegeta did, huh?
So he did have that side to him...

We have an urgent news bulletin.

It's a report on the Artificial Humans.

No.17 and No.18 have appeared again.

They are currently attacking at Marker , BBN--Parsley City!

Miserable Artificial Humans! Your time is up!

Trunks...

It's all right.

This is the reason why I went into the past to meet Goku-san.

This time, I have to avenge Gohan-san and the others.

We have to bring peace to not just the past, but this age, as well.

Be careful, Trunks. Don't get in over your head.

Right.

--Damn it!
--Hmph, just like a little kid.

Taking it out on them because you lost at a video game.

Butt out! You keep quiet!

They killed my wife and child...

Damn.

You're a pretty good shot with that, geezer.

You want your reward?

That's what you want, right?

Y-You devil...!

Who's there?!

Trunks?

No.17! No.18! This is the end for you! I'm putting you away!

Oh, you're still alive? You know, I have to say, there's no other fool who can pull off vain effort quite like you.

No.17, I am in a foul mood!

You don't mind if I make short work of him, right?

Because he's really annoying me!

It will leave us one less thing to play with, but all right.

Suit yourself, No.18.

Hmph, this is more fun than that video game.

Watch out, No.18 !

Damn it!

Now you've done it!

Damn it! You'll pay for this!

You've gotten a little better, if you're actually getting No.18 upset at you.

In the past I traveled to in the time machine, you two were not half bad. 
But in this era, you keep destroying cities and tormenting people for nothing.

I cannot allow that.

What are you talking about? Dream on!

Let's let him have it, No.18 !

Y-You couldn't have...

H-How could the likes of you kill No.18?

That was for the friends of mine that you've killed.

And this... is for killing Gohan-san!

Away with you!

It's over.

No, not yet.

There's still one crucial person remaining.

And so, time passes on.

With No.18 and No.17 gone, along with the destruction they caused, peace had returned somewhat, and the work of restoration in the cities had begun.

Also, the energy required for the time machine's round-trip journey into the past had finally been charged.

Mom, I'm off to tell everyone that I've defeated No.16 and No.17.

Trunks, be careful.
Give everyone my regards, okay?

Yes, Mom.

Mom, go back inside the house.

Huh?

You've got a girlfriend, right?
Wow, when did you manage that?

Why, you little loverboy, you...

I know you're there, Cell!

You're planning to kill me, turn into an egg, board the time machine, and go into the past,

so that you can assimilate No. and No. , right?

To achieve your perfect form?

What? H-How do you know all that?

That plan is going to fail.
And then, it will all be over.

My plan will fail, you say?
Hmph, because of you?

Cell, your perfect form was unbelievably strong, to be sure, but as you are now, I'm more than strong enough to defeat you.

I get it. You've gone into the past, huh?

I see. That explains why you're so unusually well-informed.

But I have to say,

I don't see how you could say that you could defeat me as I am now.

Trunks, my spy robots have given me all of your data.

With your power, I doubt you could defeat even No.17 and No.18, let alone me.

Hmph, then why are No. and No. now gone?

So that's it.

You're the one responsible for
their disappearance, are you?

I'm going to have to k*ll you, all right.

I'll k*ll you, then take the
time machine into the past,

where I will assimilate No. and No. .

It won't do for us to fight here in Metro West.

Its reconstruction is fairly well along now.

We're going to relocate.

You little punk. You appear to
have improved your skill somewhat,

but it's still a joke if you
think you can defeat me.

I am the ultimate Artificial Human
created by Doctor Gero-sama.

There is no way that anyone
in the world can defeat me.

We'll see about that.

There is no way I'm letting
you go back into the past!

That's enough!

Th-This shouldn't be...

D-Damn... I am the ultimate Artificial Human.

There's no way I should be losing to that kid!

Cell, you're the last one...

You're the last one I can allow to live,
for the sake of peace on Earth!

If that's how you want it, you can
be taken aback by this move!

Ka... me...

...ha... me...

I'm going to utterly obliterate you, Cell!

D-Damn it!

Now, everything has come to an end.

Thank you, everyone.

Thank you, Goku-san.

--All done!
--Wow! Impressive, Kaio-sama!

Whoopsie! Kaio-sama, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I don't have the heart to build it again.

Kaio-sama, this is perfect, ain't it?

I didn't really want to live
in a place like this anyway.

Let's go somewhere.

I know! Where are these old
masters of the Next World?

The masters of the Next World?

No fair! You promised me you'd take me

to where the old masters of
the Next World are, didn't you?

Unless you don't know where they are.

No, of course I know. It's just that,
Goku, when we get there--

Let's go! I want to hurry and meet
these masters of the Next World.

Goku's adventures continue.

However, we will leave the telling
of those tales for another time.

Until then, this is goodbye for now.

See you later, everyone.
