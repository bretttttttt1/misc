CIVIL WAR: EPISODE III - THE SITH CONFLICT
Near the end of the Clone Wars, Darth Sidious shows up and is ready to fulfill his ultimate goal to rule the galaxy.
Sidious is ready for his new apprentice Darth Vader to get in on the action and kill the other Jedi.
But Vader is struggling to choose the dark side and save his wife or remain faithful to the Jedi Order .

The cover, R2.
Master, General Grievous' ship is forward-
who flies feather droids.
I've seen it. That won’t be hard.
- Oddball, are you a copycat? - Copy, Red President.
The symbol of my position. Form your group behind me.
We are in your heart, General Kenobi.
S-foils set in attack .
This is where the fun begins.
Let them pass through us.
They are all on me. I've got my- .
- I'm going to help them. - No.
No, they do their job so we can do ours.
Missiles wear out slowly. It's a stretch.
- U b'an degun. - U b'u lamini.
A ka ɲi, R4.
Ayi, ayi, ayi, ayi-Ayi, foyi ka ɲi kojugu.
Surges all power units, R2. Stop the rear lifts .
We got 'em, R2.
Run against the droids .
- I'm going to get up. Is it Anakin? - I've seen them. Buzz the droids.
R4, be very careful. You have a-
We’ve got that
They shut down all the media .
- To the left so I can get rid of them. - The missionary work.
To the commando ship. Thank you Chancellor. I'm running out oftricks here.
The name of the co-
- Catch your fire! You are not helping here. - I agree with you. A bad idea.
I couldn't see anything. My cockpit is smoky.
They are all on me. It's Anakin!
- Go to the right. - Hold on, Anakin. You will kill them both.
Get out of here. There is nothing more.
I will not leave you, Professor.
Get it, R2.
Get to know each other.
R2, hit the middle eye of the buzz droid.
- Yes, you got it! - Great, R2
The general's command ship was dead ahead.
So do you think grades are overrated?
Sorry, Professor.
I have a bad feeling about it.
It’s where they are. Please accept them.
R2, to the chancellor.
Chancelier ka signal nana right-
the viewing platform on the roof.
I understand Count Dooku.
I see a trap. The next change?
Kaban uka sipita.
R2 , second . I need you to stay on board.
Here. Download this and wait for orders .
What's going on, Captain?
Two Jedi dive into the hangar's bay. We're tracking them down.
As Count Dooku said.
T'unjers.
Drop your weapons. I'm not going to drop 'em.
Roger was like that. Roger, Roger, .
Roger, roger, .
Those are Jedi warriors all good.
Did you hit the stop button? No. Do you do that?
- No. - Well, there's more than one way to get out of here.
We don't want to go outside.
We want to go somewhere else. R2, activate elevator 31174 .
Come on, what is the R2 Value ?
R2, are you a copycat?
R2, ka alifanta baara.
31174 of the Act.
Get back to work. There's nothing wrong with that.
Elevator 31174 ye .
R2, an ye- .
Always traveling.
R2 , the comlink .
R2, can you hear me?
R2 ye?
¡Waw!
R2 ye! R2 ye!
Stop. Stop. R2, we have to grow.
Hands down, Jedi.
R2, are you a copycat?
R2, can you hear me? R2, we go up, not down.
Hey, Friday!
Now, that’s even better.
You stupid little astro droid.
That’s what you are.
Nayranakaja! Nayranakaja!
What was that about? Well, R2 is- .
No loose wire jokes. What is a Sista?
He's trying to. I didn't say anything.
The Chancellor. Are you okay with that?
Number Dooku.
This time we will do it together. I would have mentioned that.
You need to get help. You don't have to compare yourself to him. He is a Sith lord.
Chancellor Palpatine, the Sith lords are our specialty.
Your swords, please.
We don't want to mess things up in front of the chancellor.
Don't run this time, Dooku.
I am still waiting for this.
Our strength has doubled since we last met, Count.
Ok. Twice the pride, twice the fall.
Have-
I find you awful, Skywalker.
You have hatred. You're in pain.
But you don't use it.
Good, Anakin. Ok.
Aw k'a faga.
Kill him now.
I don't have to do that.
Do the same thing.
Well done, Anakin.
It was too bad to live.
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
I didn't have to do that. Not the Jedi way.
It’s just natural. He cut your hand off, and you want revenge.
Not for the first time, Anakin.
Do you remember what you told me about your mother and Beautiful People?
Now we have to go before more security droids arrive.
Anakin, there is no time.
We need to get off this ship before it’s too late.
- He seems to be doing well. "Let go, or we'll never get there."
His future will be the same as ours.
Get ready to attack!
Taqi pilanaka, nina! Nina ye!
The elevator does not work.
R2, alifanta 3224 baara.
- Reverse Stabilizers. - Segment stabilizers.
luran magnetism! luran magnetism!
Emergency fire reinforcement engines.
We've leveled, sir.
Easy. We are in some kind of crisis.
What was wrong with me? Wait.
- What is the answer? - Than.
R2 R2, he fell in love.
It’s going to pass. Fly!
Check out the hangar bay where things are still running.
R2, taa yan.
R2, are you a copycat?
General, we have a Jedi.
They are corridor 328. Activate lightning protection.
Ray shields (shoulder).
Please wait a little longer. How did this happen?
We are smarter than this. It doesn’t seem to be the case.
I said patiently. Patience?
Than. R2 will be part of it in a few hours,
and then... he'll deploy ray shields.
Consider? Okay.
I don't know where it is.
Do you have a plan "B"?
Than. The conversation partner.
General Kenobi . We are waiting for you.
P'ampacht'ita is the one.
It wasn’t a great rescue. You are welcome.
Years-
Anakin Skywalker ye .
I was hoping that the person you were with would be a little more mature….
General Grievous . You are younger than I thought.
The Jedi are a mess .
We have work to do, Anakin. Try not to upset him.
Lightsabers would make a nice addition to my collection.
Not this time. And this time you won’t survive.
R2.
You lead!
Torture them!
It's you. Sisan!
Stay with the times! Wow!
Thank you for the answer! Thank you for the answer!
The ball!
Don’t worry about them. The ship is around. Yes, sir.
You're a loser, General Kenobi.
Get out of here! Ride!
Time to abandon ship.
All exhaust pods can be launched.
That’s a sad thing. Would you drive a cruiser like that?
You mean do you know how to get off how much is left of this thing? Ok?
Well, anyway, I mean you don't need to be able to pilot this.
You are tying yourself up.
Open the door . Increase all flaps and fin drag.
We lost something.
Don’t worry about it. We still run half the boat.
We're taking it really fast now.
8 is 60.
We have the air. You have to hold on to it. Let's level up.
Ka Jayapachataki sigi sen kan.
Ngågya, R2
5000. Fire ships left and right.
- An b'i ta - Kopi.
- Downward slope, facing forward. - We're coming in too hot.
Another exciting descent.
"Are you coming, Lord?" - No, I'm not in politics.
I have to tell the council.
Plus, someone has to be the poster boy.
Wait. This whole operation was your idea.
Let's not forget, Anakin, you saved us from the buzz droids.
And you killed Count Dooku, and saved the chancellor,
carrying me on my back without him knowing.
It's all because of your education.
Anakin, let’s be honest. If you are a business today, .
and you deserve your big day with politicians.
Okay dear. But you owe me one thing, and you don't save your body 10 times more.
About 8 times. The business of Cato Neimoidia is ignored.
I'll see you at the briefing.
Chancellor Palpatine, are you alright?
Than. Thank you for your two Jedi warriors.
Count Dooku is killed, but General Grievous escapes once again.
General Grievous will run and hide, as he does. He’s a terrible guy.
But after Count Dooku dies, he becomes the leader of the droids.
And I'm telling you, the senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.
The Jedi Council will then make finding Grievous our top priority.
Look at the men. Excuse me.
Come on, the R2 Republic cannot respect you enough.
Thank you, Senator Organa.
So it can't be the worst of it all.
I definitely agree with you there.
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.
But the war will go on until General Grievous gets his spare parts.
Well, I will do everything in the senate.
Excuse me. Sure.
Anakin was the name.
N b’i kanu, Padmé.
There were questions that you were murdered.
I want to get better.
It feels like they have a lifetime together.
And it might have been, had the chancellor not been arrested.
I don’t think they’ll ever bring us back out around the boards.
Wait. It’s not here. Yes, here it is.
II am tired of all this deceit. I don't care if they know we're married.
Anakin, don't say that.
Are you okay with that? You're shaking yourself.
What is going on?
Something strange happened.
And I am pregnant.
O don- .
So, it's won-It's awesome.
What are we going to do?
Now we have nothing to worry about. Okay dear?
This is an interesting time.
The happiest time of my life.

Yes, Lord Sidious?
General Grievous, .
I advise separatist leaders to send Mustafar .
It will be done, sir.
The end of the war is near, General.
But Account Dooku-
His death was a great loss.
Soon, the new student-
the other smaller and stronger.
And, I want to get my son home from Naboo.
We can go to sea, where no one will know,
where we can live comfortably.
I can go early in the morning and get her baby’s room ready.
I know that unerring truth. It is near the gardens.
You are so beautiful.
This is because I am so loved.
Yes.
No, I love you so much.
So love blinds you?
So I'm not really saying that.
But maybe that was true.
Anakin, help us!
What is it that bothers you?
Yes.
I remember when I gave this to you.
How long does it take to be honest with each other?
It was a dream come true.
South?
As I used to say about my mother, .
just before he died.
Years?
And it was about you.
Sita is the one.
It was just a dream come true.
You die in childbirth.
And the baby too?
No t'a dɔn.
It was just a dream come true.
I won't let this one go wrong.
This baby will change our lives.
I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate.
And if the council finds out you're the father, you'll be expelled-
I- I know it. I know.
Do you think Obi-Wan can help us?
We don’t need his help.
Our child is a blessing.
Thoughts ahead of time? Preconceptions .
The visions are you- .
They have pain and suffering.
In.
Are you talking about yourself, or someone you know?
That's it.
Is it close to you?
In.
I janto siniko la, Anakin.
Fear of extinction is a path to madness.
I will not let these visions come true, Lord Yoda.
Death is a natural part of life.
Rejoice in those around you who become the Strength.
Worry about them, don't worry. Miss them, don't do that.
Attachment leads to jealousy.
It’s a shadow of love.
What am I supposed to do, Lord Yoda?
Educate yourself and let go…
losing everything you were afraid of.
You got the news about the outside tires being scuffed.
I'm sorry. They treated me very well.
I don't have any discussion. In short, they are fine.
Saleucami flees, Professor Vos sends his troops to Boz Pity.
So what is the problem?
The Senate is waiting…
many of today’s powerful forces get voted into chancellorship.
So that’s just stupid and over the top. Is that a bad thing?
It will be easier for us to end this war.
Watch out for your friend Palpatine.
Why should you be so careful?
He sought your presence. For what reason?
He didn't say anything. He didn't tell the council?
That’s amazing, isn’t it? All of these are unknown.
And it broke my heart.
Trust me, Anakin.
Kɔsɛbɛ.
I need your help, baby.
What do you mean?
I'm going to put it on you. For what reason? I don't understand.
To be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic.
Anakin , san 1999 .
I appoint you as the personal representative of the Jedi Order .
I? A veterinarian?
I'm still struggling, sir.
But the council makes their own choices. They will never get it.
I think they will. They need you.
It's more than you.
In the silence of this position, the conference ended.
Unfortunately this decision was made by Chancellor Palpatine.
I understand.
You have this brain, but we don’t give you a master’s degree.
Is there such a thing as that?
How do you do that? That is very sad.
That is not true.
How can you be in the council and not know it very well?
Take your seat, young Skywalker.
Forgive me, Professor.
We studied every community in the Republic,
but they have no sign of General Grievous.
Hiding on the outside rim for Grievous.
Clean outdoor environments .
We don’t have many boats.
What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
It is important to send an attack team quickly .
He was right about that. It’s a system that shouldn’t be lost.
Go ahead, I tell you.
I have a good relationship with Wookiees.
This is then fixed. Yoda's battalion of clones...
Kashyyyk's problem is the Wookiees.
Strength to you all.
What kind of nonsense is this?
Put me on the council and not the boss?
Never in Jedi history. That’s a shame.
Rest in peace, Anakin. You have been given a great honor.
Being on the council at your age wasn't like it used to be.
The truth is you are too close to the chancellor.
The Council doesn't like it when he gets involved in Jedi affairs.
I swear I didn't try to run for council. But, it's what you want.
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to be a good one.
It has nothing to do with that.
One reason council approved the appointment…
it’s that the chancellor believes in you.
And? Anakin, I agree with you.
I didn't mean to put you through that. What is the nature of this?
The Council would like to keep you informed of all the actions of the chancellor.
They want to know what he's doing.
Do they want to target the chancellor?
But it is a betrayal. We are at war, Anakin.
Why didn’t council give us that job when we were in session?
The work does not have to be in writing.
The Chancellor is not a bad person, Obi-Wan.
He became friends with me. He has taken care of me since I got here.
Therefore, you need to provide assistance.
Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate, not the president,
who can stay in the office long after his job is over.
Some members of the Senate asked them to stay longer.
Yes, but control your emotions, Anakin. Something was out of place.
You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code,
Against the Republican, against a mentor and friend.
That’s the uncertainty here. Why are you asking me this?
The councilor asked you.
Anakin isn't going to be too happy with his new job.
It's scary, separating them.
I don't think the guy can handle it.
Ne t day a day.
With all due respect, Sir, isn’t he the chosen one?
Can't he destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
That's what the prophecy says.
This may be a misread prophecy.
It will not disappoint me.
He never did that.
I hope I'm right.
Sometimes I wonder what is going on with the Jedi Order .
I think this war is undermining Republican principles.
Did you ever think we could have a bad conversation?
What do you mean?
What if the democracy we think we work in doesn’t exist,
and the Republic is so corrupt that we fought to destroy it?
Ne dalen to la.
And you sound like a separatist .
That sounds like disobedience.
Now you are closer to the chancellor than anyone.
Please ask him to stop fighting and resume diplomacy.
Don't ask me to do that.
Make a motion in the Senate where such a request is made.
- What is the answer? - No.
You don’t have to do that. Don’t cover it up. I will help you out.
Hold onto me, guys.
Just like we did on the beach at Naboo.
So long ago, when there was nothing but love.
No politics, no conlos, no wars.

"You want to see it, Chancellor." - Yes, Anakin. Get closer and closer.
I have some good news.
Our clone intelligence units locate General Grievous.
Tucked away in the Utapau neighborhood.
In my opinion, yes
We will capture the monster and end this fight.
I was worried about the collective knowledge of the organization…
if you do not select it for this function.
You are the best choice, by far.
Sit back and enjoy.
Leave us alone.

Anakin , san 1999 .
you know, you can't trust the Jedi Council.
If they don’t know you in their target audience, they will soon.
I don't understand.
You must understand what I expected.
The Jedi Council wants to control the Republic.
They decided to betray me.
I don't think so- Anakin.
Find your emotions.
You know, right?
I know they don't believe you. Or members of the senate.
Or Republican, or democratic, for that matter.
I have to admit, my faith in them was shaken.
Sister in law?
They ask you to do something...
it made you feel greedy, didn't it?
They asked you to look at me, didn't they?
I don't -
I don't know what to say.
Remember your previous lessons.
Anyone who has gained power is afraid of losing it.
Even the Jedi themselves. The Jedi use their powers for good .
Well that's a point of view, Anakin.
Sith and Jedi are similar in every way,
as well as their overwhelming demand for power.
The Sith rely on willpower for power.
They think to themselves.
And not the Jedi?
The Jedi are selfless. They care about others.
Have you ever heard of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
No, I thought not.
That’s not a story a Jedi would tell you.
It’s a Sith myth.
Darth Plagueis sits down to.
powerful and intelligent as the dark lord Sith, .
he can use the Force to disturb midi-chlorians...
to be... to live.
He had such knowledge of the dark side, .
and those he cared about would keep him…
rather than death.
Can he really... save people from death?
The dark side of the Force is a path to a lot of good things…
others find it abnormal.
What happened to him?
He was very strong,
it was what he feared.
losing its power.
That eventually happened, of course.
Unfortunately, everything he knew, he taught his pupil.
Then his disciple killed him in his sleep.
It’s a tricky thing.
He could have saved others from death,
but not himself.
Can we learn from this power?
Not in a Jedi.
All the Red Units, right here!
Does Palpatine think General Grievous is in Utapau?
Part of the message was captured in a diplomatic package…
From the head of Utapau.
We have to act accordingly.
Capturing General Grievous will end this battle.
We must move quickly and decisively.
The Chancellor asked... that I run the campaign.
The council will decide for itself who should go,
there is no cancer.
A teacher with more experience is needed.
I'm inclined to agree. Master Kenobi must go.
- I agree with you. - Ayxa.
Eh.
They were very nice. Council is deferred .
The droids turn on their giant electric generators .
And now it's time, Commander. Yes, sir.
Jalakilen!
Head for the cover!
You will need me on this, Sir. I agree with you.
But it might just be a wild bantha chase. Teacher.
I have disappointed you. I don't thank you enough to teach me.
I am proud, and I am sorry.
I just felt so bad about that conference.
Anakin, you are strong and smart, and I am so proud of you.
I have taught you since I was a child.
I teach you everything I know.
And you have been a bigger Jedi than I ever imagined.
But be patient, Anakin.
It won’t be long before the council makes him a Jedi master.
Obi-Wan and more . May the power be with you.
Good morning, old friend. May the power be with you.
Fortunately, most of this continent is here.
In the distance. I'll distract them until I get there.
But don't wait too long. Date. When did I disappoint you?
They were very nice.
The onus is on me not to destroy every droid until I can.
Conserve your energy.
I can't.
Or across the bay, Padmé.
Obi-Wan is here, right?
He left this morning.
What did he want to do?
A b hami on your day.
He said he was devastated.
I feel like I'm lost.
Lost? What do you mean?
Obi-Wan is my advisor.
They trust you with their lives.
What's going on.
I'm not a Jedi, I'm supposed to be.
I'd like to add more.
And I know I shouldn't.
You expect too much of yourself.
I have found a way to save you. Will you save me?
From my nightmares.
Does that bother you?
I won't lose you, Padmé.
I'm not dying in childbirth, Ani.
I made a promise to you. No, I promise you.
Greetings, young Jedi.
What brought you to our distant sanctuary?
Unfortunately, the war.
there's just no here-and-no argument with it.
With your kind permission, I need some fuel...
and use your city as a base when hunting systems near General Grievous .
It’s already here. We are being held hostage.
They're looking at us. I understand.
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.
Tell your men to hide.
If you have knights, now is the time.
Send the fighter back to the ship. Tell Cody I made contact.
Can he bring in more fighters? He didn't say anything.
It won’t be long before the armies of the Republic will be after us here.
I am sending you the Mustafar system on the outside board.
It’s a fireplace.
You will be safe there. Left?
Hmph! Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape you, General.
Without Count Dooku, I doubt you'd be safe.
Thank you, Viceroy, .
you are not in my hands.
Your boat is waiting.
Good morning, guys.
General Kenobi .
You are a brave man.
Aw k'a faga.
After installation.
I personally have to deal with this Jedi slime.
You're going to go.
You are a genius.
I was trained in the Jedi arts by Count Dooku.
Attack , Kenobi .
Go, go, go, go! You have to change it! You have to change it!
Everyone is coming out. Let's go, let's go, let's go.
You have to bury yourself. Date.
You have to change it! You have to change it!
Come on, go ahead! Come on, everyone!
Not an army or a military, .
you must know that you are doomed.
I don't think so.
Oh yes!
Secure the corners.
Master Windu, can I stop you?
General Kenobi's interview with General Grievous,
we started attacking.
Thank you, Commander.
Anakin, please deliver this news to the chancellor.
In his case, a representation of their intentions would help.
Ɔwɔ, Karamɔgɔ.
I understand that there is a plan to destroy the Jedi .
The dark side of the Force surrounded the chancel .
If he doesn't give up his powers and weaken Grievous after he's destroyed,
and from power.
The Jedi Council must take control of the senate…
so that a peaceful transition can take place.
It's a dark place this idea will take us.
We have to take care of ourselves.
Chancelier (Chancelier) ye.
We now have a message from Master Kenobi.
He hires General Grievous.
We'll just have to wait until Professor Kenobi gets to the point.
I have to be there with him.
I find it disappointing what the council has done.
can't fully appreciate your abilities.
Don't you ever wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?
I know.
More and more I feel like this…
I was kicked out of the conference.
I knew there were things in the Force that I wasn't told.
They don't believe you, Anakin.
They see your future.
They know your power is too strong to control.
Break through the smoke of the lies the Jedi are spreading around you.
let me help you understand the subtleties of the Force .
How do you know the ways of the Force?
My mentor taught me all about strength.
Also the dark side of the situation .
Do you know the dark side?
Anakin , san 1999 .
if anyone wants to understand the great mystery.
one must be knowledgeable in all aspects , .
not just a dogmatic little Jedi view .
If you want to be a perfect scientific leader,
you will get more glimpses of this energy.
The Jedi, Anakin.
Only through me.
you can be more powerful than anyJdi.
Learn to recognize the dark side of the Force, .
and you saved your wife…
some died.
What do you think of the snow?
Use my knowledge. Please, please.
You are the father of the Sith.
I know what is troubling you. Hear me out, please.
You cannot continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council.
You've been searching for life since I met you...
greater than an ordinary Jedi.
The usefulness of life, .
thinking in the mind.
- You want to kill him? - I'm really interested.
I know you can do it.
I can understand your pain.
It gives you focus, .
it is more encouraging.
I'd give it to the Jedi Council. Very. You have to do that.
But you don't really know their intentions, do you?
I will soon know the truth about all this.
You are a genius, Anakin.
Know the power of the dark side.
Chance ka Padme kisi .
Aaaah yeah!
It’s not so civilized.
Master Windu, I need to talk to you.
Skywalker, we just got word that Obi-Wan destroyed General Grievous.
We are on track for the chancellor to return emergency powers to the senate.
He will not give up his power. I just learned a scary truth.
I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord.
A Sith father?
Than. What you are looking for.
How do you know that? He knows the ways of the Force.
Learn to use the dark side.
Are you sure you're right? Sure.
Then our worst fear happens.
We must move quickly to keep the Jedi system alive.
Sir, the chancellor is very strong.
If you want to catch him, you'll need my help.
Stay away from this for your own good.
I have a big problem with you, young Skywalker.
There is a lot of fear in your judgment.
I must go, Professor. No.
If what you say is true,
you will have my confidence.
Nka i ka to yan sisan.
Please wait in the council chamber until we return.

any chance of saving it will be lost.

I have to say you got here sooner than you expected.
On behalf of the Galactic Senate,
you are under arrest, Chancellor.
Are you threatening me, MasterJedi?
The Senate must decide his fate.
- I'm going to have a leg. - Not yet.
It is a betrayal then.
You're caught, sir.

I believe it's true.
The Jedi take over.
The pressure of sites will never return.
You are lost.

No, No, you will die!

Are you okay with that? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple.
You could see the smoke from here. I'm fine. I'm fine.

The Jedi are trying to destroy the Republic.

It's so good.
The Chancellor gave me a very important mission.
Separatists gather in Mustafar’s system.
I'll go there and finish this fight.
Wait until he returns.
Things will be different. I made a promise to you.
Please wait for me.
Well, it’s a lot of pressure, R2.
You look good, little friend.
Madam, what is there to do?
No, thank you, 3 PO.
Me- I feel very helpless.
How many other Jedi managed to escape?
For a long time we have no one.
I see thousands of soldiers attacking the Jedi Temple.
So I went looking for Yoda.
Do we meet from the temple?
We received an encoded message from the withdrawal.
He asks all the Jedi to return to the temple.
He said the war was over. Okay, so let's go back.
All other humans will be captured and killed.
Suggest removing the encoded symbol, right?
Yes, Teacher. There are many things.
I agree with you.
And a little more knowledge can light our way.
The arrangement went as you said, sir.
Well done, Viceroy.
When Darth Vader, my new student, arrived,

We have received a message from the Chancellor's Office, sir.
You will send it over. Yes, sir.
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor invites you to.
