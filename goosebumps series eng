Hello, I'm R.L. Stine.
I write the Goosebumps books.

In a few minutes, you're going to see
one of my favorite stories come alive.

The Haunted Mask is a frightening Halloween
story about a girl named Carly Beth.

The horror begins when Carly
Beth puts on the evil haunted mask.

And it ends when she
discovers there is nothing more

powerful than the love
of her family and friends.

What's so scary about that?

You'll see. Viewers, beware.
You're in for a scare.

It's a new store. Where'd that come from?

I don't know, but it's
just in time for Halloween.

Novelty Shop.

Wow.

Pretty scary, huh?

Yeah.

Come on, let's go.

Carly Beth?

Huh? Oh.

Why'd you have to wait until
the last minute to get a pumpkin?

Why does it have to be so creepy out here?

Do you hear breathing?

It's probably you, Carly Beth.

I thought I heard footsteps.

I think someone's
followed us here, Sabrina.

You know, I think you're right.

Somebody's out there.

Somebody. Or something.

That was totally not funny.

I'm sorry.

Why don't you get your
pumpkins and go home?

Okay.

Why are some pumpkins so rotten?

Oh, I found a good one.

No!

Sabrina!

Beth, you should have seen your face.

That was the best one yet, Carly Beth.

Carly Beth, slow down.

Stop.

Why?

So you can laugh at me some more?

I swear I had nothing to do with that.

You know I'd never hurt you.

I know.

Chuck and Steve, they're sickos.
You know that.

I can't believe they followed us all
this way just to scare me like that.

They're creeps. They have no life.

Last weekend at your house,
they pretended they were prowlers.

That wasn't funny.

Sorry.

Last summer, they put
that dead octopus on me.

They're always pulling stuff like that.

I'm sorry they scared you. I really am.

It was a mean and stupid joke.

No, I'm sorry.

It's just...

They don't do this to
anyone else but me, Sabrina.

Why me?

Don't be mad, Carly Beth.

It's just...
you're so scarable, that's all.

I am not. Come on, that's not fair.

Carly Beth, come on.

I may be afraid sometimes, but I mean...
Everyone knows you're afraid of everything.

Okay.

I don't like being scared.
I don't like being afraid, okay?

It's okay.

Maybe someday they'll know how it feels.

You didn't get your pumpkin.

Hey, anybody home? It's me.

Hi.

Hey, are you okay?

Huh?

Did something happen to you?

No, nothing. Why?

I don't know. It's your eyes. You look...

It's nothing.
Don't worry about it, okay, Mom?

Okay, cool, cool. Just asking.

Hey, come here.
I want to show you something.

Check it out.

Mom, it's me. This face is me.

I finished it today in art class.

Oh, it's plaster of Paris, so be careful.
It's hollow.

It's kind of creepy, Mom.

What? Don't you like it?

Oh, I like it. It's really great.

It's just... I mean, why do you
want something that looks like me?

I made something that looks
like you, silly, because I love you.

Why else would I make it?

Carlybeth?

It smiled at me.

What is up with you?

Its mouth opened and it smiled at me.

Carlybeth, you're letting this
Halloween stuff get to you.

I'm sorry. It was the light.
A trick of the light.

Oh, by the way, your duck costume
is all ready. I put it on your bed.

My duck costume?

Remember? You saw a duck at the mall,

and you said you thought it might
be fun to be a duck for Halloween.

I made one for you.

Oh, yeah. Duck costume. Great. Thanks, Mom.

Well, go and take a look at it.
It's very cute.

Cute?

Last thing I want to be
on Halloween is cute.

I want to be scary this time.

Black, black, black, black.

Black, black, black, black.

Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

Take off that duck costume.
It's my costume.

Carlybeth, the scaredy cat.
Carlybeth, the scaredy cat.

So, I'll be at your house about 7.3 7.30.

Go away, child.

Hey, Cozy.

Carlybeth, me and Steve
just want to say we're sorry for

what we did yesterday and
give you a little peace offer.

Ha, ha. Very funny.

It's the whole school knows, huh?

Really, Carlybeth, we're really sorry.
Really.

Fine.
Just leave me alone from now on, okay?

All right. Whatever you want.

Me and Steve, we're just
going to totally leave you alone.

Isn't that right, Steve?

Right, Chuck.

When do you two losers disappear?

What's wrong, Carlybeth?

Oh, it's the water.

Twenty-five, twenty-six,
twenty-seven, twenty-nine, thirty.

Thirty dollars. That should be enough.

It's my turn now.

Oh.

Oh, cool.

It's excellent.

Yeah.

What are you doing here?

Who are you?

I'm... I...

I'd like to buy a mask
for Halloween, please.

We're closed.

Um, only a minute, please.

I really need a mask. It won't be long.

Everything I have is up on the walls.

Five minutes.

Yes?

I told you not to phone
me unless you have news.

How many times do I have to tell you?

Your masks. Have you got them?

Or did you buy a Paraguay?

They are the ones who know.

We don't have time.
We don't have time. You order two.

Well, that's what we need.

Now, what about the two? I...

Please, I'm falling apart.

You need this chemical. I...

I can't go on without it.

I don't care about the customs.

Something...

I don't care about customs.

You are the trouble.

No!

I said no!

Please, mister, I'm really sorry.

You shouldn't be here.

You're not supposed to be here.

I'm sorry, young lady,

but these masks.

are not for sale.

Not for sale?

Why not?

They're too frightening.

That's perfect. I need a really scary mask.

Like that one.

There's a really frightening
gorilla mask out front.

It's made with real gorilla hair.

I will give it to you for nothing.

Uh, I don't think Chuck and Steve

will be scared by a gorilla mask, though.

Who?

Oh, these guys at school.

All they do is torture me.

And?

And... I want to get even.

Ah, revenge.

What is your name?

Carly Beth.

Carly Beth.

You have a nice face, Carly Beth,

but I don't think... These
masks, they're so real-looking.

Take the responsibility.

Chuck and Steve would just die.

I can't. I'm sorry.

Look, here, 30 bucks.

It's everything I have.

No!

Steve, please!

Now!

Here's your money!

What am I doing?

This is going to be great.

I'm going to make Chuck and
Steve wish they never, ever met me.

Bye-bye, Carly Beth. Bye-bye.

Real.

Hey, Noah.

Chuck and Steve!

Stay away!

Who are you?

Why don't you guess?

Mom! Mom!

Help!

He's stupid! Stupid! It's me!

It's Carly Beth.

Carly Beth?

Don't you recognize my clothes?

Your face.

The mask.

Please take off that mask, Carly Beth.
Please.

Okay, okay. Don't have a fit.

Hey, what is this?

My mask. It won't come off.

Stop kidding around, Carly Beth.

I'm not kidding around.

Really, I... I
can't get it off me.

Cool, huh?

Can I try it on?

Actually, no. I'm late.

I'm supposed to meet Sabrina' already.

That was great.

You really freaked out.

How'd you change your voice like that?

That was the scariest part.

I don't know.

But I like it.

Carly Beth, you are scary.

Carly Beth, wait up.

I want to see what your
duck costume looks like.

Mom, I'm kind of in a hurry.

I was supposed to meet Sabrina's by 7.30.

Wait a sec. Sabrina can wait.

That must be your dad.

I hope his trip's going well.

Have fun with Sabrina and be careful, okay?

Okay, thanks, Mom.

Hello?

Oh, hi, honey.

Is Chicago going well?

Yeah.

Should we get Steve?

Okay, Carly Beth.

Brian, leave us alone!

You're not Chuck and Steve.

But if you were,

I'd make you real story.

Let's go. She's crazy.

Yeah, right.

Yeah, I'm crazy, all right? I'm crazy!

Who's there?

Don't you recognize me?

Carly Beth?

Hey, Sabrina.

Boo.

That mask. It's excellent.

It's really cool.

It's so scary.

And that head.

It looks so real. Where'd you get it?

Oh, it's me.

It's who I used to be.

Used to be?

Forget it.

So where are they? Where's Chuck and Steve?

Oh, we'll find them.

Oh.

You really want to scare
them tonight, don't you?

More than anything else in the world.

Come on, let's go.

It's going to be the best Halloween ever.

It's going to be great.

Yeah, I hope we get some good stuff.

So where'd you buy that mask?

Your mom didn't make it, did she?

No.

Did you buy it at that weird store?

Was it a lot? Can I touch it?

You're not going to believe
this, but it feels like real skin.

I'm serious. It's gross.

What's it made of?

It isn't made of real skin, is it?

Maybe.

Girl, I bet that's gross. It feels so warm.

Be quiet, Sabrina.

I think you should take it off.

Be quiet.

I think it's really disgusting.

I said... But it's
too weird for words.

Stop it.

What are you doing?

Gotcha.

You should have seen your face.

It was the best.

The best?

Did you actually think I
was going to hurt you?

It's not that funny, Carly Beth.

It's a little sick.

I'm sorry.

I'm just staying in character,

you know, getting in the mood.

Well, you're doing a good job.

I like scaring people.

Usually I'm the one that's
always afraid of everything.

Well, next time you decide
to go berserk like that,

please warn me, okay?

Okay.

Trick or treat.

Oh, now that's what I call a scary mask.

What are you supposed
to be, a giant hamster?

No, a cat.

I don't like the other one, Mom.

Too scary.

Oh, it's just a funny mask, hon.

Don't be afraid.

You better watch what you say to
me if you know what's good for you.

Listen, don't frighten her like that.

She's just a little girl.

Well, isn't that too bad?

Hey, cut it out.

And if you don't stop talking,

you'll get what's coming to you, too.

You tell your sick little friend
that I'm going to call the police.

She's not really like that.

Carly Beth, wait up!

She's like that old bag spade.

Carly Beth, that old bag said
she's calling the cops on you.

I'm not afraid of her.

What's happened to you?

You're like somebody else.

Somebody I don't even know.

It's not me, Sabrina.

It's the mask.

The mask made me do it.

The mask? What?

Forget it.

Let's just go back to my house, okay?

No, this is my night.

Halloween is my night.

It's the one night I get to have fun.

The one night I don't have to be.

pitiful, scarable Carly Beth.

Carly Beth, no.

I'm sorry.

Carly Beth!

Yeah!

Oh, what a haul.

Yeah, I got some great stuff.

What should we do now?

Well, we've hit almost every
house in the neighborhood.

Let's go in here.

Really?

Come on, it's Halloween.

Come on.

Are you sure?

Steve, come on.

 men on a dead man's chest.

Yo-ho-ho and away we go.

Treasure.

Pirate's treasure.

Yeah.

This is great.

Yeah.

I'm hating it.

Wouldn't this be easier at your house?

Chuck.

Chuck!

Shh.

I think I heard something.

What?

Over there.

I don't see anything.

Ah!

You're funny.

I've been waiting
to do that all night.

Big deal.

You really get a kick out of everything.

I'm sorry.

It's not that big of a deal.

It's just a joke.

Hey, I think I hear something.

Yeah, right.

No, I mean it.

What is it?

I don't know.

Oh, yes.

You're Carly Bath, right?

You really scared us.

We've been looking for you.

This is Carly Bath's head.

Oh, man.

Poor Carly Bath didn't want
to give up her head tonight.

But I dig it anyway.

How are you making
that weird voice?

97
  
Apologize to her.
Tell Carly Bath you're sorry.

9
  
Apologize?

99
  
For what?

4
74  
For what?

4
4  4
For every time you scared her.

4
  4
For every time you
made people laugh at her.

4
4  4
We were just goofing around.


4  
We only did it
because we liked her.

4
4  
That's no excuse.

4
  4
And it's not how you
show someone you like her.


4  4
Give us a break.

4
7  9
Yeah, really.


  ,
Apologize to her.

4
  
Apologize!

4
4  
Or I promise you you'll
wish you never met her.

4
  
I'm sorry, Carly Bath.

4
  4
I'm sorry.


  
Let's do it again.

4
  
Help me.

4
  
Oh, man.


4  4
You talked.

4
9  
Please help me.

9
  
Help me!


  
Help!


  
Help!


  3
Help!

3
3  3
Help!


  
Bye-bye, scaredy cat.


79  9
Bye-bye.


  
Ah!

7
3  3
Sabrina.


3  9
I was looking everywhere for you.

9
9  9
Where were you?

3
7  79
I guess I got a little lost.


4  4
I was worried about you.


7  
What happened to your hands?

4
:  3
I found the mud.

4
7  4
Where's your sculpture?


3  7
I got rid of it.


  
You got rid of it?

4
  
Hey, don't look at me like that.


4  
Did you find Chuck and Steve?


4  3
Uh...


3  
Yeah.


  
Did you scare them?


  
I think so.

4
  
You didn't hurt them, did you?

4
  
No, of course not.


  
Let's go home, okay?


3  
Whoa.

7
  
I know. I had to get a lot.


  
I had to share with my cousin.


7  
She's got the flu.

4
4,  7
She couldn't go trick-or-treating tonight.

4
4  3
Gotta get this mask off.

4
  
It's boiling inside.


3  3
Good idea.


  
What's the matter?

4
4  7
Ouch.

4
  
Carly Beth, what is it?


3  3
The mask. It won't come off.

4
  
Really? You can't get it off?

4
3  
It's like it's stuck to my skin.

4
3  3
Well, it's gonna sound
pretty dumb if we have

4
3  3
to call the fire department
to come get you.

4
3  4
Shut up and help me!


  4
You really are stuck, aren't you?


  3
Please be very gentle. It really hurts.

4
  7
Um, maybe we can cut it
off with scissors or a knife.

4
73  73
No, no, no, no, no.


  3
That's too dangerous.

4
4  
I don't care, Sabrina.
I'm freaking out here.

4
3  3
Look, look.


  3
One more try and then we'll
ask my mom to help cut it off.


  
Okay.


  
There must be a place I can reach
down and... Ow, ow, ow, no, no, no, no.

3
7  7
Okay.

4
  
Oh.


7  7
What's the matter?


  4
There's no bottom to this mask.

7
  
There's no line in between
the mask and your skin.


  7
There's no place I can reach my hand in.


  3
That's crazy. That's just crazy.

4
3  73
Oh, no, Sabrina.

4
4  4
There's no line.

4
  4
There's no line.


4  4
There's no line here.


4  
I'm going to tell my mom.

4
  
Those eyes. Those eyes in the mirror.

4
4  4
What about them?


4  3
They're not my eyes, Sabrina.

4
  
My eyes don't look like that.

4
  
Try to calm down, Callie-Beth.

4
  7
Those aren't my eyes. Where are my eyes?

4
4  4
Where am I?

4
7  
You're scaring me.


  7
This isn't me. This isn't me in here.


  
What are you supposed to be?

4
  ,
I'm supposed to be me, but I'm not.

4
  
I'm supposed to be me, but I'm not.


4  4
It's all a bad dream, isn't it?

4
4  4
It's all a bad dream.

4
4  4
I'm going to wake up.


  3
I was expecting you.


4  
You can't get it off me.


4  4
I know.

3
7  7
Please take it off me.
I want it off right now.

4
  
I cannot do that.


  
I cannot remove the mask.


  4
What do you mean you can't?

7
3  7
Don't walk away from me. Answer me.


3  7
I cannot remove that mask.


  
Why not?


  
Because it is not a mask.


4,  
It is a real face.


4  4
I don't understand.

3
7  3
How can they be real?

4
3  
They weren't ugly in the beginning.


3  7
They were beautiful.


4,  7
As beautiful as any face could be.

7
4  4
But something went wrong.


  
They changed.


3  7
They became hideous.


4  7
One after another, no matter
what I did to stop the decay,


  
no matter what I did,


3  
deformity set in.

3
  
Ugliness.

4
9  4
Monstrosity.


4  
I'm sick.


,  3
I don't believe any of this.

7
9  4
I called them.


7  9
the unloved ones.

9
  
Because no one will ever love them now.

3
3  
No one.

3
  9
Only you, Carlybeth.

3
3  
You're the only one
who ever wanted them.


3  
The only one who ever loved them.


3  3
No! No!

3
3  
I want it off! I want it off now!

3
4  ,
I hate it!


  
Carlybeth, I'm sorry.

3
  4
But this face.


4  9
is your face now.

4
  
No!

4
4  4
No!

4
  
There may be one possibility.


4  
How many times have
you taken off that mask?


  
Taken off?

4
  4
Once.

4
,  7
There still might be a chance.


  
What? Well, tell me.

4
  4,
We have to take it off.


4,  4
I cannot take it off.


77  
Only you can.


9  3
With the symbol of love.


  
What does that mean?

3
3  
I don't understand what that means.

4
  3
And who are you anyway?


3  4
And how do you know all this stuff?


  4
I was the man who created.

7
  4
these faces, Carlybeth.


  4
You made them?

9
  4
But why?


  
I was like you.


  
I did not love myself.


9  4
I made these faces
to hide behind them,

3
9  ,
to hide my faults.

4
  9
But the faults were inside me.


  4
That's what infected the faces,
turned them into monsters.


  4
Like this one is turning now.

7
9  
Very soon it will join the
other failures on the shelf.


4  
I don't dare show you what's underneath.

9
  3
Or perhaps I should hide it.

7
  3
so that you will
appreciate who you are.

7
  74
and what you've always had.

7
74  4
No! I want my face back!

73
4,  4
I want my self back!

74
4  ,
Quiet, quiet.

7
4  4
You'll awaken them.

7
  
What's happening?

77
9  9
What are they doing?

7
  
Run!

79
  
Run!


  
Carlybeth!


  9
Carlybeth!


  
Stay!

3
4  4
Join us!

Join us!

Love us, Carlybeth!

Please join us, Carlybeth!

Please join us!

Join us!

Stay!

Never!

Carlybeth!

Carlybeth!

Please join us, Carlybeth!

No, I won't!

Stay away from me!

Stay away!

No!

No, no!

This is me!

Get away!

Carlybeth!

Just a mask.

It's just a mask again.

A symbol of love.

That's what he meant.

A symbol of love.

I know.

Carlybeth, please take that mask off!

Please, Carlybeth, please!

The mask off!

I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha!

Mom?

There you are.

Do you realize what time it is?

I love you, Mom.

I really do.

7
7  
What is it? What happened?


  3
I'm sorry, Mom.

9
3  
I didn't mean to scare you.


7  
I've had a long, weird night, that's all.


  9
But everything's okay now.


3  
Well, why didn't you
wear your duck costume?

3
  4
And why weren't you with Sabrina?

4
  4
Sabrina called here twice looking for you.


4  4
Well, let's just say I've learned
a lot about myself tonight, Mom.


  7
Noah, don't put on that mask!

7
4  4
Don't worry, I won't.


  4
Trick or treat!

9
4  
Now that wasn't too scary, was it?

3
  
Let's ask my family.

3
4  3
Mom? Dad?

What did you think?

I think they liked it.

I hope you did, too.

Have a scary day, everyone.

Who's there?

Gotcha!

What a credge! I told you he was a credge!

That's jerk spelled backwards, you credge!

What's your problem, Terra?
What have I ever done to you?

Hey!

That's it! I've had it!

What? She's the one.
She's always doing this to me.

He's lying.

Michael, what are you doing with that?

I want that cleaned up and you too.

I got you good.
Almost as good as at your party.

Gosh, Henry, I wonder if it's a CD.

No, Josh, it's a football.

Awesome. Thanks, Mona.
I don't have this one.

Of course not.
You said it was lame and he threw it out.

But now he'll probably
like it, now that he's in love.

Michael, can you give
me a hand with the cake?

Mom, I don't want Terra at my party.
She's ruining it.

Well, your friends seem
to find her very entertaining.

Yeah, but it's my party.

Michael, take this inside. I'll go get
some candles and you can make a wish.

I already did make a wish, but
Terra the Terrible is still here.

Hey, Michael, aren't you
supposed to serve your guests first?

Watch out, kids.

I've been wanting this
for a long, long time.

A clock. An ugly clock.

A magical clock.

Magical?

That's what Anthony
at the antique store said.

Hey, Dad, what are these numbers for?

They tell the years.

Hey, cool.

Don't touch it.

How can a clock be magical?

Well, the legend is that a strange old man
built the clock over a hundred years ago.

and he put a magical spell on it.

But they say whoever
discovers the magic must beware.

Whoa!

Seems to work fine.

Anthony said there was
something wrong with

the clock, but he wouldn't
tell me what it was.

Terra, stop that.

Now, listen.

I don't want either of you
to put a finger on this clock.

All right?

Yes, Daddy.

Come here.

Terra.

Yes, Daddy.

I thought I told you not to touch this.

If I find that there's anything broken
on this clock, you're in serious trouble.

Yes!

Have fun explaining this one, Terra.

Dad, how's the clock?

What's going on?
My birthday was three days ago.

I get to go to your party.

All right, real funny joke.

Michael, will you tell me
what you want for breakfast?

Because your friends are going to be here
soon and I still have to pick up the cake.

All right, guys, the joke's over.

What joke?

Gosh, Henry, I wonder if it's a CD.

No, Josh, it's a football.

Awesome.

Thanks, Mona. I don't have this one.

Of course not.

You said it was lame and he threw it out.

But now he'll probably
like it, now that he's in love.

This is all too weird.

Everything's happening all over again.

Michael, can you give
me a hand with the cake?

The cake? Terra!

Not this time.

Michael, will you take this inside?

I'll go get the candles and
then you can make a wish.

What's happening to me?

Maybe I'm losing my mind.

Michael, aren't you supposed
to say the guess first?

Enough, Michael.
You've been going on about this all day.

I'm telling you, I'm caught in a time warp.

It doesn't feel warm.

I'm not sick.

I'm sorry you didn't like your birthday.

I didn't like it twice.

Look, you guys gotta believe me.
I woke up and it was three days ago.

Michael, try to get some sleep, okay?

You're gonna feel a
lot better in the morning.

Like I always say, tomorrow's another day.

Better be.

Mom!

Mikey, what is it, sweetie?

Are you having bad dreams?

Oh, I know what it is.

You're just excited because
it's your birthday tomorrow.

Actually, it is tomorrow already.

Happy birthday, Mikey.

My big boy is six years old.

Six?

What's wrong, little buddy?

Hair!

I can't be six.

I'm twelve.

Of course you're six.

No, I'm twelve.

Honey, it's his birthday.
Let him be twelve if he wants.

Wait a minute. If I'm six, where's Tara?

Tara? Who's Tara?

Oh, Tara.

He has an invisible friend.

Tell me, Mikey, what does Tara look like?

Tara's gone.

Gone? Disappeared?

That means I'm next.

Michael, close my office
door and get back into bed.

Time's going backwards!

What imagination.
I think we've got a writer on our hands.

That'd make a great
science fiction story, son.

Time going backwards.

Backwards. The cuckoo's head.

That must be it.
I've got to turn it back around.

Michael? Michael?

It's gone.

The cuckoo clock is gone.

The cuckoo clock is gone.

What cuckoo clock?
We don't have a cuckoo clock.

Stupid!

Don't call your father stupid.

Not him. Me.

Dad's not going to buy the
clock for another six years.

He's delirious.

The antique store. That's where it is.
I've got to get there.

The only place you have
to go is to bed, young man.

It's late.
And the last thing we need is a...

...is a grumpy birthday boy.

Hey, birthday boy!

How about a giraffe?

I'm a twelve-year-old mind
trapped in a six-year-old body.

How about... ...an octopus?

Well, my time's up.

What's wrong, Michael?

I've got to get out of here. I've got
to get downtown to the antique store.

What's an antique?

I'm getting younger by the day.

It's your birthday. You're getting older.

You don't understand.

Today, I'm six. Tomorrow, I may be nothing.

When you're nothing,
can I have your presents?

You can have them all right now.

Just don't tell my mom where I'm going.
I'm busting out of here.

Michael, where are you going?

Never mind. Presents!

7  7
Hey, kid.


97  97
You got the time?


3  4
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!


4  4
Your friend said you'd be here.

7
9  
What's the matter with you, Michael,
running away from your party like that?


4  
Dad!

9
4  
You know you're not
allowed down here by yourself.


  ,
I'm very angry with you.


7  7
I've got to get to the clock.
It's very, very important.


  3
I don't even want to discuss it.


  
I'm very disappointed in you.


  
Come on. We're going home before
your mother worries us off to death.


  
I don't care.


7  
You can keep all your small dogs.


  
You keep all your black,
white, brown and spotted dogs.


  
I'll keep Clifford.


  
Wouldn't you?


4  4
The end.


  4
Read me another, Dad.


4  4
Please, Dad. Just one more.

3
  9
Come on, please.

4
4  4
It's time for lights out.


7  7
Is he still awake?


9  ,
He's afraid to go to sleep.

7
  4
Michael, I want you to stop it
with this time travel business.


  
You're not going to disappear.

9
4  
Tara did.


  
Stop with this Tara. Who's Tara?


4  4
Honey, maybe if you just read him
one more story, it'll calm him down.


4  
I've been reading for two solid hours.


3  
Mom, Dad, don't argue over me.


4  
It's not worth it.


  
I'm not going to be here
much longer anyhow.


7  4
He doesn't seem to be warm.


4  7
Listen, buddy, I'll
leave your night light on.


  7
Try, please, to go to sleep.


4  
Everything's going to be just fine.


3  
Good night, son.


  
Not good night, goodbye.


  3
I'm alive.

3
  
Wait a minute.

Spinning dinosaurs?

What's that smell?


4  4
Oh, no!

Uh-oh.

Oh, no.

Anything but that.

Hey, what's with my little man?

His temperature's normal.

How would my little buddy like
to go for a nice walk downtown?

Wait a minute.

We could be onto something.

Yeah, maybe do some window shopping.

Getting warmer.

Take a look in that antique store.

Bingo!

What do you think, hon?

Let's not go to Anthony's.

What?

I like Anthony's.

You're  years old, act like it.

But keep your hands off my cuckoo.

Okay, guys, lunch is ready.

Mom.

Mom, I love you.

Oh, Mike.

I'll get Tara.

Who's Tara?

Michael, come here.

I think I found the flaw.

Look, the year  is missing.

That's the year Tara would have been born.

Who's Tara?

Nobody, Dad.

Nobody.

Come and eat, you nut.

Yeah, I'll be there in a second.

So Tara has never been born.


0  ,0
I suppose there's some way to
go back in time and get her, right?

7
  90
I guess I probably ought to do that.


9  
And I will.

  :
One of these days.


  ,0
I love to scare my little brother Randy.


,0  0
I tell him scary stories about
monsters until he just begs me to stop.

And I'm always teasing him by
pretending to see monsters everywhere.

I guess that's why no one believed
me the day I saw a real monster.

Until it was too late.

Randy! Haven't you ever
heard of the Razortooth Toebiter?

What do you mean, Toebiter?

It got Becky and Lila next door.

While they were playing
in their wading pool.

Couldn't they see it coming?

The Toebiter can
camouflage itself as anything.

Even water.

You're lying!

Ask Becky to take off her shoe.

She'll show you. Ask her.

Don't use your foot!

Do it real quick.
  
Get away!

My toes! My toes!

Mom, the Toebiter got Lucy!

Oh, Randy, calm down.


  
You know there's no
such thing as a Toebiter.

3
  ,
Yes, there is! All her toes are gone!

4
740  3
Lucy, would you please
stop scaring your little brother?


3  0
Oh, Mom. It was just a joke.


30  4,
How did all your toes grow back?

7
4,  0
Haven't I asked you not
to tell him monster stories?


0  40
Actually, the Toebiter
gave me back my toes.

9
40  9
Because I promised to cut yours
off and give them to him tonight.


70  0
No!

3
0  0
Lucy!

3
  3
What's the point of having a little
brother if you can't torture him?


30  ,
Lucy, don't you have
reading rangers at the library?


0  
Why don't you go and bother
Mr. Mortman for a while?

3
0  
Well, what did you think?

3
  0
Two thumbs down.


30  970
But Lucy, black beauty is a classic.

3
0  
It would have been better
if the horse had two heads.


  
And big old gnarly fangs.

40
  
Why don't you go pick another book?

4
  0
Hey, Lucy, what are you getting?

4
  03
Frankenstein.


0  0
Cool!


04  04
Are you sure, Lucy?

4
  0
Frankenstein is a classic as well.

4
  07
Yeah, but this one's got a monster.


970  0
Wouldn't it be cool if
there were real monsters?

4
  
Well, I'm not so sure, Aaron.


0  
Most people like to be
frightened in movies or stories.

0
  03
Not in real life.


0  0
Aaron, you ever notice
anything weird about Mortman?


  3
Like his creepy, beady little eyes.

3
0  90
And his sweaty little hands.


30  
When he gave me my book, it
was so slimy I almost dropped it.


  
Yeah?


  
Ugh.

7
  
Oh, my blades.


  0
I forgot them at the library.

9
  0
Oh, man, I gotta get home.

0
0  0,
Oh, no big deal.


  
I'll see you later.

Probably a classic.

Don't you say hi anymore.

07  
Hi, Dad.

7
07  07
Dad, there's a monster at the library.

79
  
Lucy, please.

0
70  
What kind of monster?


0  0
Could you give us a hand here, please?


  
A big, slimy, disgusting one.

3
  
That eats bugs.

4
  0
Oh, I hope this monster thing was
just a phase you were going through.


  04,0
Life is a phase I'm going through.


  0
Well, could you go
through it, please, after

7
0  
you've washed your
hands and set the table?


0  0
Dad, this is no joke.

9
0  
Larry, you're making them too big.

90
  0,
I happen to like big meatballs.

9
  03
Doesn't anyone here believe me?

9
03  
His eyes popped out of his
head, and he was eating bugs.

93
  0,
And everyone here thinks I'm making it up.


0  
Gee, I wonder why.


  
What? You don't believe me either?


04  0
Calm down, Lucy. You're totally obsessed.


0  0
Ooh, big word.


7  
Well, you'll believe me soon enough.


  7
I'll prove it to you.


  
Didn't you think that the monster was the
most sympathetic character in this story?


  3
Do you believe in monsters?


  
Perhaps we all have a
little monster in us, Lucy.

3
  
Why don't you go pick
another book while I tidy up?

4
9  
Okay.


  
I'll see you tomorrow, then.


  
Yeah, right. See ya.

7
  
It's dinner time, my furry friends.


  3
Don't forget the G.

9
4  
My favorite.


4  4
Who's there?


  4,
Stupid.


  
Lucy!


3  4
Keep running, little one.


  
I love fast food.


  
Watering.


  
Lucy!


  
I know you're in there.


  9
You're just making me hungrier.


  ,
Dinner is served.


  
Come back! Come back!


  
You captured me from me.
You didn't trick it.


  
Ha, ha, ha!


  
You were such a terrible monster.
How'd you get away?


4  4
I think the flash blinds him.


4  4
But I got the picture. I got my proof.


4  
You're forgetting something, Lucy.


4  
Your library card has your address on it.
Mortman knows where you live.


  
So what?


  7
He could be on his way
to your house this minute.


  
That's not funny, Aaron.


  9
If I were you, I'd get
out of there right now.


  
Good evening, Lucy,
may I come in for a minute?


  
No, my parents aren't home right now.


  
I mean, they'll be home any minute.


  
I mean, they're in the bathroom.


4  4
Mom, is Dad still cleaning his rifle?


  
It's okay, Lucy, it's really
you that I've come to see.


4  
You left your backpack at the library.


7  
I have it right here.


4  4,
This is yours, isn't it?


4  4
Could you maybe just leave
it on the doorstep, please?


74  ,
Wouldn't it be easier if you opened
the door and let me hand it to you?


  
I'll just set it down here.

4
  
Thank you.


9  
Oh, it's no trouble.


  
It's on my way.

7
  
I look forward to our next little chat.


  4
Mom, he was here.

9
  
Mortman was here.


  
We've got to get this
film developed right away.


  
I took a picture that
proves he's a monster.


  
Calm down, Lucy.


4  
He followed me home today.


  4,
He followed you home for no reason.


4  
Well, I forgot my knapstack at the
library and he brought it over, but...


  
Well, that was very nice of him.


  
He lives all the way across town.


  
It wasn't on his way at all.


  
Come on, we're wasting time.


  
The photo place is going to close.


  
Now, Lucy... Please.


  
Let me see.


  
Let me see.


  
I knew it.


  
Let's go.


  
Nice work.


  
Randy, get into the car, please.


  
You heard your father.


  9
You're quite the photographer.


  
Mr. Mortman, what are you doing here?


  
Have you been thinking
about monsters again?


9  
Mr. Mortman, thanks very much for
bringing home Lucy's backpack today.


7  
Oh, it was nothing.

4
  
It was on my way.


,  97
Mr. Mortman, why don't you come
over for dinner tomorrow night?


  9
Lucy's been talking a great deal about you.

It would be nice to get to know you better.

Well, that would be lovely.

Thank you.

It's been so long since I've
had a home-cooked meal.

Don't you see he's a monster?

The fact that he's not
in this picture proves it.

I don't care if he's a drooling werewolf.

He's coming for dinner.

Remember your best behavior.

This is very kind of you.

Oh, it's nothing.

Our pleasure, really.

Good evening, Lucy.

Nice to see you again, young Randy.

Will you be joining us for
Reading Rangers next year?

Can I sleep on it?

Of course.

Hi.

Motel.

A lovely house.

Lucy.

Offer Mr. Mortman a meatball.

Delicious.

Now listen, both of you.


  0
You can never, ever let anyone
know that we are monsters.


0  0
We know that.


70  0
And we can't have any
other monsters in town, either.


0  
And do you know why?


0  0
Because they might tell
other people about us.


  0
And they'd be frightened,
and they'd chase us away.


0  0
Or worse.


0  00
Mr. Mortman's the first monster
to come around in 0 years.


7  40
Besides us, of course.


0  
That's why it took us so
long to believe you, Lucy.

0
  0
And when you two get bigger,
you're going to get your training fangs.


0  0
That's right.


740  0
Before long, you and Randy
will be able to transform...

0  00
Just like your father and me.

4

Oh, no! Another one!


0  0
Not another Mortman.

So somebody's coming to get us, right?


00  03
You can't just leave us here!


00  
Get back here!


  00
I can't believe he just took off.


0  
Maybe he's some kind of psycho.


04  09
No one's ever going to find us out here.

Quit being such a baby.

I'd like to lay down a few rules.

70
0,0  00
One, no leaving your bunks at
night and sneaking out anywhere.

7
  
Who would do such a thing?

7
0  
Two, the girls' camp is
completely out of bounds.

73
  0
Girls are not part of this program.

the most important one of all,

7
  00
you write home to your
parents every day, every day.

79
00  00
Okay, that's it.

0

3
0  
The forbidden bunk.

4
00  00

Not enough chips in your cookie?

Ah! Ah!

Hey!

Jane, get the window!

Jane!

You're going to get me to a doctor.

or a nurse or something, aren't you?

Hang in there, Mike, okay?

Just stay calm.

Okay, who threw the sheet out the window?

He did.

You're the counselor?

Uh, the name's Larry.

Larry, we got to get this guy to a nurse.

Why'd you throw a perfectly
clean sheet out the window?

There was a snake in it! A snake!

It bit Mike!

Oh.

Oh, man.

Get that out of my face.

I just ate.

How's your hand?


9  
It's not just my hand anymore.

1
  
I'm numb up and down my whole side.


  
You should be in the hospital.


  
Hey!

11
  4
What's your name, son?


  
Billy.


9  44
You were talking during
the camp song, Billy.


4  
That's not allowed here.

1
  
What's so important?

1
  
Mike's arm's all swollen up.


  
I think you should see a doctor.

A doctor?

A snake bit me.

Who's your counselor, son?

Larry.

Larry, why wasn't I told about this?

Yeah, Larry, why wasn't I told?

Let me see that, son.

Ow!

Good. That's good.

You still have feeling in it.

But it really hurts.

I know.

I've been running this camp for 3
years and I've seen all sorts of bites.

This is really nothing to worry about.

Told you, wimp.

I promise you, the swelling and the pain

will be gone by morning.

Really?

Trust me.

I embarrassed Billy a minute ago

when all he was trying
to do was help a friend.

Now, looking out for each other is
what Camp Nightmoon is all about.

And that makes Billy number
one camper in my books tonight.

Three cheers for Billy!

Hooray!

Hooray!

Hooray!

Hey, guys, wait up.

Feeling okay, Mike?

Yeah, okay.

I think I could eat something.

Oh, hey, hey, listen.

I, uh...

I got a marshmallow.

I just picked that up on the trail.

Look, guys, there it is.

The forbidden bunk.

We gotta check that baby out.

You in?
  
I don't know. Maybe.

Don't tell me the number
one camper's chicken.

I'm not a chicken.

Hey, hey, maybe the number one's
afraid of doing the number eight.

Not it. I just don't think
it's a good idea, that's all.

You got time to change your eyes.

I'm not trying to be a downer, man.

It just really hurts.

Is this supposed to be morning?

You know where I come from.

Hey, where's Mike?

Maybe he's out picking marshmallows.

There's no blankets on his bed.

If you got a problem,
you take it up with him.

Now get going.

Larry, Mike's gone.

Well, if it isn't the little Eagle Scout.

Why aren't you guys at your table?

Where's Mike?

Go back to your table.
This one's for counselors only.

Is he okay?

Yeah, his stuff's gone.

Did Uncle Al send him home?

Yeah, maybe.

Forget it, Billy. Let's go. Come on.

0  
Counselors aren't supposed
to talk about that stuff.


9  0
Yeah, he might give us poor
little kids nightmares, huh?

Okay, you guys, get your faces
out of your bowls and listen up.

Who's for a serious game of baseball?

Take him to the lodge,
Billy, and ice down this lump.

You've got some tents to set up.

Tonight is survival night.

Batter up.

A major night mood
tradition where each night.

a different bunk gets
to sleep under the stars,

live off the land.

Bunk four, you're up first.

Dear Mom and Dad, I miss you a lot.

Hope you're okay.

I'm all right, but there's
something strange about this camp.

Weird things have been happening.

My counselor Larry's a real jerk.

But Uncle Al, the camp
director, seems like an okay guy.


  
Maybe it's just me.


  9
Maybe I'm just a little nervous.


7  4
First time at camp and all.

Dory was gone.
It's the same thing at the boys camp.

What's this the first day I came years ago.

George.

Hand them out one weapon per boy.

What is this? Shut up, Billy. We have
a runaway reported from the girls camp.

She's brunette average height.
We suspect she's close by in the woods.

possibly on campgrounds Search
everywhere aim carefully. We do not

want her getting away.
What said shut up, Billy

Are you saying we're supposed
to shoot her? That's what

I said, Billy. She broke the
big rule. No, this is insane

You can't just go killing people killing.

Who said anything about killing?

These weapons are
loaded with tranquilizer

darts, we want to
stop the girl not kill her.

Or do you have a problem with that Billy?
Do you have a problem?

I won't do it. Is this any way for my
number one camper to be acting camps over?

Nobody else is gonna
die die. Nobody has died

here Billy. This is a
summer camp or a liar

What about Mike snakebite the saber-eating
Roger J and Colin drowning Mike J Colin?

We have no campers by those names.

Liar, you're a liar. Calm down.
I think I know what's going on here Larry.

Do we have any boys with those
names never heard of a George?

Nope. Now listen to me Billy.

Sometimes if you get too homesick

Way to go, Brooke.
Esmeralda's a way cool part.

Thanks, Corey. What's wrong?
You don't seem too excited.

I'd be careful if I were you.

Yeah, Brooke. Tina's your understudy. She
might poison you so she can play the lead.

She'd never do that.
Throw me down a flight of stairs? Maybe.

Real funny. I wouldn't want the lead.
Haven't you heard? This play is cursed.

Did you cast a spell on it?

What are you talking about, Tina?

I'm serious. My grandfather told me about
it. He went to this school 7 years ago.

And you want to know the weird thing?
He hasn't graduated yet.

Fine. Forget it.

Come on, Tina. Tell us.

It all started the year
the school was built.

The drama club was putting
on the same play we are.

The night of the play, the boy who was
supposed to play the Phantom disappeared.

They searched everywhere.
His parents were freaking out.

They called the police.
But they never found the body.

A year later, when they tried to put on the
play again, his ghost appeared on stage.

Come with me.

Esmeralda, I've come for you.
Can I borrow some lunch money?

Oh, Phantom, you already owe me $.
I hope you starve.

Take off that mask, please.

Get into the character.


90  40
There will be no more visits from the
Phantom unless it's in the play. I mean it.

9
30  70
We shouldn't be doing this play,
Miss Walker. My grandfather said...

30
7  30
I don't want to hear that old story, Tina.

3
40  30
The only haunting we
need to be concerned

3
  0
about right now is the
one that's in this play.


0  0
Let's go through the show.


3  40
Cory, you are Carlo.
You are Esmeralda's father.

3
40  30
Hi, Dad.

3
  4
You own a theater and
you think it's haunted.


0  0
Zeke.

3
40  40
I'm the Phantom who lives in the basement.


0  0
Right. And you are secretly in love with
the theater owner's daughter, Esmeralda.

40
  
Do I have to be?


0  0
Now, Esmeralda, the Phantom kidnaps you.

4
30  0
Then how come I stay in love with him?


  0
Oh, because you're
attracted to his mystery.


40  30
But your boyfriend finds out about it,
he kills him, and that breaks your heart.

4
3  0
And the Phantom was known as a
ghost, haunting the theater forever.

4
30  30
Which is what's going to
happen if we do this play.


3  
Tina.

4
30  40
Uh, Mrs. Walker.


0  40
Not now, Cory.

0

Maybe the Phantom will kidnap
Esmeralda again, huh, Brookie?

Uh, Mrs. Walker.


  
Uh, Mrs. Walker!

A trap door!

He must have accidentally
pressed the switch.

Awesome.

I don't want anybody else going down there.

This trap door has not
been used in years and

Come to eternal darkness.


  40
What's it doing here?


0  4
Oh, well, the school had a bill for
the first production of the Phantom.

3

Let me try.

4
40  0
No!


  740
Not until I know what's entirely safe.


70  70
Is that clear?

7

Zeke?


90  0
Yeah, sure, sure.

Alright, now let's talk character.

Listen, Zeke.

77

This trap door.

7
  30
I dreamt about it last night.

79
40  40
I've never seen it before.

0
3  09
Maybe the haunting has begun.


  
I just think it was kind of weird.

Life is weird and it's
about to get weirder.

Where are we?


  
I don't know.


04,  
We're not in the basement.

0
  
We're way below the basement.

0
00  
Why would the platform
come all the way down here?

03
0  0
Maybe this is where the phantom brings
Esmeralda after a long day of haunting.

04
  
Let's go back.

0
  
Bad news, Esmeralda.

0
  70
Can't find the switch.

07
  
We may be down here all night.

There has to be a switch.

It's going up!


  
Jump on!


  
Come on!

3
90  
Gotcha!

It stopped.

Oh, man.

Give me a boost.

Zeke!
  
Come on!

Help me up!

Zeke!

It's about time.

Who are you?

Emil.

The night janitor.

What are you doing here?

School's closed.

We had a late rehearsal.

How do you know about the trap door?

Miss Walker showed it to us.

Didn't she tell you how dangerous it is?

Stay away.

Stay away!

Yes!

I knew we shouldn't have gone down there.

Stay away!

Excuse me.

You're in my seat.

You're right.

Guess it doesn't really matter.

First day?

Yeah.

Brooke Rogers.

Hi, Brian Coulson.

I just moved here from up north.

You're in the phantom, right?


  40
Yes.

I play the tragic heroine.

Shouldn't you be in
drama class, Miss Rogers?


4,  40
Just getting my script, Mr. Levy.

1
  
Nice try, but it didn't work.


0970  0970
Huh?


0990  090
Your mask.

1
00  0930
What are you talking about?

1
09  
I didn't write that.


09  09
Then who did?

1
  00
The phantom.


  0
It's obvious.

0
0990  
No! No!

1
3  
Not bad.


  
Come on, Brooke.

3
:4  
So does this mean you like my costume?

4
7  ,
I should have known, you jerk.


  :
Hey, I was just playing around.


:  4
This phantom stuff's
starting to get to you, Brooke.

7

Aren't you even going to
tell me how good I look?


4  4
Come on, let's rehearse.

9
1  
Phantom, are you there?

1
1  4
Please, Phantom, come to me.


4  
Learned your lines yet, Brooke?


4  4
Most of them.


  1
Remember, this play is cursed.


  
Be careful.

1
  
Brian!

1
  4
If you're done painting that
stage, you can start on the flats.


4  
Aren't you glad you moved here?

1
  1
I'm just happy to be
part of the production.


  
Brooke, let's rehearse the
argument with your father.


4  4
Break a leg, Brooke, as they say.

1
  ,
Brooke?


  
Go to your room, Esmeralda.

3
4  7
I will not lose my daughter to a monster.

4
1  4
But father, I love him.


7  
Go away, Esmeralda.


7  
I'm warning you.

7
3  
Go away.


4  3
Last warning, stay
away, Esmeralda, or else.

9
4  
I don't like this.


  
Neither do I.

1
3  3
Sorry I'm late.


  4
You have gone too far this time, Zeke.

3
1  4
Huh?

4
1  3
You know what I'm talking about.


  
Trying to scare everybody
while I'm sick of it.


  4
No way, I wasn't even here.

7
  4
I had a dentist appointment.


9  
Honest.

9
4  
Ask my mom.

1
  
What a mess.


7  1
Hey, this paint leaves a trail.


1  1
Let's follow it.


1  
Maybe it'll prove who did it.

We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

I want the truth.

I can't believe anyone could be so stupid.

Zeke!

Is this your locker, Zeke?

Brooke, I'm telling you, I
don't know what's going on.

Open it.

This is nuts, man.

What?

Zeke!

It's not mine.

Get the janitor, Zeke.

Somebody's gonna have
to clean up this mess.

It's not mine.

Now.

He wouldn't do this.

Really, Miss Walker?

I'm calling your parents, Zeke.

You're out of the play.

And if anything else happens,
I'm canceling the production.

Maybe we shouldn't be doing this play.

You really think it's haunted?

You really didn't do it?


  1
It's not me.

3
4  
If you didn't do it, then who did?


1  
What about Tina?

4
7  
Tina doesn't have the guts.


  4
We better figure this out
before somebody gets hurt.

4
  9
Mr. Johnson, there's a
big mess in the auditorium.


4  1
Can you help us clean it up?


  
Gotta wait till morning.

4
  
Can't the night guy do it later?

4
  
Night guy?


  
What night guy?

4
  3
Emile, the night janitor.


3  3
Night janitor?


3  
There's no night janitor.

1
  4
I knew that weirdo wasn't a janitor.


4,  4
I don't know about this.

3
  93
Maybe we should call the cops.


9  
No, we can't.


7  3
If the cops come around here, Miss
Walker will cancel the play for sure.


  
You can't go, Brooke.

7
9  9
The note, the backdrop.


  
The phantom wants Esmeralda.

9
3  
That's you.


1  
Maybe a dream was a warning.

1
1  
If the situation was
reversed, would you go?


  
I don't think they'd let me play Esmeralda.

3
9  9
I'm going.

4
3  
He's down here, you guys.


  
I know it.


  3
But what if he's a... If what?

7
3  1
What if Emile's a ghost?


  9
I don't believe in ghosts.

9
  4
It's going back up.

7
  
What do we do?

71
  
Now what?

7
  1
We've got no choice.

73
4  4
Come on.

74
  99
This place is too creepy.

7
  3
It's just too weird.

7
9  3
Nobody can live down here.

77
93  99
It's disgusting.

7
3  9
Look, something's there.

79
7  7
Let's go.


  
Somebody lives here.

1
3  4
Why didn't you listen to me?


4  
The phantom.

3
9  4
I told you to stay away.

You should have listened to me.

Run for it.

You should have listened to me.

Emile!

Come on!

Who's there?

Mr. Levy?

Thank you, officer.

Well, it looks like that
Emile character got away.

But we found a hat and
this old mask down there.

And the officer thinks
that he was a homeless

man who was living
underneath the stage.

That's why he gave us those warnings,
to keep us from finding his home.

You kids didn't use the best judgment.

If we didn't have a staff meeting tonight,
you might have been stuck down there.

We're sorry.

Well, I'm sorry too, Zeke,
because I was wrong about you.

Does this mean Zeke's back in the play?

30
0  10
I suppose it does.

303

The phantom lives.

Can I help you?

I was just trying to see
who was playing in there.


0,  
Hi, I'm Adele Hawkins.
This is my son, Jerry.


  
Ah, Mr. Hawkins.

7
  00
I'm Dr. Shriek.


00  04,
I know it's a funny name,
but it's a real attention-getter.

9
  
Have you ever played an
instrument before, Mr. Hawkins?

0
40  
Uh, I can play Stairway
to Heaven on the kazoo.

1
  03
The piano is considerably more demanding.


00  0
But with hands like these, I'm
sure you'll be a perfect student.

3
00  00
You'll have to excuse me.
We just moved into a new house.

4
  
Come back in an hour.


  00
All righty. Um, um...


70  
Come with me, Mr. Hawkins.

7
00  
What was all that high-tech
stuff at the front door?


  0
Security. We're very isolated here.

9
03  0
But our janitor, Mr. Toggle,
is a mechanical genius.

0
00  90
He can build anything.

1

How long before I play rock and roll?

1

All in good time.

Today, we will learn the C major scale.

Watch me.


  00
What happened to your hands?


  
They just don't work like they used to.

7
0  04
But you...


04  04
You have marvelous hands.


00  04,
Simply marvelous.

0

Thanks, Dr. Shree.

Remember, Mr. Hawkins, practice.

The world-famous
explorer was hopelessly lost.

But when he saw the words,


40  40
Do not enter,

7
30  30
The drumbeat of adventure Began
to pound inside his fearless heart.

Down, down, down Went the world-famous
explorer Down into the forbidden world.

Let's go.

The world-famous explorer.

Was starting to wish he was home in bed.

Oh, my God.

No, not there.

Are you looking for the front door?


0  40
It's upstairs.


0  770
This is the recital hall.

Oh, sorry.

What's that?


10  10
Oh, that is my floor sweeper.

That's what he looks for.

What did I do?


  30
Stay away from the Shriek.

1

It's evil.

1
30  30
Evil.


70  
Did you see her?

1

Did you see her?

The ghost.

1
30  30
It was playing the piano.


0  0
There.

3
1  1
That's just bonkers.

4
10  10
That's all you saw?


  10
But I saw it.


  4,
I did.

7
00  00
Come on, let's go to bed.


10  10
Yeah, come on, honey.


0  40
Son, we're worried about you.

10
  
Maybe you need some help.


30  4,00
You mean like a psychiatrist?

1
770  
Well, it's just somebody to talk to.


0  40
You think I'm crazy?


7  00
No, of course not.

1
0  0
Just because I don't want to
go back to the Shriek school.

1
0  
Well, it's the reason
you don't want to go back.


0  
You guys don't believe
me that I saw a ghost.

1
  0
Maybe, maybe I was just sleepwalking.

1
  0
Honey, we would never force
you to keep taking lessons.


0  4,0
But if you could just give it one more try.


  
You know what the best
feeling in the world is, Jer?


10  10
It's confronting the things
you're most afraid of.


10  10
Finding out it's no big deal.


10  100
It's all in the mind.

1
70  
Oops, sorry.

1

That's fine, Jerry.

I need your hands.

You were just a lazy boy.

Very clever, but lazy.

You could have mastered all

I practiced every day.

I'm here in Egypt visiting my
Uncle Ben and Cousin Sari.


10  70
My Uncle Ben's an archaeologist.

He's really cool.


0  0
He knows all about ancient civilizations.


0  30
My Cousin Sari thinks she
knows a lot, but she's okay.


3  ,0
We're on the site of a secret dig.


,0  3
My Uncle has discovered a pyramid that
is the tomb of an ancient Egyptian prince.


0  40
The pyramid is like this dark underground
maze full of secret passages and dead ends.


40  0
It's pretty spooky, but I'm not afraid.


40  1
I'm psyched that I
get to be one of the


303  
first people inside the
tomb of Prince Khoru.

1
0  
Or at least we hope it is.


  0
If it is, you'll be famous, Dad.


0  
There's a real mummy in here?

1
0  
Duh! That's why they built it, Gabe.

1
0,  01
What's this?


  0
Hey, give me that. It's my summoner.
I bought it at the airport.

1
  
A summoner?

1
  
The guy said it could call forth the dead.

0
0  
He said it was a real mummy's hand.

1
  0
I hope you didn't pay too much.
That's one of the oldest scams around.


04,0  
Hey.

3
  07
Oh, it's warm.

4
  03
That's because it
communicates with the dead.


0  30
That's because you've been
carrying it around in your pocket.


90  30
I'll tell you what. You can try
out your summoner on the prince.

7
3  90
But first we have to find him.


0  4
Wait a minute.
Let me get a picture of you guys.

9
0  40
Okay.

30
0  10
Move a little to your left.
I want to get those drawings in the shot.


70  0
They're called hieroglyphics.

3
0  0
Whatever. I want them in the shot.


0  40
It's very simple.


  ,
You just press the little
button and a picture pops out.

3
  0
Even you can do it.

3
0  0
I know how to do it.


40  
Could have fooled me.

Just smile, Sari.

That's better.

40
0  0
All right. Come on. Let's go.


0  0
That's weird.

4
0  0
Come on, Gabe. We've got to stick together.


0  30
Sari, come here.


3  1
Do you know what these mean?

4
0  ,
It's all about the journey
of the soul after death.

4
70  90
Can't you just feel the
presence of death here with us?


70  0
Yeah. Creepy.

4
1  
I'd hate to be stuck in here all by myself.


  
Wouldn't you?

0

Sari?

Sari?

Sari?

Grab it, Gabe. Grab the rope.

71
0  9
It's there.

7
0  40
Gabe, this is fantastic.

73
  0
This lion's head is Prince
Hodor's sacred seal.

74
0  40
And you discovered it.

7
0  071
This is the entrance to the prince's tomb.

7
40  0
He fell into it. That doesn't count.

77
0  0
Sure, it does.
And we're going into the tomb tomorrow.

7
3  
What about the, uh...

79
3  0
Snakes?
Won't your summoners scare them away?

0
40  0
If we send you in
first, that'll scare them.

1
40  
Probably even wake up the prince.


4  40
Hey, all right, you two.
I'll send in a work crew.

3
40  0
Clear out all the snakes.

4
40  740
There were some spiders, too.


70  0
Hey, my summoner. It's gone.


  40
Are you sure it's not in your tent?

7
  
Yeah, I had it with me in
the pyramid, remember?


74  74
Well, then you probably dropped
it when you... Became hysterical?

9
70  70
I'm sure the crew will find it.

90
790  0
In the meantime, here's a little
something I picked up for you.


0  10
What is it? Some kind of old glass?

9
  10
Uh-uh.
It's the petrified sap of ancient trees.

93
1  40
It's called amber. Look at it.
Look right inside it.


0  7
There's a bug.


  0
That's right.
It's an ancient scarab beetle.


  30
It was trapped in the
amber 4,0 years ago.


3  3
Great present, Dad. A dead bug.


0  0
It's totally cool.


30  40
Scarabs were very important
to the ancient Egyptians.


4  40
You see, they believed
that to keep a scarab.

1
0  
meant that you would live forever.


0  0
It's really 4,0 years old?

3
0  90
Uh-huh.

4
  
Yes, it's true.


30  30
Knock, knock.


  0
Dr. Hassad, I'm so glad I caught you.

7
70  0
Excuse me. Do I know you?


  90
Nila Rahmed.
I'm a reporter with the Cairo Sun.

9
0  
I thought you all called
yourselves journalists these days.

0
90  ,
Well, I guess I'm just
an old-fashioned girl.

1
  
My newspaper heard that you have
discovered the tomb of Prince Khoro.


10  0
Well, I don't know what they heard.

3
1  10
I'm not sure we've discovered the tomb yet.

4
0  0
That's even better.


70  0
I want exclusive.


0  70
I want to come with you and write
up the discovery from the beginning.

7
0  0
Well, then, you should
start with my nephew, Gavir.


  30
He's the one who discovered
the door to the tomb.

In fact, so far, he's the only
one who's actually seen it.

Are you an archaeologist, too?

No, just clumsy.

He fell into it.

Well, some of the greatest
discoveries happen by accident.

Strange.

We are twins.

How very unusual.

Yours is empty.

I think it's prettier without the dead bug.

The scarab's supposed to be for good luck.

I hope mine is not bad luck.

Here. I took this picture.

It is.

The seal of Prince Khoro.

Madam.

Where shall I put these?

Just leave them over there.

That photo.

Surely you do not... There's
nothing to worry about, Shafiq.

9
70  9
No one must enter the tomb.

0
30  
It is cursed. Someone will die.

1
,  3
Enough.


3  3
My apologies.

3
3  04
I cannot stay.

4
  
What was that all about?


  
Let me rest in peace.


  
You can read that stuff?

7
  0730
What does it mean?


  
It's a warning.

9
00  
To scare off grave robbers.

Sometimes these tombs
contain a great deal of treasure.

And there are some superstitious people
who still believe that there's a curse.

Like you, Gabe.

It's said that more than one man
has tried to rob the sacred tomb.

What happened?

They never returned.

The ancient legend says that if you
repeat the sacred words three times...

The mummy will be awakened
from his sleep to seek his vengeance.

But of course, that's just superstition.

Is that not so?

Just think.

A boy from America will be
the first one to see the mummy.

Yeah.

Spiders! Spiders! Spiders!

What was that?

A little jumpy, Gabe.

Of course I'm a little jumpy.

I mean, you heard that driver.

What if he's right?
What if there's a curse?

Okay, everybody ready?

We're about to enter a room that
no one has seen for 4,000 years.

It's empty.

What happened?

It's another trick to
discourage grave robbers.

It's a false tomb.

Maybe all we have to do is say the
sacred words and let the prince come to us.

I wouldn't do that.

What's the matter?

You're afraid the mummy's
really going to come to life?

Well, no, but...
What then? Say it.

What do you mean?

You chicken.

Happy?

Maybe Khoru's listening.

It's probably just some
cracks in the wall let in the wind.

Gabe, what's that?

My summoner!

How did it get here?

Hey!


  
It won't let go!

0
40  10
Help! Uncle Ben, help!

1
10  0
It won't let go! Help! Help me!


  40
Give me a break, Gabe.

3
40  0
No, help!

4
40  40
What are you doing?


0  790
What happened?


0  990
The wall swung around.

7
770  770
Help!


40  40
Help!

9
40  
This thing is sealed tight.


70  
Get us out of here, Dad!

40  40
Don't you want to be
the first one to see him?


0  70
Sure, I just don't want to be the last.

Are you going to help me or not?


0  70
Okay, with all our might, heave.

Hey, that's my summoner.

9
  
Silence, foolish peasant.

40

The summoner is mine.


40  30
Now, we shall rule again.

She's crazy.

Destroy them, my brother.

There can be no witnesses.

No!

You were weak.

I was strong.

I was the one who ruled.

Do you remember, my brother?

I remember!

No!

My life.

My life.

I lived inside this stone
every night for 4,000 years.

And now, I will never...

Is it...

Dead?

I guess not.

Stay here.

No!

Stop!

Hold him!

Hold him!

Haru!

Hara!

Do something!

Haru!

Haru!

Haru!

Sari!

Don't forget this.

You keep it.

Something to remember me by.

Old Egyptian custom.

When you get a lousy
gift, you're stuck with it.

Excuse me, just one minute.

I'll be right with you.

Okay, so what do I tell
these reporters out here?

The truth?

Sure.

1
  0
Tell them the mummy walked.


  0
And his sister's a 4,000-year-old beetle.

3
  0
And they almost got together
and ruled Egypt again.

4
0  740
You're right.


40  40
Nothing but the truth.


0  0
It's too bad you can't stay.

7

I wish I could.

But I'm looking forward to getting
back where the dead stay off their feet.

world of shopping malls.


  
Wow.

9
00  00
I'll tell you one thing.

93
  
When I get to the airport,


  0
I'm not buying any more summoners.

9
0  10
Can I give you a hand?

9
40  1
No, I got it.


0  0
I call it Home Sweet Home.
I'm interviewing in the city art show.


0  1
Sarah, that's just beautiful.
It belongs in a museum. Nice work.


10  90
She showed us the exact same
picture on the last family night.


0  4,
Amy, wait your turn.


  300
This week, I thought it would be nice
to show a movie I made all about us.

There's mom sticking to her diet again.

And dad's getting his hair just right.

Here's how come Sarah
hogs the bathroom so much.

Jack, you're such a pain.

Guess whose new sweater Amy's trying.


0  0
You little geek.


0  
Amy, where's your sense of humor?

3
30  0
Yeah, I could win a fortune on
that fractured family video show.

4
  00
How many times do I have to
tell you not to try on my clothes?

1
  
That's not very nice.
Next time, ask to use the camera.

1
  00
Sorry. Now can I have my turn?

So, Dennis, how was your family picnic?
Were you bothered by any ants?

No, worse. Termites.
You've heard of the Terminator.

Well, we had to call it the X-Terminator.

That's the best part.

This is so embarrassing.
You suddenly need a new one.

So I did.
Why don't you look behind the couch?

Really? You really got me a new dummy?

Well, almost new.

I was passing the second-hand
store near my office.

There he was, just sitting in the window.

Oh, wow, he's great.

Slappy? Daddy, thank you.

Karu, Mary, Donna, Loma, Malinu, Karinu?

Sounds like a foreign
language or something.

It probably means, it takes
a dummy to want a dummy.

You and I are going to make a great team.
I just know it.

It's nice to meet you, Slappy.
It's nice to meet you, too, Amy.

It must be great to have a new home.

You got that right, too. Amy!

Amy, if I catch you in my
room again, you're toast. Got it?

I was just trying it on.
I didn't hurt your dumb sweater.

Well, just stay out. Now go to bed.

Don't have to. Yeah, we don't have to.

Come on. Mom says so.

That's weird.

Look, Dennis, here's
your new friend, Slappy.


  00
Good night, Slappy. Good night, Dennis.


00  
Dennis.

4
00  00
Hi, Dennis.

4
  0
Sarah, what is it? It's ruined. Just look.


0  00
It's totally destroyed.

4
0  0
Oh, wow. What'd you do that for?


00  
I didn't do it.
I found this out in the hall.

0
00  
How could you?
You're always jealous of my art.

1
  00
I didn't. Why would I?
So who did? The Tooth Fairy?


  00
Pretty dumb, Amy.
Even I wouldn't try and get away with that.

3
  
Jed, stay out of it.


  
We'll talk about this later.
Now go get dressed.


00  
I'm always waiting for
everything around here.


03  
Amy, you'll miss your bus. Coming.

7
  04
Sorry you had to end up with
such a bizarre family, Slappy.


0,  
Ew. Red paint?

What's going on?

How did this get here?

If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hand.

If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands.

If you're happy and you know it
and you really want to show it...

If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands.

Hey, thank you, thank you,
thank you, ladies and germs.

And now I'd like to turn
the family night stage

over to Amy Kramer
and her little pal Slappy.

Take it away, Amy.

Hey there, family.

Nice to see you.

So Slappy, how do you like being
part of the Kramer family so far?

7
0  00
It's fantastic, but then my
last family was a pine tree.

73
00  0
So what did you think of Dad's song?

74
00  0
That was your dad?

7
0  0740
Well, what a relief.

7
  0730
I thought the cat got
stuck in the dishwasher.

77
  0740
Amy, that's not very nice.

7
0740  0730
Slappy.

79
0740  
And how about that mother of yours?

0
07  
She went to a store and
asked a clerk if he had anything

1
1  1
her size, and you told her
to try the freight elevator.


01  00
Amy?

3
  
But it's not me, it's him.

4
00  00
All right, the dummy made me do it.


01  00
I wouldn't laugh.


01  09
You're such a booger brain, you tried to
grow an eggplant by burying a chicken.

7
  
Hey, cut it out.


  00
I can't cut it out.

9
  00
You call yourself an artist?

90
000  0
Why don't you give up
brushes and try using a roller?


0  
Is this an art class?

9
071  
No, I can't stop him.

93
00  70
Help me get him off.


71  
Hey, take it easy on the stretch.


  
No, I can't.


03  
Hey, what's gotten into you?


00  
Okay, it's going on.


00  04
I'm not saying those things.


0  04
Okay.


04  04
Slappy is.

1
04  00
Okay, young lady, that's enough.


04  04
Up to bed, and take the dummy with you.

3
00  00
What are you?

4
0  
Talk to me.


0  40
Maybe I am crazy, but not crazy
enough to let you do the talking for me.


0  000
Wow, this poster's turning out great.

7
  0
So, you think Shane's going
to ask you to the dance?


00  0740
I wish.

9
  0
Then I can always go with Tyler.

0
09  04
Alicia, what have you got there?

1
  40
Dolls.


  
I found them.

3
03  
Sorry, she's such a snoop.

4
0  
That's okay, it's not like I
play with them anymore.


00  0
How come I always get stuck
babysitting and Tina never has to?


00  07
It's because you're in the middle.

7
03  04
The oldest one gets to
do whatever they want.


  01
The youngest gets away with everything.

9
40  
It's like a rule or something.

10
00  04
Sometimes I wish I didn't
have any brothers or sisters.


04  00
Yeah, tell me about it.

1
0  000
Amy, you're in big trouble.

1
00  0
Who said you could go into
my room and steal my markers?


00  00
I didn't steal them.

1
  
You're just borrowing them.

1
0  0
Well, you're using them up.


0  0930
You never even asked.

1
0930  0970
I told you to stay out of my room.


09  090
Just stay out of my life.

0
0,0  
Hi, Slappy.

1
00  
My name's Alicia.


  
Alicia, don't touch that.

3
  
She won't hurt it.

4
0,00  
He said he couldn't breathe in there.


00  00
Hey, Margo, you can forget about Shane.


00  00
He thinks you've got a
face like a can of worms.

7
00  
Amy, stop it.


  00
I didn't say it, he did.

9
70  
He's funny.

0
00  00
Ow!

1
  00
Hey, he won't let me go.


  00
Amy, let it out.

3
000  0
Stop it.

4
  03
Let her go.


00  00
Let me go.


00  00
Help me.

7
03  00
Let me go right now.


03  03
Help me.

9
  
Let me go right now.

10
04  00
Make him stop.


04  
Make him stop.

1
  00
Amy, what are you doing?


00  00
I'm not doing anything.

1
  00
Stop it.

1
00  00
Let her go.

1
  0
What in the world?


0  00
Uh-oh.

1
00  40
Are you all right?


0  0
Stay away from her.

10
0  90
What is going on up here?


40  30
Slappy grabbed Alicia
and he wouldn't let go.

1
0  0
What?


0  0
You're such a liar.


0  0
A big fat liar.

1
40  90
I don't ever want to see you again.

1
00  4,00
Not ever.


4,  
Margo, it wasn't me.

1
0  0
Amy, this has gone far enough.


40  103
But... You are staying in your
room until your father gets home.

0
100  ,
I don't want to hear another
word about that dummy.

1
40  
This can't be happening.


  740
Amy, this isn't funny.

3
  10
You can't keep blaming a doll for things
you don't want to take responsibility for.

4
0  00
Slappy's not a doll.


40  0
He's a dummy.


1  
I can't help it if he's
haunted or something.

7
100  1
Why won't anybody believe me?


30  0
Amy, this is just getting too weird.

9
0  40
Weird with a capital W.

10
40  
Come on now, you two.


  30
We're here to help Amy
as a family, not to criticize.

1
  40
Look, I know it's hard to believe.


0  0
But there's something going on.


0  40
Something I can't explain.

1
0  70
Yeah, right.

1
930  
Pumpkin, when I was
your age, I had two older


30  10
brothers and a baby
sister to deal with.

1
10  40
I know what it feels like
to be caught in the middle.


0  10
Nobody's listening to me.

0
10  0
It's all Slappy's fault.

1
0  10
Amy, if you really and truly believe
that Slappy is responsible for all this,


70  3
then maybe we need to get some help.

3
30  0
You mean like a doctor or something?

4
00  0
Like a total head shrinker.


0  00
Sarah!


0  70
I'm not making this up!

7
0  770
Can I watch TV now?


10  10
What?

9
0  0
Amy!


0  90
Oh, Amy, how could you?

01
0  0
He was gonna hit Dad! I had to stop him!

0
00  
Who was? What are you talking about?


1  7
Amy.

4
  
I didn't do it! He did!


1  
Okay, this stops here and now.


4  7
But, but... No buts, young lady.

7
3  3
I want you back upstairs and in bed now.


1  7
We'll discuss this in the morning.

9
  3
Way to go, Amy.

1
99  9
Oh, be quiet. I never did anything.


9  4
Jed, Sarah, get ready for school.

1
  9
I am ready.


9  3
They want to talk to Amy alone.


1  1
Amy, your mother and
I have talked about this.

1
1  1
And we want you to tell us
what you think we should do.

1
1  
You mean like a punishment?


  
I think we both know that's not the answer.

1
  4
This is about a lot more than
wrecking your father's guitar.


  
Amy, we want to help, but we
can't begin to understand what's


1  4
happening here if you keep
blaming Slappy for everything.

1
  3
I'm telling the truth.


4  4
I'm late for an open house.


4  7
When you're ready to tell us what's
really bothering you, then we'll talk.

4
  
Is that clear?


  
This is going to be a really cool dance.


  
Yeah.

7
  4
Let's put up a few more signs here
and then let's go down to the next block.


  4
It's going to be the best dance ever.

9
  
Hey, Margo.


79  3
You're never going to hurt me again.

1
  
Not ever.


4  
Hey, kid. Wait, wait, wait. Come on.

3
4  4
So why'd you do it?

4
  
Really?


1  1
Do what?


1  1
Wreck Dad's guitar.

7
  1
You knew you couldn't get away with it.


  1
There's no point in me telling you the
truth because you think I'm crazy anyways.

9
9  7
Well, tell Dad to wipe his stupid feet.

4
4  
Guess who?


1  7
Keep away from me.

4
9  
We're partners, Amy. Remember?


  
It wasn't very nice of you to
dump me in the sewer like that.


  
What do you want?

4
3  3
Don't you get it yet?
You can't get rid of me.

4
  4
What are you talking about?


  
Don't you remember, Amy?
You spoke the words.

4
4  7
Caru mariu danaloma.


  
Molinu carinum?


  4
You and I are one now.

1
  
Inseparable.


  
You are my slave.

3
3  77
No, I'm not going to be your slave.
You can't make me.


,  
I can make you do anything I want.


  
You have no choice.


9  73
Your whole family thinks you're crazy.

7
7  7
I've seen to that.


1  1
We'll lock you up.

9
4  1
Maybe they'll let you
see them on visiting days.


  
No!

1
99  1
Amy, I can hurt you and
your family in a hundred ways.


  
No, I won't let you.

3
1  ,
Amy.

4
9  9
Sarah.


3  3
Sarah, please.


1  
Hey, Sarah.

7
7  7
Wanna play?


  3
Hey, what's going on?

9
  
Run, but you cannot hide.

7
1  
What are we going to do?

71
  
I can't believe it.

7
  
Amy, I told you.

73
  
No one will believe me.

74
9  7
No, I'm sorry. I believe you now.

7
  
I think he's gone.

7
  7
Jed!

77
4  
Jed?

7
  1
Jed, are you okay?

79
  
Jed?


  7
Yoo-hoo! Looking for somebody?

1
7  
I've seen better swings on playgrounds.


77  7
Where is he?

3
3  73
Where'd he go?

4
4  
Amy!


  
From now on, this family belongs to me.


4  1
You're mine, Amy. You're mine.

7
4  4
What was that?


4  4
What's going on here?

9
  4
Hey, maybe Sally's the truth.

9
  4
Sally was after us and
then he turned on the lights.


  9
But Jed saved us.

9
  
What? Slow down.

93
  3
Yeah.


  ,
What's going on?

9
  1
What'd I do?

9
7  
If you didn't do it, then who?

97
  
It's good to be back in the family again.

I'd like to meet the guy who
said dogs are a man's best friend.

Get away. Leave me alone, you dumb dogs.

This isn't the first time
this has happened either.

Every time these
mutts see me, they start

chasing me like I have
a pocket full of liver.

It's humiliating.


  
Hear me wheezing?


  
It's because I have these stupid allergies.

The doctor said no running.

It's easy for him to say.

He doesn't have a pack of slobbering
hounds running after him all the time.

I hope no one saw me.

I must look like a real jerk.

Well, I guess I should
look at the bright side.

Dogs can't climb trees.

Ha ha. Try and get me now.

So much for the bright side.

Lily and I are in a rock band
with our friends Jared and Benny.

We practice in the
garage of an empty house.

It seems like there's a lot of empty
houses in our neighborhood lately.

The Duncans used to live here.

They moved out so fast they didn't
even bother to shut off the electricity.

Believe me, if the Duncans
would have heard our

band, they would have
moved out even faster.

Jared!

Keyboard solo!

Jared!

Jared!

Jared!

Jared!

What?

The song's over.

Oh. Hey, didn't we sound great?

We sound terrible.

What do you mean?
Didn't you hear my keyboard solo?

That was the problem. We did.

We were pretty bad.

And we had an audition coming
up next week for our first gig.

It's some kid's birthday party.

But then something
happened, which made dogs,

allergies, and lousy bands
seem like small potatoes.

Hey, check this out. Instant 10.
Gives you an instant 10.

Hey, cool. I'm gonna try some.

Me too.

Cool.
We'll all be bronze gods for the audition.

We can say we played a concert in Hawaii.

You guys are stupid. You don't
even know where that stuff came from.

Hairy Larry. King of the wimps.

Don't call me that.

Which one?
Hairy Larry or King of the wimps?

With your blonde hair
and a tan, you'd look great.

You think?

7
  0
Definitely.


00  
All right.

Hey, look at this. This stuff's old.
It says, caution, do not use after .

You've been running
again, haven't you, Larry?


00  00
That didn't hurt, did it?

Not at all.

3
000  09
Why did he need another injection so soon?
It wasn't due until next week.

4
0  0
Well, you see, if he gets too overheated,
it tends to aggravate his allergies.


00  0
You mean it's getting worse?


00  0
No need to panic yet.
Let's just wait and see.

7
  
In the meantime, you try
to slow down a bit, fella.


00  90
Boy, Jasper, I think it was that
instant tan that made me feel sick.

9
790  
But I can't tell Mom and Dad.

90
  000
They'd kill me if they knew I was
using some old stuff I found in a garage.

9
0930  00
Stupid tanning lotion.

9

I actually think I'm getting whiter.

93

What's your problem?


00  07
What have I done to myself?

Larry, are you all right in there?


00  04
I'm fine. No problem.


  
Well, then get to bed.
The doctor says you should rest.

Mom, do we have any hair remover?


  
Hair remover?

Never mind.

Sure.

Hey, Lily.

Where you rubbed that instant tan on?


  
I mean, like involving hair?

Hair? What do you mean?

I mean hair, you know, like
where you don't expect to see it.

No, are you?

Growing hair in weird places. Never mind.

30
  
Hairy Larry.
Hair on his head, hair on his mind.

3
00  00
Always worried about how he looks.

3
  000
Don't call me Hairy Larry. I hate that.


000  00
Don't get all sensitive. I was just joking.


00  
It was pretty embarrassing
talking to a girl about body hair.

3
00  04,
Even if she was my best friend.

3
0  00
Maybe I could tell Manny.


00  0
That instant tan stuff.

3
0  00
Maybe he was having the same problem.


  
Sitting here ringing this
thing doesn't even work.

40
  00
Manny?

4
  0
This is strange.

4
  00
It looks like they moved.


  
Did he say anything to you?


  
No, but you know Manny.

4
  
Manny?

4
00  00
Anyone?


00  
Larry, come here.

4
0730  0770
That's weird.


  00
I wonder if his clothes are still here.

0
  
Can I help you?


  04,
We were looking for Manny.


  
Manny who?

3
00  
Manny Hernandez. He lives here.


00  
Not anymore.


  00
This place is for sale.


  
And I'm the one who's selling it.

7
  00
Now run along.


0  
Unless of course you've got
enough money for a down payment.

9
  
Then you can hang out all you like.

0
  00
No?


00  04
Then get out of here.


00  00
Later at Lily's house,

3
  00
we talked about Manny's
strange disappearance.

4
0  0
Well, I don't know about strange.


00  
Maybe Manny's father was transferred.


  
Pass the corn there.

7
00  0
You think he'd say goodbye.


  
That's why we leave all his stuff.

9
09  09
Oh, thank you.

70
0970  0930
We had an audition
coming up and everything.

7
  
Well, you know Manny.

7
00  0970
Pass that tuna loaf please, Larry.

73
0  
Oh, is the dish too hot?

74
00  00
Did you burn yourself?

7
  
Let me see that hand.

7
00  00
I'm fine.

77
00  0990
Whoa.

7
0  0
Corn worms.

79
  
Deadly.

0
  00
Fresh piece.


04,  00
Where's the bathroom?


  00
Are you okay, Larry?

3
00  00
I'm fine.

4
04  04
I told you.


00  
Tuna loaf's no good after the third day.


0  04,
Oh.

7
0  00
Doesn't anybody shave in this house?


  
Larry?

9
0  ,0
What's wrong?

90
0  90
I'm fine. I'll be right there.

9
  
Yeah, I was fine all right.

9
70  0
If you don't mind having arms like Bigfoot.

93
730  0
I decided I better get out of here.


90  90
Any way I could.

9
0  ,
But guess what?

9
40  70
Stupid dogs again.

97
7  0
I couldn't believe it.

9
70  
Larry, what are you doing in there?

99
3  ,
Uh.


30  0
Be right there.

0
0  3
What's for dessert?

0
0  0
Dessert?

03
0  40
Was that lame or what?

04
0  0
We have a nice tapioca.

0
400  40
Where's the mint ice cream?

0
40  0
Here were my choices.

07
4  40
Total embarrassment
or a pack of savage dogs.

0
40  40
Larry, if this is about the car,

09
0  00
don't worry.

0
0  30
We've got plenty more.


  ,00
And tapioca.


  
I hate tapioca.


  
I couldn't face the embarrassment
of the tapioca, so I jumped.

4
,  0
The dogs took off
after me, but I lost them.


0  0
Then I raced home.


740  00
I had to check and see if there
was hair growing anywhere else.

7
0  
None on my chest.


40  40
None on my back.

9
4,00  
And now my legs.

0
0  0
Sorry to get you out of bed, Lyle.


70  70
No problem at all.


90  40
I knew I should have told you about the
instant tan the first time I saw the hair.


30  30
I was stupid.

4
90  0
I never should have put it on.


0  9
I don't think the tanning
lotion had anything to do with it.


40  40
Really?

7
0  30
That's unlikely.


0  0
If tanning lotion could grow hair,
we'd have a cure for baldness.

9
00  730
So what is causing it?

0
30  0
Oh, it's probably some sort.


0  970
of skin irritation.


30  30
It'll be gone before you know it.

3
970  970
Could it be nerves, Doc?

4
90  0
Yes.


0  0
Larry has a band audition coming up.


,00  0
Yes. Yes.

7
3  0
Yes, that's probably it.


40  0
Everything's under stress.

9
4  
I guess you just have to take
it a little easier. Right, Larry?

40
40  40
I guess so.

4
90  90
Thanks, Doc.

4
0  0
Anytime.


770  0
There was something weird about the
way my parents and the doctor were acting.


  3
All I could hope was that the
hair would be gone by morning.

4
40  40
Hi, Jasper.

4
0  00
Don't scare me like that.


00  40
Not again.

4
40  30
Go away. Get.


00  300
Get away. Go.

0
0  300
Wait a minute.


40  40
Come here.


400  4,00
Come here, girl.

3
0  0
Come here.


0  0
That's just like Lily's.


90  0
Those eyes.


0  0
Lily?

7
30  0
Come here.


90  40
Come here, girl. Come back.

9
0  0
Hi, Mrs. Turnbull.

0
4  4
Going on a trip?


40  0
Is Lily here?


0  40
You must have the wrong house.

3
4,  0
There's no one here named Lily.

4
00  0
But Lily lives here.


00  ,
Listen to what I'm telling you.


  ,
There is no Lily.

7
0  10
Forget about her.


40  0
You'd better go.

9
90  701
But Lily is... Go.

70
  
Go.

71
  1
Mom, Dad,

7
100  1
something weird's happening.

I saw Lily.

I think she's a dog.

Oh, hi, Larry.

Didn't you hear me?

What is it?

You're not listening.

I saw this dog. It had eyes just like Lily.

And it was wearing Lily's gold coin.

That's silly.


740  0
Gold coins are not uncommon.

3
0  40
And lots of dogs have
different colored eyes.

4
4,  
No, it's too weird.


0  0
Her parents, they wouldn't even
admit they knew anyone named Lily.


0  40
That's ridiculous.

7
40  ,0
You must have misunderstood.


0  0
I didn't misunderstand anything.

9
0  10
Larry.

90
10  40
I know what I heard. I know what I saw.


1  40
It's that instant tan. It has to be.

9
  40
How about some roast beef?

93
00  0
I don't want food. I want answers.


0  40
Larry, don't run.

9
  ,0
Watch out for cars.

9
0  0
I couldn't believe it.

97
0  740
I felt like I was going crazy.

9
0  0
What were my mom and dad hiding?

99
0  0
Could Lily really be a dog?


0  1
I felt so mixed up.

301
1  10
I wanted Lily back and Manny.

30
10  10
I felt so alone.

303
40  40
It didn't make any
sense, but I kept thinking

304
  ,
it had something to
do with that instant tan.

30
0  0
I wasn't sure exactly what.

30
10  0
I put that stuff on my face.

307
10  40
Maybe it was seeping through
my pores, affecting my brain.

30
30  0
I went to the garage
where our band practiced.

309
4,  0
I wanted to talk to Jared.

3
  0
Maybe he could help me find that lotion.

3
740  740
Get it tested.


0  0
Figure some way out of this mess.

3
70  10
It's about time.

3
10  0
I was so freaked out I'd
forgotten about the audition.


0  
And that's when I saw the dog.


  4,
Jared?

3
00  70
It sounded like him.


0  90
Could it be?

3
30  10
Suddenly the little kid ran to his father
like he was scared of me or something.

30
40  0
Then I saw why.


1  40
The hair. It was back.

3
10  10
What's wrong?


  0
What's happening to me?


0  0
Mom! Dad!

3
0  0
Come on in here, Larry.

3
10  0
We're sorry, Larry.


9  30
We really wanted it to work out.

3
30  30
Want a cookie?


90  0
Hello!

0
  0
Get a clue? How about a steak?

3
740  0
Mr.
Merkin said his appetite might be affected.


4  0
Poor Larry. He's had a hard day.

3
1  1
Yummy, yummy.

4
0  0
I guess it's better than nothing.


70  0
Attaboy!


90  
Now this seems familiar.

7
0  30
Well, Mom and Dad, the Boyds,
explained to me what happened.


0  0
Excuse me. I like to snack.

9
30  0
Hey, guys!

0
0  0
Mr. and Mrs. Boyd came here
to be part of Dr. Merkin's project.

1
0  100
He learned how to turn dogs into humans.


10  0
That's why I got those
shots every two weeks.

3
0  0
But I'm back to my old self now.

4
90  40
Lily, Manny, and Jared
come over all the time.


40  40
We have fun. Chasing cars, barking
at strangers, scratching in public.


0  
All the cool stuff you don't
get to do when you're human.

7
0  40
Uh-oh. I know that car.


0  0
It's Dr. Merkin.

9
740  0
What's he doing here?

30
1  
What's he doing here?


0  0
It's okay, Larry.
Dr. Merkin isn't here to see you.

3
40  
That's right. I'm through with dogs.


  0
Oh, look. She's smiling.

3
0  10
What a good little girl.

3
  0
Yes, you are. You're a good little girl.

3
30  0
Welcome to your new home, Jasper.


0  0
Jasper? The cat? My Jasper?

3
40  40
Come on in.


0  0
Here we go again.


00  
I wish you weren't going.


40  
So do I. But your Aunt Eleanor's
sick, honey. She needs me.


00  0
I know, but... I'll be
back as soon as I can.


0  ,
I know. It's just that I'm worried about
Dad. He's been acting so weird lately.


0  1
He's under a lot of pressure, Margaret.


0  10
But he never has time for me anymore.
He's even stopped calling me princess.

I thought you hated that.

I do. But it just seems like he's changed.

I bought a card for Aunt Eleanor.

That's very thoughtful of you, sweetheart.

Come here.

Dad's always down in the
basement, ever since he lost his job.

What does he do down there anyway?

He's a botanist. He studies plants.

I know that. But all the time?

He wants to prove to the university that
they made a mistake when they let him go.

You know, it's never
really fun to be fired.

I know all that. I just think
something's wrong. Something else.

Like what?

I don't know.

Don't give him a chance, Margaret.
It's a tough time for him.

Everything's going to be fine.

I'm counting on you two to
take good care of your father.

4
00  
Now go get your dad.
I don't want to be late for my plane.

I love you.

I love you too.
Say hi to Aunt Eleanor for me.

I will.

Bye, Mom.

Bye-bye, sweetheart.

And, Mom, don't worry.
I'll take good care of Dad.

Oh, Margaret, I left Aunt Eleanor's
number next to the phone in the kitchen.

Okay, bye, Mom.

Bye.

Dad?

You never hear stuff when he's working.

Dad?

Dad?

Stay out of the basement!

We're sorry, but Mom said to get
you because she didn't want to be late.

Look, kids, I'm sorry I raised my voice.

I just don't want you down in the basement.

Okay? Now, come on. Walk me outside. Okay?

Okay, now, kids, don't forget
what I said about the basement.


  0
Why is he so freaked about the basement?

4
00  
Because he doesn't want
us messing with his work.

4
  03
What was that?


00  
Hey!

4
  
Just listen.


0  
Did you hear it?


14  1
Maybe it's the wind.

1
  
That's not the wind.


9  
Sounds like it's coming from the basement.

3
  
Sounds like an animal.


4  3
Like it's hurt or something.


3  
We have to go down there.


  3
But Dad said that.

7
3  
I know what Dad said, but what
happens if there is an animal?


  
And it's like a stray cat or
something, and it's suffering.

9
  4
We have to go down here.


  
We?

1
  4
We'll just take a little peek.


  4
Make sure nothing's wrong.

3
  
It's so hot in here. How can that stand it?

4
  4
Shh.


  
Do you hear it?


  
I'm not sure.

7
  ,
Whoa.


1  4
It's like a jungle.

9
1  1
I can hardly breathe.

7
4  
Listen, it sounds like
the plants are breathing.

71
3  
I wonder if Dad's doing the rainforest.

7
4  
I'm studying it in school.

73
7  49
Casey, let's get out of here.

What are you doing?

That plant just grabbed me.

Come on, plants don't grab people.

What happened to your finger?

I pricked it on one of the thorns.

My sweater! It's in the basement.

Casey!

I've got to get it.
Dad will know we've been down there.

Casey, come on. Hurry up.

Hurry!

Casey, come on. Move it!

Casey!

Hurry!

7
  00
Come on, Casey. What are you doing?


  
Hurry!

9
3  3
Casey!

9
77  7
Did Mom make her plane?


1  1
Yes.

9
  
Are you in the basement?

93
4  
We heard some noises.


9  
Like someone was crying.


  
Did you go into the basement?


  
We were scared. The noises were strange.


  3
Did you go into the basement?


4  4
Yes.


  4
We didn't touch anything.


,0  00
I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry.

1
00  00
The kid's okay?


00  0
Yeah. We're fine.

3
  
Okay. Come.

4
0  0
Okay, have a seat.


00  
Now, if I explained to you what I'm doing
in the basement, would you feel better?


  90
I would.

7
40  01
Okay. Now, I'm going to try to
explain this to you as simply as possible.


01  70
Botanists often try to take good qualities
from some plants and put them into another.

9
  00
And that's what you're doing?

0
0  03
No, no, no. I'm doing something
a little bit more unusual.

1
  
I can't tell you what it is right now.
Okay?


03  00
Okay. Maybe you can tell us later.

3
  0
Yeah, well, maybe.

4
00  04
Hey, Mom rented us movies.
I could make some popcorn


0  00
and we could stay up
late and watch them all.


00  00
No, no, no. I have a lot of work to do.
Maybe some other time.

7
  
Something's not right.


0990  
We shouldn't have gone down there.

9
00  00
Yum.

10
03  00
Don't you dare. That's for Dad.
There's some more in the pan.


  0
Dad, breakfast is ready.

1
0930  00
Dad? Breakfast.

1
0  0
Yes!


40  
You want to go outside and play catch?

1
70  0
You know how Dad is when he's working?

1
1  1
Yeah, weird.


1  10
He's not weird. It's just that his work is
more important than breakfast, that's all.

1
40  
He'll eat it when he's ready.
See? I told you.


30  
Well, I'm going outside to play.

0
  
Dad.

1
  4,
I made you some breakfast.


0  0
I'm not hungry.

3
90  
Mom, I saw him. He was eating it.

4
0  0
I'm sure it has something
to do with his work.


10  0
But the way he looked.


70  40
He always gets wrapped
up in his experiments.

7
0  0
Don't worry.


100  100
How's Casey?

9
70  0
He's okay. He's out in the yard playing.

0
0  0
Mom, when are you coming home?

1
10  0
Aunt Eleanor's just recovering
from her surgery. She still needs me.


0  40
Mom, I can't explain it, but I've just
got this really bad feeling about Dad.

3
  40
Hi, honey. Everything okay?

4
70  740
Oh, that's a shame.


0  
Margaret? Yes.


,00  0
You're right.
I should spend more time with her.

7
0  1
Absolutely, you're right.


40  0
We miss you.

9
0  0
I will.

10
0  0
Bye.


  0
I hope Aunt Eleanor starts feeling better.

1
0  0
Bye.


10  0
Margaret?

1
930  930
What are you doing?

1
4,00  00
Shh.

1
0  0
I'm scared, Casey.
I saw something last night.


1  0
Dad cut his arm, and this
green stuff was oozing out of it.

1
0  70
You're nuts.


0  10
And he was talking to himself, and
he had leaves growing out of his head.

10
0  10
Cut it out.


  
I'm not kidding, Casey.
You want to know what I think?

1
0  0
Know what?


0  0
I think Dad's a mad scientist.


0  0
Margaret! Casey! Come here, kids!

1
0  0
Hey.

1
0  40
Have a seat. It's almost ready.


40  0
Coming right up, two of Dad's specials.

1
10  0
Hey, Dad, what's with the cat?
I thought you hated baseball.


1  0
So I guess you kids think that your
old dad's acting pretty darn weird, huh?

0
00  0
There's something wrong, Margaret?

1
10  10
Something bothering you?


  ,
Come on, talk to me.

3
90  0
I saw you last night.

4
90  90
In the bathroom.


10  0
Spying on me?


40  10
No. I mean that... No. You're
just... concerned about me.

7
40  40
Right?


7  
Dad, why are leaves
growing out of your head?

9
40  90
Well, that's... just a side effect.

10
0  0
It's only temporary.


1  10
It'll go away soon, and my hair will
grow back. That's why I'm wearing this cap.

1
  10
Why was the green stuff
coming out of your cut?


70  4,
Well, that wasn't coming out of my cut.


00  30
That was fluid that comes from the leaves.

1
730  00
Now, I'm working on something.

1
70  40
And it's very, very unusual.


10  10
I'm trying to build a
plant that is part animal.

1
40  
You mean you're taking animal
cells and putting them in a plant?


30  90
I can't say any more.

0
0  0
How about some breakfast?

1
0  10
Eat.


  
What is it?

3
0  970
It's my special recipe. Go ahead. Dig in.

4
40  90
It doesn't smell so good.


40  70
It'll taste just fine.


90  1
What's the matter with you two?
Pick up your spoons and eat it!

7
00  
When I get back, I expect
those bowls to be empty.


0  0
Dr. Merrick, what are you doing here?

9
1  1
Watch for Dad.


0  0
Well, as I said a few weeks ago, I've
come by to check on how you work...

01
0  0
Dad, hurry!

0
10  0
You know, I've always
supported your work. It

03
0  40
wasn't my idea to let you
go. The board forced me.

04
70  4,
But I'm not giving up yet.

70  30
So, now let's see what kind
of progress you've made.

0
  
Oh, hi guys. How are you?

07
0  
Have you finished your breakfast?

0
4  0
Yeah, it was pretty good.

09
  0
Look, I'll just be down there, okay?


0  0
Um...


1  0
I want you kids to go outside and play.

1
100  
I don't believe anything Dad says anymore.


0  70
At least Dad told us about his experiments.


  0
Yeah, but what about that gross
junk he tried to make us eat?

1
10  10
Good one!

1
4,00  10
Dr. Merrick, if you would have asked
me when I brought in my numbers,


00  10
they were good numbers.

1
40  10
They were very, very good numbers.


10  10
What number are you talking about?

0
1  0
Casey!

1
0  10
I was always trying to
make a case, Dr. Merrick.


00  0
All by myself.


1  0
I can't believe it!

4
  00
You're insane!


  
No!


10  0
No!


,  0
I'll be back as soon as I can.


00  
I know, it's just that I'm worried about
Dad. He's been acting so weird lately.


0  00
He's under a lot of pressure, Margaret.


00  0
But he never has time for me anymore.


40  10
He's even stopped calling me princess.


0  10
Look, kids, I'm sorry I raised my voice.
I just don't want you down in the basement.


1  1
Do you hear it?


  
I'm not sure.


0  90
Whoa, it's like a jungle.


3  3
What are you doing?


970  0
That plant just grabbed me.

1
0  0
I'm trying to build a
plant that is part animal.


0  0
So, now let's see what kind
of progress you've made.


90  0
Go ahead, eat.

1
  
Casey!

1
  
Listen.


  0
What are you doing?

1
01  0
Casey!


  
Get it off, Margaret!

0
30  
Real funny.

1
  
Help me, I'm caught!


0770  0
Casey!


00  
Margaret, come here, quick!
Please, Margaret, get it off!

4
00  
Casey!


  90
Get it off, get it off, get it off!


00  
Harder!

7
00  03
Get it off! Pull, pull, pull!


  
Hold still!

9
0  00
Get it off!

30
  00
You okay?


00  00
They were fighting.

3
04  00
Who?


00  00
I don't know, Dad, I guess,
and Dr. Merritt, in the basement.


000  000
Are you sure?

3
00  
I couldn't see, but I heard them.
Then that thing got me.

3
0  00
What are you doing?


90  0
That plant tried to choke me.

3
0  
You shouldn't have been near the window.


  
Well, Casey heard a fight in the basement.

40
0  
There was no fight.


0  0
But I heard it.

4
00  01
I'm telling you, there was no fight.


  
Where's Dr. Merritt?


  04,
Just left.

4
0  
I didn't see him leave.

4
0  01
Are you interrogating me, Margaret?


0  0
No.

4
00  
Now you tell me, what were you
doing next to the basement window?


03  
I was playing like you told me to.

0
0  00
Did you put him up to this, Margaret?

1
  00
Is this more of your spying?


04  0
We were playing.

3
09  
What about that plant?

4
099  099
It's part of my work.


0  0
The work that you've now disrupted.


00  00
You're not a mad scientist, are you, Dad?

7
0  00
No, I'm an angry scientist!


  0
Now, both of you, up to your rooms.

9
40  71
But we could have sworn we
heard a... Did you hear what I said?

0
00  01
Yeah, but... Go!

1
  00
What's that noise?


  
I put locks on the basement windows.

3
  0770
From the inside.

4
70  00
So don't try getting
in through there either.


  
Stop gawking at me.


0  
Dad?

7
  00
I'm going out for a little while.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.


0  0
I'm calling Mom.

9
0  03
I can't believe it. It
was a white piece of

70
0  00
paper with Aunt Eleanor's
phone number on it.

71
  03
It was sitting right here on the counter.

7
03  03
What do you think happened to it?

73
03  
I think Dad took it.
He didn't want us to call Mom.

74
  00
That's crazy.

7
01  
So, leaves growing out of your head
and green gunk coming out of your arm,

7
0  0
and also eating plant food
and trying to make us eat it,

77
0  04
and lying about Dr. Merrick.

7
00  03
Why do you think he's
lying about Dr. Merrick?

79
00  00
He said Dr. Merrick left.
Did you see him leave?

0
00  70
What are you saying?

1
970  
You think Dad's done
something to Dr. Merrick?


04  04
I don't know, Casey.

3
0  
What are you saying?

4
0  00
I'm saying it's possible.


  
No, it isn't. He's our Dad.


  
Where are you going?

7
  930
If Dad took the number,
it might be in his room.


  
You're going in his room?

9
01  00
You want to talk to Mom, don't you?

90
03  
Come on, let's get out of here.


0740  0740
Margaret.

9
07  07
What?

93
0740  074,00
Come on, let's go.


  0
Don't answer it.


00  00
Why not?

I don't know.

Well, it might be Mom.

Hi, you've reached the Brewer family.

At the tone, please leave a message.

We'll be sure to get back to you.

Hi, this is Gloria
Merrick, Dr. Merrick's wife.

I was wondering if my husband was there.

I'm a little worried.
He was supposed to be home hours ago.

If you hear from him or you know where he
is, could you please call me at 555-0101?

Thank you.

I don't like this, Casey.

I don't like it one bit.

Dad!

Hi, you've reached the Brewer family.

At the tone, please leave a message.

We'll be sure to get back to you.

He's coming! He's coming!

Hi, you've reached the Brewer family.

At the tone.

Hi, Dad.

What are you doing out of your room?

I, um, needed to go to the bathroom.

Where's Margaret?

She's in her room.

10
  
Did you go in my room?


00  00
No.

1
  00
Okay, I forgot something.

1
  00
Then go back out.


00  
I want you back in your room.

1
  
Is that clear?

1
70  0
Casey?


0  770
Yes, Dad?

1
,0  10
I'll be back in an hour.


30  90
Okay, Dad.

0
0  90
Stay in your room while I...

1
0  0
Yes, Dad.


70  970
You too, Margaret.

3
0  0
You were great.


0  10
He seemed so angry, Margaret.


0  
He had Dr. Merrill's wallet.


70  0
He dropped it and I saw it.

7
10  1
What are you looking at?


1  1
There's something under these covers.

9
0  10
What?

0
0  90
I have to get to the bottom of this.

1
0  0
I have to know the truth.


1  1
And I have a feeling the
truth is in the basement.

3
0  00
If there's anything
we can use to protect


0  0
ourselves, who knows
what those plants can do?


  
Look.


0  0
We kill her.

7
,  
Come on.


1  0
Help me.

9
0  70
What are these things?

10
930  0
Whatever they are, they
aren't exactly friendly.


0  0
Oh, gross.

1
0  0
I think I'm going to be sick.


0  0
Hey.


10  770
Isn't that the plant
that tried to grab you?

1
0  30
The plant you cut your finger on?

1
0  70
Someone's in there.


0  0
Or something.

1
00  0
This belongs to Dr. Merrick.


9  70
He could be in there.

10
90  0
Looks like just a bunch of normal plants.


,  
Then what were...

1
00  00
Sounds.


0  0
Dad?


0  0
It's Dad!

1
0  0
That's not Dad!

1
70  70
No, stop!


0  
Casey, let go of me!

1
10  0
What's wrong with you?


90  0
It's Dad!

0
  1
It can't be Dad!

1
1  1
Dad left, remember?


0  ,
I've got to untie him.

3
0  10
No, look at his head.


10  0
We already saw that.


1  0
Remember, it's a side effect.


10  10
No, don't.

7
1  1
Okay.


0  10
I won't untie him.

I'll just take the tape
off his mouth, okay?

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Oh, kids.

It's so good to see you.

Now, quick.

Untie me.

How did you get in there?

I thought you left.

No, that wasn't me.

I've been locked up
in that closet for days.

Huh?

But how?

We saw you.

No.

It wasn't me.

It's a plant.

It's a plant copy of me.

Wait.

Look, I have no time to explain.

Just untie me.

Quick.

You're saying the father
we've been living with is a plant?

Yes.

Just untie me.

How do we know you're telling the truth?

I'll explain later.

Okay?

I promise.

I'm untying him.

Oh, yes.

That's it.

That's it.

That's it.

What are you doing?

He's not our real father.

He is.

I know he is.

Aren't you?

Aren't you?

No, he's not.

I'm your real father.

He's not your dad.

He's not even human.

He's a plant.

You're the plant.

No.


10  40
He's lying.

7
  
He's a copy.


0  
He's a plant copy.

9
70  90
One of my experiments that went wrong.

0
0  
I put him in there because he's dangerous.

1
0  0
I'll spray him.


40  40
No.

3
0  0
He's the copy.

4
40  40
He's the dangerous one.


100  40
He's trying to make plant copies of us all.


0  0
Spray him.

7
10  0
I don't know what to do.


10  0
Give me that.

9
0  10
Get back, both of you.

40
  30
Margaret, listen to me.


  0
He'll destroy us all.

4
7  70
He had me locked up.


740  70
I escaped.


  
You're a liar.

4
0  70
He was the one that
tried to feed you the food.

4
4,  0
He attacked Merrick.


0  0
No, that's not true.

4
10  
He has Merrick locked
up in the other cupboard.


30  0
Don't listen to him.

0
0  1
Attack him.

1
0  0
Now.


10  0
Before it's too late.

3
,  1
Destroy him.

4
1  1
Please.


0  0
Princess.


0  0
Princess.

7
0  10
There's only one person
who calls me princess.


10  30
My real dad.

9
1  0
Because Saturday is
better at the university lab.

0
,00  
Oh, by the way, the board wants
to know when you can come back.

1
0  0
Full time.


10  0
Well, as soon as I get
over all these side effects.

3
0  0
Ah, listen.

4
970  77
I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.


  9
Oh, and I appreciate you
getting me out of that closet.


90  00
Well, I should thank
Margaret and Casey for that.

7
30  70
I still don't understand
how the whole thing started.


0  1
Well, it was an accident.

9
10  9
I cut my hand on a slide.

70
90  990
And some of my blood mixed
in with some plant molecules.

71
40  70
And I ended up with something
that was part plant and part human.

7
  90
You never told me any of this.

73
00  
Yeah, I know.

74
0  0
I should have.

7
90  0
But I was wrapped up in my work.

7
90  0
Then I went too far.

77
4  40
I created a plant that
was an exact copy of me.

7
0  0
Merrick said that it was evil.

79
  
Well, to us, yes.

0
1  30
But like most organisms, it
wanted to dominate its environment.

1
0  0
It overpowered me.


10  1
And I think that it wanted to
make plant copies of us all.

3
0  0
Oh, man!

4
30  40
You know, when Aunt Eleanor was
getting better, she asked me about you two.


0  930
I said you were both growing like weeds.


0  90
I never realized how close
to the truth I almost was.

7
30  70
Well, I'm just glad we're all okay.


0  0
And all human.

9
0  0
Listen, I'll call you tomorrow, Dr. Brewer.

90
0  70
Okay, thank you.


990  990
Okay.

9
90  90
Bye.

93
40  40
Listen, anybody for lunch?


0  40
I got a great mixed salad
and some garden vegetables.

9
  
No.

9
70  0
No, no, I'm only kidding.

97
90  30
I got hamburgers for everybody.

9
  0
Let's go.

99
0  90
Let's go.


0  0
I'll be right there.

301
0  0
Margaret.

30
,  1
Margaret, help me.

303
1  1
Please help me.

304
0  40
I'm your father.

30
40  0
I'm your real father.

30
1  ,
Real father.

307
0  010
Oh, I'm your father.

30
0  
No, I'm your father.

309
0  04,
I'm your father.

3
  000
I'm your father.

3
00  00
I'm your father.


01  01
No, I'm your father.

3
000  00
I'm your father.

3
  00
No, he is your father.


  
I'm your father.


  0
I'm your father.

3

I'm your father.


70  40
I'm your father.

I'm your father.

I'm your father.

I'm your father.

I'm your father.

I'm your father.

I'm your father.

I'm your father.

I'm your father.

I'm your father.

I'm your father.

Okay, everybody grab something.

I know what you mean, killer.
I didn't want to move here either.

Come on, sweetie.
You know we needed more room.

Come on, kid. Give it a chance.

Hey, Carlo.

Hey, come to help us unpack?

No, but I will.

Guess what? It only took me eight
minutes and forty-six seconds to get here.

Hey, see?
We're practically in the same neighborhood.

Come on, killer. Let's go.

When we moved into our new
house, everyone was happy.

Everyone but me, that is.


,00  0
Oh, killer.


0  0
I'll get him, mom.

1
0  0
Come here, killer.

1
90  00
I had a feeling something
bad was going to happen.


30  0
And guess what? I was right.

1
1  0
Killer?


40  0100
Killer, what's gotten into you?

0
  
Come on, outside.

1
00  00
Out you go. Good boy.


  00
Take my advice.


  40
When your dog whines and paws at something,
and you go to see what it is, be careful.

4
  00
Be very careful.


0770  0
Oh, it's a kitty.


  
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

7
00  00
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.


  
Come here.

Come here.

Kitty, what happened?

That thing, it's alive.

You were scared by a sponge?

Butt out, okay?

Killer was after it. He could tell.

It has eyes and everything.

It's just a basic sponge.

It must have been the light
reflecting on it or something.

My china.

Oh, no.

My mother gave me these dishes.

Get that dog out of here.

Come on, killer.

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

4
04  04
What happened?

4
00  00
It was an accident.


00  
I was washing my face, and I wanted
to reach for my towel, and it was there.

4
  
What was there?


  0,
That ugly sponge.

0
00  
I don't know how it got in
here, but it was staring at me.

1
  00
It was staring right at me.


01  00
Katrina, please, this isn't funny anymore.

3
0  04,
But I swear it was right there.

Please.

Now go find a broom
and clean up this glass.

And be careful not to cut yourself.

I need stitches, right?

Hardly.

Eat a proper breakfast.

But cold pizza's got all
the basic food groups on it.

And so does your face.

Go and get yourself some cereal.

Look out!

Paper towel with eyes.

Very funny.

Have you guys seen Killer this morning?

I thought he was in your room.

He was with me last night,
but he wasn't this morning.

Danny, you see him?

No.

I'm going to go take a ride
around later, see if I can find him.

It's not like him just
to run off like that.

Bad things were happening,
and they were getting worse.

First it was my mom's smashed dishes.

Then my brother's cut foot.

7
  0
Now my dog had disappeared.

77
00  000
I thought, what's next?

7
  00
My brain!

79
00  
This proved it.

0
00  
Something was definitely going on.

1
00  00
Scared?


  
Nah.

3
04  09
What happened?

4
0970  30
I trashed my bike.


00  
Wow.


  
Everything's going wrong.

7
  
Did Killer come home?


07  0790
Nope. Dad's checking the pound.

9
07  071
There's something weird going on here.

90
07  4
I have this creepy feeling
it's all tied in with that sponge.


70  9
Here she goes again.

9
0  00
Killer is sponge from Mars.

93
00  07
Hey, all I know is that
ever since we found


0  
that sponge, we've
had nothing but bad luck.


0  0
Ah!


00  
Get away from me!


03  00
See, see, what did I tell you, huh?


00  
This is better than the X-Files.


00  
What are you going to do with it?


0  00
I'm going to get rid
of it once and for all.

1
  0,0
What if it's a new species or something?


00  00
Then it's about to get stinked.

3
  
Yeah, this sponge is amazing.

4
0  00
It needs to be stinked.
No, it needs to be dead.


0  00
I'm asking you in the name
of science not to do this.


  
You're right. Forget science.

7
04,  000
You're a stupid sponge.


00  90
Say goodnight, spongy.

9
  
I...

1
0  
think our bad luck is about to change.

1
  
I was right about one thing.


0  00
Our luck was going to
change from bad to worse.

1
  00
You're going to catch a chill, kitty.

1
  04
Come on inside, it's bedtime.


  
Still no sign of Killer, huh?


00  00
No, but he'll turn up. I know he will.

7
00  
Everything's going to
be all right from now on.


0  00
Come on inside.

9
40  40
What happened?

10
03  03
Everything's dying.


  0
Cat, what happened?

1
04  04
What do you think?

1
40  0
What are we going to do with it now?


0  0
We need an expert.

1
00  30
I'm going to take it to school.

1
0  
Maybe Miss Vanderhoff
will know what to do with it.


0  0
Aha.

1
  1
Just as I suspected.

It's a sponge.

I know that.

But what kind of a sponge?

Garden variety natural
kitchen sponge by the look of it.

Well, this thing is weird.

It has eyes and everything.

Eyes?


70  70
Sponges don't have eyes.

7
0  90
Well, maybe it's not a sponge then.


0  40
I don't know. It moves around a lot.

9
30  790
All this bad stuff's been happening.

0
0  0
Look, can't you just check it out?

Dissect it or something?

Please?

Check back with me tomorrow after school.

Thanks, Miss Vanderhoff.


0  0
Oh, and Miss Vanderhoff.


0  
Just make sure that whatever you do, you
put it back in its cage when you're done.

7
40  40
Bye.


40  10
Things kept getting weirder.

9
0  10
And I mean weird.

Encyclopedia of the Weird.


10  10
Does it have her picture in it?

1
0  0
So what's the book say?


0  10
It says that your weirdo
sponge is actually a gruel.


10  10
A gruel?

1
0  
What's a gruel?

1
0  0
Theoretically, a gruel
is a mythical creature


077  990
believed to be a
living bad luck charm.

1
10  90
You mean it causes bad luck?


0  0
Exactly.

10
0  0
And then it feeds on
the bad luck it causes.


0  0
Each time something bad
happens, it gets stronger.

1
70  0
Well, that explains all the accidents.


,  0
Does it say how to kill it?


0  0
Nope.

1
1  
Do you really buy all this?

1
0  70
Straight from the book.


70  930
Just be glad you didn't find a lance.

1
0  
A what?


  4
A lance.

0
70  
It's this little vampire potato that
sucks the life force right out of you.

1
  70
It's got these mean little teeth.


770  3
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3
70  40
Let's just deal with one
monster at a time, all right?

4
90  930
Why don't we just mail it to the North
Pole or drop it in the ocean or something?


90  0
Not a good idea.


0  0
If the owner gives the
gruel away, the owner dies.

7
10  0
I must be the owner.


0  0
I'm the one that found it.

9
  
That's right.

10
07  
Lucky thing you dug it up from the garden.


10  0
Oh, but I left it with Miss
Vanderhoff at school.

1
0  0
You what?


4,00  00
Does that count?


10  90
I wouldn't wait around to find out.

1
930  0
We have to get it back.

1
0  0
Now.


  70
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.

1
  0
You make me happy once I'm afraid.


  
You'll never know, dear,
how much I love you.

0
0  70
Please don't take my sunshine away.

1
40  70
It's not here.


790  790
It's gotta be.

3
0  0
Okay, just stay calm.

4
  1
Everybody spread out and search.


10  0
You'll never know, dear,
how much I love you.


70  0
Please don't take my sunshine away.

7
0  790
It's Bubblegum.


70  70
Hi.

9
90  0
What's he doing?


40  0
Fixing the lights.

01
0  
Is he dead?

0
30  0
No, he's breathing.

03
  0
I know that sound.

04
  
We've gotta get help.

0
30  
You just stay with him, alright?

0
  40
I think it came from those shelves.

07
0  0
I'll go check it out.

0
10  40
Okay.

09
4,  
That took a really bad bump on the head.


  
He's out cold.


  0
Danger. Acid.

1
0  10
Cat, are you alright?


  
It's okay. I'm fine, really.


90  
Look at this mess.


40  00
It's going everywhere.

1
  0
The door's blocked. We're trapped.


90  
And that thing. The gruel.

1
01  01
It's growing.


30  30
What are we gonna do?

0
0  0
We'll have to go out the window.

1
90  90
Come on.


30  0
I'll grab his legs.


40  
Come on. We have to carry him up.

4
0  0
What's that?


  0
It's his tape player.


90  40
Look at the gruel.

7
0  0
It's shrinking.


  0
Why? What's happening?

9
40  
I don't think he likes the music.

0
  
Neither do I.

1
  40
Why would he hate the music?


  0
Because it makes you want to puke.

3
0  0
Yeah, but why does it
make you want to puke?

4
40  0
Because it's so happy.


40  40
That's it.


0  
The gruel loves bad, so it must hate good.

7
0  10
Happy is good.


0  0
Go turn up the music.

9
1  101
Let's see if I can get in his cage.

40
0  0
Daniel?

Daniel, what happened?

Nothing.

It's growing again.

We've got to do something.

What?

Sing a song, Cat.

Sing?

I don't know the words.

Well, make something up.

And make it corny.

Did I ever tell you what a
wonderful sponge you are?

Great. Keep going.

So handsome.

So terrific.

Of course. Brilliant.

Kill it with kindness.

I love your big, beautiful eyes.

All of them.

I love what you've done with your hair.

And that skin.

So damned yellow and absorbent.

When I grow up, I want to
be a killer sponge just like you.

3
  0
Uh-oh.

4
9  9
Look at the chemicals.


0  90
What's that smell?


  
It's growing again.

7
9  
What's happening?


1  1
Cat.

9
0  0
Cat!

70
0  90
Stay where you are.

71
0  0
I'll take care of it.

7
0  0
I've got this under control.

73
1  1
Uh-oh.

74
  70
Hey, it worked.

7
730  0
All right.

7
70  30
Cool a trunk.

77
00  70
As it said in the
Encyclopedia of the Weird,

7
  4
I couldn't get rid of the gruel.

79
70  70
It's mine forever.

0
4  0
So, I did the next best thing.

1
0  1
Good morning, gruelly.


0  ,
Another beautiful day.

3
  
There you go.

4
40  40
Enjoy your meal.


3  70
Oh, Killer, you're back.


4,  40
Come here, boy.

Killer.

How's it going, big guy?

Yeah.

Oh, boy, where have you been?

Oh, see?

I told you he'd come back.

Good boy.

Okay, everyone.

French toast.

Yes.

Good boy, Killer.

What'd you bring me, huh?

What'd you bring back?


  
What is it?

301
00  00
A potato?

30
  10
A potato?


1  9
There he is, Spider.
With those long legs, he


07  90
does look like a spider.
And just as creepy.


3  3
I hear he sleeps in
there. Yeah, I heard that


30  30
too. I heard he eats
rats. It's cats. I heard


  401
it was bats. Ew. Tasty.
There he goes. Come


4093  40
on, you guys. Let's
check this place out before


  
they finally tear it down.
Spider comes back.


9  00
There he is! Very
funny. You jumped. I did


01  00
not. Yeah, you did. Bird, be quiet. Scaredy
cat. I'm scared. Oh, cool. TV. Why would


01  01
somebody live like
this? What is it? It looks


01  
like a toaster. Hey,
Bird. Yeah, what? I think

1
0  
this thing's a camera. Cool. Camera. Nice.
Okay. Take my picture. Okay. Say cheese.


0990  
Cheddar. I hope you captured my incredible
juggling skills. Are you okay? I think so.


00  00
You guys, let's just get out of here, okay?
For sure. What are you doing here? I don't


04  0
see him. That was
close. That was too close.

1
04  00
I'm never doing anything
like that again. Me


01  04
neither. Greg, you
took the camera. I didn't

1
0  00
even notice I had it. We've got to put it
back. Ain't no way we're going back now. I


0  
don't get it. What?
It's a great action shot.

0
0  0
Yeah, but I took the
picture before you filmed

1
0  0,00
it. No, well, maybe you
only thought you did.


40  79
I know I did. Come
on, let's go. You could


  00
have sworn. Hey, you
guys, wait up. Hey, troll.

4
  
Don't call me that. Okay. What do you think
of Dad's new ride? It's excellent. What's


301  04
that? Oh, it's just a
camera. Something Sherry


04  0
gave me. Take my
picture. Come on. Let's see

7
0  
it. Come on, let me see it. Oh, it's a new
process. It doesn't develop right away. Mr.


  1
Troll, last call for
dinner. Hey, is that

9
04  00
picture ready yet? It
didn't turn out. Look,

30
00  00
don't you know how to knock? No, I'm taking
that class yet. I don't get it. It's good


01  0,0
chicken, Mom. It's
not chicken, Terry. It's

3
0,01  01
veal. It's good veal.
What's wrong with you?


09  03
Oh, I'm not hungry. So,
what's everybody think


00  00
of the new car? I
think you should take it

3
01  
back. Just because, I mean, think how bad
you would feel if you got a scratch on it.

3
  0
And besides, it's too
shiny. It hurts my eyes.


0  00
He's been acting really
weird ever since he

3
04  07
came home. Have you
been acting weird? No


  
weirder than usual. I
thought you'd be thrilled

40
0  0
about the car. He will be, after he takes
a spin in it. Come on, everybody. Let's go.


0  
We'll clean up later.
Shotgun. Whoa, listen

4
  
to that baby hum. I
always wanted a car with


0  03
a little muscle. Real
smooth ride, Dad. Dad,


0  
don't you think you
should slow down? We're

4
0  00
only going 3 Greg. Yeah, put the pedal to
the metal. But watch the speed limit. What

4
01  
speed limit? Just
kidding. I think there's


077  00
something I should show
you. What is it, honey?

4
0,  
That jerk. He could have killed us. That
was close. Is everyone okay? Greg? Greg?


40  
Hey, everybody. Say cheese. Cheese. I'm not
kidding, Bird. I took a picture of our new

0
  03
car. When I looked at
the photograph, it was

1
0  0
all smashed up. I'm
not buying it. I'm serious.


0  
I think this thing
predicts the future or

3
  0
something. If you're
serious, then I'll make

4
0  0
your prediction. Tomorrow,
men in white coats


0  
are going to come and
take you away. I swear.


0,  4
Well, what's it?
Picture? I flew out the car

7
0  
window. How convenient.
And how's the car?


00  0
Did it get wrecked?
No. I mean, look at this

9
04  
thing. I mean, there's
nowhere to put the

0
0  0
film or nowhere to even open it. Give it to
me. Smile. Man, cut it out. Reality check.

1
0740  09
This is a camera, not a
weapon. Oh, man, look.


09  0970
Joey Ferris and Mickey
Knox. Look. They found

3
0971  30
my camera. Oh, thanks. Come on, Joey. Look,
give it back. It's not mine. That's because

4
  4
it's mine. I don't think
so. Finders keepers,


7  
pal. I'll take my
picture, then. Come on.


  0790
Okay. I wouldn't. Seriously. I don't know.
Don't do it. What? Well, because your face

7
07  00
is going to break the camera. You want that
stupid smile to be permanent? Fish? It's


00  01
a bird. Run! Get them!
Run! You could have

9
3  0
used the gate. Yeah,
well, this way was faster.

70
00  93
Well, I'm glad you brought
the camera, because

71
9  0
now you can take my
picture. Oh, Cher, I don't

7
1  
think that's a good idea.
Come on. How's this?

73
903  40
Listen, Cher, there's
something really freaky

74
  97
about this thing. Will
you just take the picture?

7
09  90
Okay. Was that so
hard? Let me see. Greg,

you totally missed
me. No, I didn't. I aimed

it right at you. See,
there's a tree you're

leaning against. Then
what am I, invisible?

Or a vampire. Come
on, Greg. Let's try again.

Cherie. Greg. Greg. It's Dad. There's been
an accident. What do you mean, an accident?

The car, man. It's totaled. Well, I guess
I'm pretty lucky. You don't look so lucky

to me. No. I'll be up
and around in no time.

You'll take it easy.
That's what you'll do.

The car's a complete wreck.
I'm just glad you boys didn't see it.

Greg Banks? Yeah. Do
you know Cherie Walker?

Cherie? Yeah, she's
one of our best friends.

When was the last time you saw her? Earlier
today, at her house. Do you know where she

is now? At her house, I guess. No, she's
not. She's missing and disappeared. I knew

9
1  0
it. What do you mean, you knew it? I mean
that I knew something must have happened to

90
1  7
her. Oh, how'd you
know that? Well, because


  10
you guys are here.
You're telling us the truth?

9
3  
Honestly, the last time
I saw her was at her

93
40  0
house. I took a picture
of her. Oh, I'd like

to see that. It might
be helpful. Okay, well,

actually... Is that the
picture you took? Yeah,

it is, but I got... Can I see it, please?
Okay, but first you gotta know that... Just

give her the picture, please. What is this,
some kind of joke? No. This is a picture of

a tree. I guess I must be
a real bad photographer.

Listen, kid, you better
not be lying to us,

because if you are,
we'll find out. The camera

knew, Bert. It knew
that Sherry was gonna

disappear. Oh, man.
No, no, look, don't you

get it? It predicts the
future, and it makes

it bad. You gotta believe
me. Why didn't you

tell the police? Because
they'd think I was

nuts. And now Sherry's
disappeared. It's all

my fault. These stupid
pictures. This stupid

camera. This is too
weird. Look, not a scratch.

We gotta take it back.
Toss it. Throw it away.

1
0  
Man, then what if
someone finds it and takes

1
7  0
a picture with it? Maybe
it belongs to Spidey,


0  
and he kidnapped
Sherry because we took it.

1
  0
Well, that's more of a
reason to take it back.

4
70  
See, don't you see?
We have to. We did not


  
take the camera. You
did. I'm not going back


0  0
to that place. No way. You're gonna put all
this on me. Well, I got a lot of stuff to

7
1  1
do for my dad. A whole
bunch of stuff. Take


30  1
it easy, Greg. I'm
sorry. I'll see you later.

9
10  4
Are you okay? Yeah.
Well, I guess so. Where

10
4  
were you? I don't know.
You don't know? Didn't

1
901  70
Spidey kidnap you? No. It's so unreal. All
of a sudden, I was back in my backyard. I

1
7  
don't even know where
I was. My parents are

1
77  0
really upset. They
think I did it on purpose.


,  
When? I mean, when
did you come back? I don't

1
1  1
know. A few hours
ago. That's about when I

1
101  40
tore up your photograph. It's the camera.
It made you disappear. I'm gonna bring it


  10
back. Yeah, I know.
Bert told me. I couldn't

1
  40
let you do it by yourself.
Thanks. Come on.


  74
Let's get this over
with. Hey, I don't see

0
  0
Spidey. Come on. What
was that? I don't know.

1
790  4
Come on. Let's just do
this and get out. Okay.


  100
Primitive tribes fear
the camera. They believe

3
101  9
that if it takes their
picture, it will steal

4
  0
their soul. This camera
is far worse. We were


  4
just gonna bring it
back. I figured you might


  10
once you discovered
the kind of pictures it

7
  40
takes. Give it to me.
A camera that predicts


40  0
the future. It should
have made me my fortune.

9
0  4
You invented it? What?
Do you think I've always

0
0  990
been a wretched
creature slinging about at

1
9  30
night? Yes. Yes. Yes. I soon discovered it
not only predicted the future, it made it


  1
happen. And it was
always disastrous. It can't

3
104  30
be destroyed. That's
why I've kept it hidden

4
  99
all these years. Yeah,
well, it's back now.


10  
So sorry we caused
you so much trouble. That


1  3
won't be possible. You
got your camera back.

7
3  3
What else do you want?
You know too much.


90  9
I can't let you leave.
I worked too long and

9
1  10
hard to keep this
camera secret. You don't

10
  10
have to worry. Your
secret's safe with us.


1077  90
We won't tell anyone.
I can't risk that. You

1
  901
can't keep us here
forever. I'm sorry. I have


9  ,
no choice. Where'd
he go? I don't know. But


,071  9
let's get out of here.
Here it is. Those jerks

1
1  0
actually thought they
could hide it from us.

1
1  40
Here, take my picture. Here. All right.
Say cheese. Okay, let's see.


00  0
Oh, hello. I'm R.L. Stine.
I write the Goosebumps


0  ,
books. Today's story is
a night in Terror Tower.


70  1
It all begins right here,
in the torture chamber.


73  40
Eddie and Sue are about
to make their first visit.


0  
It might also be their
last. Do you know the


  
scariest part of the
tour? It's trying to get out.


0  ,00
I hope you enjoy your visit. Uh, excuse
me, miss. Could I get this gift wrapped?


40  40
Get up, you!


40  0
Oh, no! No!


  4,
Come on! Get up! Stop to the tower!


70  ,
Come on! I'm going to kill them all!

1
  0
Stop! Don't torture me!


  01
When in London, see
Terror Tower. A nice place


0  0
to visit, but you wouldn't
want to stay too long.

1
00  00
Whoa! I'd like to see the tower, where
they lock people up and torture them.

1
000  0074
Yeah, that sounds
like fun. But I'll bet you


00  00
anything we're going to go
to another boring museum.

1
03  03
All right, tourists. Back on the bus.


00  00
Hey, where's my film?
I know I had another roll.

0
00  00
The mad pig pocket strikes again.


0  00
The obnoxious little brother strikes again.


04  00
Never even felt me take it.


00  04
I have to admit, you
are getting pretty good.

4
  00
Got the fastest hands in the West.


00  
Let's go, let's go. No lagging.


  07
All right, tourists. I'm
afraid we're running

7
0  00
out of museums, but we
can go to Terror Tower.


04  
Terror Tower, yes! Too bad Mom
and Dad had that business conference.

9
000  0
Yep, we're on our own.

30
00  40
Step lightly.


00  
Ladies and gentlemen, behold. Terror Tower.

3
00  
Where hope dies, light is extinguished,
and the soul yearns for its release.


0  03
Now, follow me, everybody,
and please, stay together.


  00
They used to torture people up there.

3
00  00
They used to lock them up in the
tower and let them starve to death.

3
  0
That was hundreds of years ago, Eddie.
Now they just sell postcards.


1  00
Still looks pretty creepy.

3
00  03
Go back! Go back! Go back!


00  
Up there.

40
00  
Up there? What?


  0
I thought... Never mind.

4
0  
Come on, we better catch up.


90  00
Historians say the castle was built in
the year  and used as a walled fort.


00  0
Now, if you'll all follow me.

4
  00
Stay together, everyone.

4
00  40
Please, stay together.


  00
Later, it became a prison.

4
00  00
That started many years of
cruelty and torture within these walls.


  
Lovely postcards depicting the instruments
of torture are available in the gift shop.

0
04  
Now, if you'll kindly follow
me, we'll climb to the tower.

1
00  990
Everybody in?


00  00
Guards.

3
00  00
I'm so sorry.

4
00  
I'm afraid I have to give
you some rather bad news.

Bad news?

You will be imprisoned in the North Tower.

There, you will be tortured until you tell
us the real reason you chose to come here.

Tortured?

Did he say tortured?

Take them away.

Just a little Terror Tower joke.

We Brits have to have some fun, you know.

He really had me going.

Yeah, me too.

Now, if you'll just follow me,
we'll enter the torture chamber.

Now, please, stick together.

I'll carry this high so
that you can find me.

There are hundreds of
passages and secret chambers.

It's rather easy to get lost.

You sure you want to go
up in the torture chamber?

I thought you couldn't wait to see it.

I know.

There's something about this place.

Don't worry, I'll hold your hand.

Real food.

This way, tourists.

That's it.

Stay together.

Boy, if I was the King of England,
I'd know what I'd do first thing.

What's that, Your Majesty?

Put in elevators.

Don't dawdle, tourists. Keep moving.

That's it. Come right in.

Welcome to the torture chamber.

This is the rack.

As you can see, the prisoner
was forced to lie back here.

7
00  
Then his arms and legs were tied off so.


  00
And then when the big wheel was turned,

9
000  04,00
the ropes pulled his arms and legs,

90
00  000
stretched them out straight.


00  07
Sometimes, when the wheel was turned,

9
  0730
the prisoner was stretched.

93
0740  0
and stretched.


0740  00
until his bones were pulled.


01  1
right out of their sockets.


00  
That's what I call doing
a long stretch in prison.


0  0
Good one.


0  
Now, if you'll all follow me
over to the thumbscrews.


00  0
Hey, Eddie. Let me take your picture.


00  00
Great. Hold it just like that.

1
  0740
Hurry up.
I can't hold this stupid look much longer.


00  0
Just a sec.

3
04  000
Forget it.
I'm going to see the thumbscrews.

4
  
Ah!


00  00
Ah!


  00
Ah!

7
0  
Situ!


01  0
It moved. It tried to get me.

9
0  0
It did?

1
0  0
How can that be?

1
00  
You mustn't touch the displays.


00  
It's very bad form.

1
  
Why do parents let their
children go off on their own?

4
  000
But, but I...


001  00
The North Tower is next.


00  00
I hope you're wearing your climbing shoes.

7
0740  
I know. It moved.


90  00
I could have sworn.

9
  
What's this place?

10
099  00
It does things to your mind.

1
09  09
Thought I saw weird
things a couple of times.

1
00  00
We better catch up.

1
0  30
Come on. Let's get out of here.


40  
This place gives me the creeps.

1
40  00
Come on, Eddie.

1
01  0
They're only wax.


10  
Right.

1
740  
Only wax.


00  00
Eddie.

0
0  
Imagine being a prisoner and
being marched up these stairs.

1
00  
Yeah. This place is creepy.


  
Sorry.

3
00  
Are you all right?

4
0740  40
Come along, tennis.


  0
Yes.


4  0
We are now at the top of the tower.

7
10  70
This is the chamber where the most
important political prisoners were kept.


790  70
Perhaps you can feel
the sadness in this room.

9
40  30
It was here, in the early 1th century,

0
  10
that the young prince and
princess of York were brought.

1
1  0
Imagine two children
dragged away from their home,


1  0
locked away in the drab chill of
this cell at the top of the tower.

3
9  9
What happened to them?

4
0  40
The prince and princess
weren't here for long.


90  0
That night as they slept,


0  
the Lord High Executioner's men
crept up the stairs, their orders,

7
90  10
to kill the two children,


10  0
to keep the prince and the
princess from ever taking the throne.

9
0  0
Sue, look at this.

10
0  
Long live freedom.


  0
What?

1
90  40
What's going on?


  
That face.


0  0
Danger.

1
40  0
Did he mean to us?

1
0  0
What was that?


0  0
I don't know. This is too weird.

1
90  0
Where is everyone?


3  4
Hello?

10
0  
Hello, is anyone here?


  30
Let's get out of here, Sue.

1
  90
What if the place is closing?


0  40
I don't want to get locked in.


1  
Take it easy, Eddie.

1
70  40
Let's just go.
We'll catch up to the group downstairs.

1
0  70
It didn't go very far, right?


0  90
Of course not.

1
0  0
In a couple of minutes
we'll be laughing about this.


0  70
You scared us.

0
0  0
We lost our tour group.
Can you show us the way out?

1
30  30
You work here, right?


0  90
Wait a minute.
I thought you were a wax figure.

3
  
What are you supposed to be anyway?
A guard or something?

4
730  1
You will come with me.


7  0
Hey, that's pretty good of you, Stacey.


10  0
Hey, man, that's pretty good.

7
10  10
So is this the way out?


0  00
Hey, cut it out!

9
0  70
You know why I'm here.

10
0  0
Let go of him!


30  40
Cut it out!

1
40  40
Leave us alone!


0  
Do not move.


40  0
Do not try to escape.

1
40  70
You will come with me.

1
0  0
Now.


30  30
What's he doing?

1
30  1
The door. Get ready.


0  40
Now!

0
30  30
Hey, wait!

1
0  
I don't remember going down this far.


0  70
What does he want from us?

3
0  70
Let's not wait to find out.

4
0  0
This may be the way out.


90  
Oh, it's locked.


0  0
Try pushing.

7
70  70
Enter the King's dungeon.


10  1
Abandon all that you have.

9
10  0
Enter the King's dungeon.


0  40
Abandon all that you have.

01
1  40
Enter the King's dungeon.

0
0  0
Abandon all that you have.

03
10  10
Enter the King's dungeon.

04
10  40
Abandon all that you have.

0
0  40
Wait a minute.

0
70  70
It's not real.

07
0  70
None of it.

0
1  
It's recording.

09
40  0
It's only a display.


  0
What do you want?

1
40  0
You know.


30  90
Why are you chasing us?

3
10  0
You know why.

You will come with me.

I won't hurt you.

Why?

I'll have no choice.

No! Let me go!

This way!

Some kind of tunnel.

Maybe a lead outside.

We don't have much choice. Hurry, go!

Go, go, go!

This thing goes on forever!

Up that ladder!

Go!

Come on, come on!

It's for me!

I'm sure that's not part of the tour.

Hey, help me lift this.

Hope the bus waited for us.

What are you doing in the sewer?

We lost our tour group.

And a man chased us.

In the tower?

Yeah, he was dressed in black.

He grabbed us and he
tried to get us to go with him.

But we ran away.

There's no man in the tower.

I'm the only one here after closing.

But he chased us!

That's impossible.

I should call the police.

But we didn't do anything!

He chased us!

How are we supposed
to get back to the hotel?

Our parents will be waiting.

You remain right there.

What's he doing? Is he calling the police?

We didn't do anything!

What if he's calling the
guy who's chasing us?

Hey, there's a cab!

Hey!

Hey!

We're glad to see you.


  0
Where to?

7
1  1
The Balmoral.


  70
All right, jump in.

9
1  1
That'll be 1 pounds 0 pence.

0
1  ,0
I don't really know your money.

1
90  70
Could you get the right amount from these?


10  0
What are those?

3
,00  ,0
Coins.

4
  01
Coins? Isn't it enough?


00  
Oh, don't play games with me.


0  00
Those aren't real coins.

7
0  
We take British pounds here.


0  40
Now, are you going to pay me in British
pounds or are we going to have major trouble?

9
40  
Why would our parents give us play money?

70
10  0
Where are your parents? In the hotel?

71
  
Yes.

7
4,00  00
They're at a conference.

73
90  0
We'll get them to come down and pay you.

74
  0
No money this time, if you please.

7
0  740
And if you're not back in five minutes,

7
40  70
I'm coming in after you.

77
930  
They'll be down, I promise.

7
400  40
And you don't have to be so rude.

79
40  4
What was wrong with that money?

0
40  40
I guess Dad made a mistake.

1
00  0
Eddie, do you have the key to the room?


40  0
No. I thought you had it.

3
0  0
I guess I didn't take it.

4
00  00
I can't remember.


  
Excuse me, sir.


0  0
What can I do for you?

7
  40
Can you tell us where the
conference is being held?


  4,00
I beg your pardon, but there is no
conference right now at the hotel.

9
  
But our parents said.

90
40  0
Well, perhaps you misunderstood them.


90  0
Perhaps the conference is at another hotel.

9
  4
May we have the key to our room, then?

93
0  0
What room are you in?


  
1.

9
740  740
1.

9
40  0
That room is vacant.

97
0  0
What?

9
90  0
There is no one in that
room at the present time.

99
4  7
But we are.


0  40
That's our room.

301
90  90
What's your last name?

30
10  40
Your last name?

303
40  30
Eddie, what's our last name?

304
99  99
I don't know.

30
  0
Eddie, there's something wrong with us.

30
0  0
You don't know your last name.

307
70  770
Do you think it might be possible to check
into this hotel sometime this evening?

30
30  0
Yes, madam. Right away.

309
0  00
Thank you.

3
770  0
Now, why don't you run along.

3
0  70
And when you figure out
who you are, come back.


1  30
I'll be glad to help you then.

3
0  0
Madam.

3
0  0
What's going on?


0  
Just calm down. We can't panic.


30  30
The driver!

3
0  40
Now you can panic.


90  40
Come on. Hide in the restaurant.

3
4,0  0
As I'm sure you are aware,

30
  70
a jacket is required for
gentlemen in the Balmoral Lounge.

3
40  00
A jacket?

3
30  3
I'm sorry, my brother
doesn't have a jacket.


70  30
Most odd.

3
30  30
A jacket.

3
0  10
For the young gentleman.

3
4,  
Could you seat us somewhere in the back?


90  
I wouldn't dream of
seating you anywhere else.

3
  90
Right this way, please.


3  40
What are we going to do now?

0
740  0
I don't know.

3
0  10
Welcome to the Balmoral.


0  40
May we have a menu, please?

3
  
Our high tea includes
scones, croissants, sandwiches.

4
0  30
We'll have that, thank you.


0  0
Why can't we remember our last name, Sue?


0  0
I don't know.

7
90  
If only we could find mom and dad.


30  0
Eddie, I can't even
remember what they look like.

9
  
Neither can I.

0
  
Sue?

1
30  40
Where do we live?


00  00
Do we live in a house?

3
90  10
I can't picture it at all.

4
0  40
I can't remember.


0  0
People are staring.


  0
There must be something
wrong with our memories.

7
40  0
I can remember what I did today.


30  0
So can I.

9
90  0
I can remember our room number,

30
30  0
and that mom and dad were at a meeting.


30  00
Those memories are wrong.

3
  0
Eddie, I can't even remember
yesterday or the day before that, can you?


0  0
No.


0  0
I can't.

3
40  40
What's wrong with us?

3
0  0
Sue?


90  90
What's the matter?

3
40  10
I don't know.


70  0
I feel strange.

30
70  40
I feel like something awful
is going to happen to us.


4,00  1
I think you're right.

3
10  0
Maybe if we explain.


10  40
What, that we lost our
memories and we can't pay him?


40  4,
Maybe if we explain.

3
401  1
Maybe if we sneak in through there.

3
0  ,0
Grab those kids.


40  
Run, run, run. That's all we do anymore.

3
90  0
I know, I know. Keep running.


0  0
Wait a minute.

0

No one's following us.

1
  
What is this place?


30  40
I guess it's the hotel kitchen.

3
30  40
Get back.

4
0  1
I give up. I think we're okay.


1  40
This has got to be the
worst day I've ever had.


10  10
How do you know?

7
1  0
I can't remember any others.


30  40
You're so funny.

9
30  30
That jacket.

30
30  30
Thanks.


3  3
You're welcome.

Did you really think that
you could escape from me?


30  0
Give it back.


0  0
Give what back?

3
0  0
Don't play games with me.

3
  0
Give it to me, now.


10  0
If I give it back to
you, will you let us go?

Give what back, Eddie?

What's he talking about?

0
40  10
Will you?

1
0  30
Hand it to me.


  700
The mad pig pocket. When did you take that?

3
710  70
From the dungeon when he grabbed me.

4
790  700
Now will you let us go?


70  70
Yes.


70  7
We will go now.

Are we a traveler?

Why are you staring at me?

It's too late for the boy.

What does that mean?

I'm sorry, lass. I hope you can forgive me.

But I dare not go against the Lord.

Executioner?

Sue! Eddie!

I was hoping you'd get away.

4
0  0
Silence.


  
But we didn't do anything. We're innocent.

You okay?

Yeah. I wish I knew what they

You have done nothing

Yeah, sure.

10  10
Who are you?

You do not remember me.

Why does everyone think we remember them?


90  0
My name's not Susanna. It's Sue!


0  
My name is Morgrid.

4
30  0
I am the king's sorcerer.

4
30  30
Sorcerer?


30  30
Did you bring us back in time?

4

It's not an easy story to tell.


3  40
You are not Eddie.

0
40  300
And Sue.

1
0  3
What?


0  0
You are Edward and Susanna.

3
  
The prince and princess of York.

4

But my words are true.


40  30
I cast a spell upon you.


0  0
I tried to help you escape.

7
3  0
No! It's not true!


0  3
My name's Eddie, not Edward!

9
301  3
Just Eddie.


0  30
What is your last name?

01
30  
Edward.

0
30  00
When I sent you far into the future,

03
30  0
I gave you new memories.

04
0  0
so that you could survive.

0
0  0
in a new and distant time.

0
0  0
But the memories were not complete.

07
30  0
So that's why we couldn't
remember our parents.

0
3  
But our parents...
Your real parents,

09
70  40
your only parents,


40  90
the rightful king and queen,


40  0
are dead.

1
0  0
No. No.


3  0
Your wicked uncle has named himself king.


0  30
And he has ordered you to the tower.

1
0  3
to get you out of the way.

1
0  40
But what's he going to do to us?


0  
And Susanna of York,

by order of the king,


0  0
you have been condemned
to execution by beheading.

0
  70
So it is decreed,

1
0  70
and so it shall be done.


10  70
So do I.

3
0  0
The spell has worn off.

4
,0  30
Good Morbid,


0  40
I commend thee for thy valiant
service to Susanna and me.


  40
I promised your parents
to keep you from harm.

7
10  0
And now... Do not
despair. You did your best.


30  30
We may be gone,

9
0  0
but the idea of freedom


0  30
still lives on.


0  0
My brother,

3
0  0
let us face the executioner's axe.


30  0
with dignity.


70  90
If only there was something I could do.

3
  90
I don't understand.

3
90  3
If you sent us to the future once,


0  90
why not again?

3
30  30
Because the executioner
grabbed the three white stones,


  0
and without them my magic is weak.

40
3  3
Ah!


90  70
I wanted to come to the future with you,

4
0  30
to make sure you were safe.


  3
Alas, it was not meant to be.


0  70
Instead, the executioner
sent himself into

4
71  3
the future to catch
you and bring you back.

4
4  
I failed.


30  90
I failed, and now we all shall pay.

4
70  30
with our lives.


0  0
Bring forth the condemned.

0
40  0
My lord High Executioner,

1
40  3
spare the girl and boy.


  70
Do with me as you must,

3
  70
but first allow me to
send them into the future.

4
0  00
What harm can they possibly do you there?


7  3
And allow them to grow
up and become strong?


10  0
To find a way to return
and take their revenge?

7
  
I think not.


3  90
Bring forth the condemned.

9
0  40
Be brave, Edward.

0
4  4
Be brave.

1
0  
Please, please!


00  0
I'm afraid, please!

3
  
Please!

4
4,0  0
Go!


40  400
Orbit, despair!


0  4
Go!

7
401  0
Last hands in Orbitania.


40  0
Ovarum!

9
4,0  40
Guard! Seize him!

Ovarus!

Go, Blitzkrieg!

Arus!

73
40  0
Hey!

74
40  40
You're not supposed to leave the group!

7
9  4
I could get in trouble!

7
40  0
There you are!

77
  
We've been looking all over for you!

7
0  90
We made it! Yes!

79
790  790
Made what?

0
0  90
What are you going on about?

1
  00
Don't you know you gave me quite a fright?


0  40
If I lost two tourists,

3
  
they'd have my head!

4
40  4
I'm afraid it's my fault.


40  40
Morgren!


0  4
Mr. Morgren,

7
0  90
I'm Sue and Eddie's guardian.


40  
They're my responsibility.

9
4  0
I'll make sure they don't get lost again.

90
4  4
Well, come on, then.


4,  4
If the tower closes in five minutes,

9
  
you wouldn't want to get locked in?

93
0  4
No, no, we wouldn't want that at all.


90  90
All right, now.

9
70  
To the bus, to the bus!

9
  
Step lively, tourists!

97
  4
Step lively!

9
4  4
Those children should be disciplined.

99
0  0
Excuse me,


0  0
but we never heard the rest of the story.

01
  
Yeah, what happened to the
prince and princess in the tower?

0
0  
Nobody knows exactly.

03
  0
When the king came to the dungeon,

04
  
the prince and the princess were gone.

0
0  40
What happened to them
is a mystery to this day.

0
0  0
Come along.

07
40  40
Edward!

0
0  0
Have you been up to your tricks again?

09
40  40
Hey, don't look at me!


0  40
That's our story.


0  0
Time to go.

1
4  0
The tower is closing.


40  40
How do you get out of here?


400  40
Can somebody show me the way out?

1
0  40
How do we get out of here?

1
40  40
Really, somebody help me!


40  0
Let me out of here!

Hello, I'm R.L. Stine. I write the
Goosebumps books. You know, werewolf

legends haunted people's dreams for
hundreds of years. Imagine a full moon,

someone beneath it, slowly turning into
a ferocious wolf creature. Our parents and

our grandparents loved to be scared
by the classic werewolf tales, and I hope

you will enjoy The Werewolf
of Fever Swamp. I'll see you

after the show. Right now
I'm going for a quick bite.

What a great space. It's twice as
big as your old bedroom, Freddy.

It's kind of used. Well, it's rustic.
Rustic's in these days.

Is this a bloodstain?
No, that's just, um, dry rot.


  071
Oh, Ellie, what's wrong?
That's it. That is it. I


03  
don't care what you and
Dad say, I am not living here.

1
0  0
What is it now? The
medicine chest. Cool. Oh, it's


003  00
a little corn snake. It was
a corn snake. Oh, gross.


04  00
Hey, give the snake an ear and
it'll look like your old boyfriend.

1
0  00
Brady, don't be silly. Snakes don't have
ears. Mom! Emily, we live near a swamp now.

1
00  00
You're gonna have to get used to things
that crawl and slither. Besides yourself.


0  
Oh. Brady, set this
free in the swamp. Me?

Have fun. Mom! Go
on, a little wildlife never

hurt anybody.
Just don't go too far in, okay?

Wait a minute. It wasn't this far.
I'm not lost. I'm not lost. I am not lost.

When summer vacation
is over, I'm out of here. A

boarding school would
be better than this hole.

You know, Emily, you're
not the only one that

doesn't want to be here,
but at least I'm trying

to make the best of it.
After running into that

weirdo in the swamp
yesterday, I thought you'd be

7
0  0
on my side. Mom and
Dad have been talking about


04  00
this experiment for
years, and I'm not going to

9
04  0
be the one to ruin it.
Gee, and the one time I


09  03
was counting on you.
Everything's off the truck.


03  
Great. This place is beginning
to feel like home already.

3
  00
So, uh, when do you set the deer loose?
Oh, not for a while yet. Your mom and I


00  00
have to tag them, make sure the trip
here hasn't sent any of them into shock.


40  00
Did you ever think that
you would be spending

3
0  0
your teenage years in a
place like Fever Swamp?

3
000  0
Not in my wildest dreams.


0  01
Hey, this is a great
opportunity for you,

3
  
you know. Most kids
don't get to expand their


0  093
horizons like this. Yeah,
I bet you make lots of

40
01  
new friends. Oh, yeah,
right. Like that psycho


0  0
I ran into last night.
He's not a psycho. He's a

4
0  0
hermit. I asked about
him in town this morning.


0  03
He lost his family a
while ago, and ever


03  
since then, it's been
a little strange, but.

4
0,0  073
he just lives off the
land, doesn't harm

4
0  
anybody. I don't feel
right about this place.


00  00
It feels so... it just feels so weird.

4
00  
You see these deer
here? Up until a couple of


  
days ago, they had never
seen a swamp before.

0
04,  00
Now your mom and I get to study how they're
going to adapt, and believe me, they will,

1
01  
because it's just natural to adapt. And
pretty soon, they're going to love it here.


07  00
And so are you. Very interesting.
Glad I could be a part of your study.

3
  00
Grady, that's really annoying.

4
  
Grady. There's nothing to do here.


0990  0770
I saw you move in yesterday. You live here?
I didn't know any kids lived here.


0  09
People usually don't move
into Fever Swamp. They

7
03  
move out. Hi, I'm Will
Blake. I live over there.


0  0
Grady Tucker. So, what
are those deer you got in

9
0  0
that pen for? Well, my
parents are scientists.

0
04  04
They're studying how
the deer will adapt to

1
04  0
the swamp. Scientists,
huh? We don't get many


0  00
scientists around here.
Sounds like you don't get

3
00  00
much of anything. Yeah,
it's old timers mostly.

4
00  03
We're the only kids. Bet
you had lots of friends


001  0
where you came from.
Yeah, like 0 right on my


0  09
street. Oh, that must
have been great. It was.

7
0  00
So, uh, you want to play
catch? You got a mitt?


01  01
Um, I'm not much for
baseball. I've got some

9
07  00
targets out back. You've
got a BB gun, don't you?

70
0  
Our family kind of doesn't believe in guns.
Oh.

71
  009
You been in yet? Yesterday.
Did you get lost? Yeah.

7
01  
People say the swamp
starts to grow inside your

73
0  03
head. You get confused,
turned around. Sometimes

74
0  00
people go in and are
never heard from again.

7
0  0
You know why your
parents got that house so

7
04  
cheap? Yeah, because
it's a piece of garbage.

77
00  09
No, because the old
lady who lived there went

7
093  
into the swamp one
day and never came out.

79
0970  093
So, let's check it out. Wait a second.
It's okay. I know my way around.

0
  04
This is incredible.
Dinosaurs used to live in

1
0  04
places like this. They
still do. Alligators.


00  
You know, some of the most successful
predators live in swamps and jungles.

3
0  0
So, how come they call
a fever swamp? People

4
0  00
around here believe
there's a fever that comes


01  0
from this swamp. It makes
your body get hot like


03  00
an oven and it gets
inside your head and starts

7
01  0
boiling your brain.
Makes you do crazy things.


0  00
Even makes you run into
the swamp and stay there.

9
0  0
Maybe we shouldn't be
here. Oh, no. We got to

90
00  0
get out of here. What
is it? Shut up and run.


9  4
Come over here.

9
0  4
I only came out at
night. I saw that guy

93
4  
yesterday. You're just
lucky he didn't see you.


70  10
He did see me. That's bad, greedy.


0  0
They can't prove it, but he's the
real reason people keep disappearing.


,  7
My dad says he's harmless.
Don't believe it. He's


9  0
been roaming around this
swamp for  0 years.


0  
Come on, he can't be
that old. He's even older


  40
than that. People like
him don't age like the


  4
rest of us. It's
impossible. It's true. He'll

1
4  10
never get a day older as
long as he keeps finding


11  14
victims. The moon is
full tonight. You'll hear

3
1  110
him howling and you'll
know exactly what he is.

4
11  40
Nothing else on earth howls like that.
Like what? Like a werewolf.


70  1
Dad, why can't I drive
into town? I have a


93  40
license, you know.
You just got your license

7
  110
and you don't know
the roads. So I'll drive


1  140
slow. Is there any mail
for me today, like for my

9
1  1110
friends? Mail doesn't come until Wednesday.
Amazing it comes at all. I hear you met the

1
1111  1
neighbor boy today.
What's he like? He's okay.

111
  10
Without a car, I'll never
meet anyone my own age.

11
100  
Emily, come on. It's
not like we're on the

1
70  4,0
moon. His name's Will.
You know what he said?

1
0  7
He said there's a fever
you got from the swamp.

11
9  
The fever boils your brain
and makes you go nuts.

11
0  3
That's ridiculous. Are
you sure? Did you know

1
4  40
that a lot of people have
disappeared around here?

11
7  1
Did you know that
the lady that owned this

1
  ,0
house disappeared? But
Will knows what got her.

10
1  
A werewolf. Well that's
just great, werewolves. I

11
  0
don't know about this
Will. Will knows the swamp,

1
40  09
Mom. And you know who
he thinks that werewolf


1  110
is? The swamp hermit.
All right, I've heard just


111  
about enough. Now
listen, there is no such thing

1
11  110
as a werewolf. Those
stories are just old folk

1
111  
legends. There's never
been a shred of scientific


  1
evidence, and also
there's no such fever as the

1
101  
one you described.
And as I told you before,


1  10
that old hermit is a
harmless old eccentric,

1
9  4,
who has never hurt anyone.
Or no one's lived to tell about it.

1
0  10
No.


90  
Hello? I'm gonna kill you. Grady? Yeah,
yeah, I'm fine. That was trying to kill you?

3
0  093
Did I hear someone
screaming? No. It was Grady.

4
  100
He was being licked to
death. Where were you? You


10  
missed all the excitement.
Something upset the


  0
deer. I went outside to
check on him. He left the

7
1  104
door open. Well, I think
we found the culprit.


109  1
Hey boy. He is huge. So
that's who's been howling.

9
90  1
What are you doing
scaring people like that, huh

0
  
boy? Wonder who he
belongs to. No collar, no tags.

1
30  1
He's probably a stray.
He seems friendly enough.


  10
Can we keep him for a
while? It'll make a great

3
11  101
watchdog. I don't know,
Grady. Oh, come on, Dad.

4
1  
Life in the country is not
complete without a dog.


70  0
You want to live here,
you got to take the whole


0  40
package. We'll see.
Come on, Dad. Okay, I'll tell

7
  
you what. I'll, I'll
check in town. If nobody


  0
claims him, then we'll
talk about it. But he

9
1  
sleeps outside. Deal.
Excuse me, doesn't anyone

10
9  
care about what I think?
See? Someone cares.

11
10  0
Come on, boy. There you go.
Here we go. Come on. It's okay. Sit.

1
7  0
How long's it been since you
had someone to play with, huh boy?


10  10
Neither of us has to
worry about it anymore.


11  110
Don't get too attached
to that dog, Grady.

1
111  07
He might have a home. I
was thinking about calling

1
  10
a bamboo when a car on
the way broke in last night.


0  70
What'd you bring that out for?
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.

1
00  1
Full moon? It'll be
really spectacular. The


3  40
sun, the moon, and
the earth will be lined up

10
  09
so the earth's shadow
will pass over the moon.

11
1  
A lunar eclipse. Ooh,
can I still get tickets?

1
10  40
Someday something's going to impress
you kids. I just hope I'm around to see it.


1  40
Did you hear the howling last night? Yeah,
it was Vandal. Is that what you think?


11  110
Come here, boy.

1
10  3
Come here, boy. Don't
worry. If that swan permit

1
0  110
comes around, Vandal
will smell him a mile away.


40  7
What's this stuff tied
to the trees? Wolfsbane.


7  40
It's supposed to ward
off werewolves. Of course,


  
educated people know
it doesn't work. Oh,

0
  
right. The educated
people use silver bullets.


0  0
Shows how much you
know. The fact is werefolk


0  0
invented that silver
bullet story themselves

3
  
so poor people couldn't
afford to hunt them down.

4
3  0
Werefolk? I suppose you'd
call them werepersons.


0  40
Maybe we should go back.
I don't know this part of the swamp.


0  40
Where are we? The bog is
supposed to be the heart of the swamp.

7
  0
Right in its very center.
A couple of years ago


4  30
a kid fell in, sucked
him down like quicksand.

9
0  0
There's no telling what's down there.
I wonder how deep it is. Let's find out.

0
0  
What's it feel like? Like green slimy
mashed potatoes. Oh, this is too gross.


  4,
Hey, hey wait a second. What is it?
Something's got me. Help, help me.


0  ,
Oh, it was only a shoe.


0  
Sucker. You're not funny.
Oh man, that was awesome.


  0
You should have seen
the look on your face.


0  40
Come on, Grady. I couldn't help myself.


0  0
What's the matter, boy?


40  0
Somebody's watching us.


0  40
I thought you said that didn't work.
Do you believe everything you hear?

9
  3
Come on, let's get over here.
Oh, how cute. How funny.

90
0  7
It was horrible, mom.
I was just sitting there

9
90  40
looking up at me with
those big innocent eyes.

9
  04
So I reached out to
pet it. Well, honey, didn't

93
  90
you realize something
was wrong when it didn't


9  
run away? I thought it
liked me. What's wrong?

9
04  40
It's that stupid dog. I
know it is. We should have

9
4  79
taken it right to the pound
when we found it. Hey,

97
0  0
you leave Vandal alone.
He's not bothering anyone.

I'm not so sure about that, Grady. What are
you talking about? Come take a look. Stay.

Oh, that's sick, dad.
It was mauled by some

predator. Just like half
a dozen other animals

in the area last night.
You just killed him for no

reason. Oh, come on,
dad. Vandal didn't do this.

I mean, look at him.
Bite marks are canine.

04
7  0
So what? It could have
been anything. It could

0
  4,09
have been a wolf. Grady,
there are no wolves in the

0
4  00
swamp. How do you know?
Look, the swamp's a pretty

07
0  3097
brutal place, you know.
If that dog's been living

0
  30
there, he could have
become just as brutal. And he

09
3  3
was outside all last
night. The bite marks. I bet


4  40
they're big, right? Too
big for Vandal. No, Grady,


4  309
they're not. We think
it was Vandal. It's not


3  
Vandal. There might be
something going on out

there, but it has nothing
to do with my dog. We'll

get you another dog. No.
It's okay, boy. No one's

gonna hurt you. Make
sure of it. I don't want

another dog. He's
completely irrational. Maybe

he has that swamp fever
he's been babbling about.

It's the swamp hermit
killing all those animals.

9
0  
Gotta find his shack. I
can't let them blame Vandal.

0
7  40
They'll take him away. Oh
man, no one actually goes

looking for the swamp
hermit. Getting yourself

wasted isn't gonna help
your dog. Well, if you're

that scared, then go
home. I'll do it myself. Oh,

4
  40
I wish I never even
told you. All right, I'll

go, but I'm out of there
before the moon rises.

Won't bite. Won't bite, man. That's
all it takes. You'll meet just like him,

a werewolf. He kills
you, you're lucky. You see

anything, werewolf? I
don't know. It's dark in.

there. Get me out of
here. I didn't do anything.

What are you gonna do
with me? You can't keep me

here. Everyone will be
looking for me. Just let

me go, please. I won't
tell anyone, I promise.

I won't tell. If you let
me go, I'll never come

back here, ever. You'll
never see me again.

My parents are probably on their
way now, and they've got guns.

Really big guns.
Have you ever seen an elephant rifle?

What happened to you?
Where have you been? 

we gotta go to a motel or
something. Just anywhere,

just as long as we're away from the swamp.
Dad! All right, I've had just about enough.

You're really beginning
to scare me, Grady. You

should be scared. Dad!
Your father went to get

some supplies. Emily
took the other car into

town. Now, unless you're
planning on hitchhiking,

nobody's going anywhere. Grady,
honey, you gotta tell me what's wrong.

It's that swamp hermit,
mom. What happened? Did

he hurt you? No, not
exactly. Did he threaten you?

No. What then? He's a werewolf.

Oh, I don't have time for this.
Oh, come on, mom. You gotta listen to me.

You and dad based everything on science,
right? Things you can prove and explain.

But what if the world isn't always like
that? What if you knew something was true,

but you couldn't prove it? Something horrible,
you knew it could never be explained.

What would you do then?

It's dad.

Oh, no.

Grady, go call the
sheriff to get rid of that

dog. Mom, you can't
think Vandal did this.

Do you think a dog
can do that to a fence?

It's gonna take all night
to catch these deer.

Are you gonna help
me, or do I have to do this

myself? You saw it, didn't
you, boy? Don't worry,

I won't let it near you
again. Mom, no, you

don't know what you're
doing. I'm sorry, Grady,

it has to be done.
Mom, that dog is the only

protection we have,
and it'll warn us when the

werewolf is coming.
All right, you want to talk

about werewolves,
Grady, fine. We'll talk about

werewolves. Tomorrow
we'll talk about everything

from werewolves to flying
monkeys, but right now

we have to catch the
rest of these deer and put

this dog where it can't
get to them. Grady, it's

time to get your priorities
straight. Come here,

boy. They are straight,
mom. Grady, open that door.

You'll be safe in there, mom.
It won't be able to get you. Grady, Grady.

Bandle, where'd you go, boy? Bandle? Will?

Bandle?

Will? Will? Mr. Blake? Mrs. Blake?
Grady? Somebody? I'm in here, help!

Hello?

Hello? Mom? Dad? Will? Will?

Hello?

Where is everyone?

Got Will.
Grady, is this your idea of a joke?

Grady?

Some kind of wolf.

Ah!

Will, if you can hear me, answer!

The net! Guard him!

Not the werewolf. You!
I waited a long time for this.

Ah, you took my wife
and children, everything I

ever loved. I swore one day I would
take your heart the way you took mine.

Oh, dear. Run, boy!

Look out!

Ah!

Get away! Will! Get away,
Grady! You, you're the werewolf!

I don't want to hurt you, but
I can't help myself, Grady.

There's got to be something we can do.
No, leave now, go!

Ah!

Thanks, Vandal. Thanks, boy.

Poor Will.

Come on, you guys, you
can finish that later. Okay.

So, you two start school tomorrow. Yep.

Make some friends. I hope you have
some normal boys, non-werewolf types.

I thought you liked the werewolf type. Now
listen, you two, we've talked about this.

We know that it was some kind of
a wolf that attacked you that night,

but there is no evidence to
suggest that it was a werewolf.

Except what I saw.
And you haven't seen Will around, have you?

There has to be some rational explanation.
Anyway, it's over.

And I know one thing.
I was wrong about Vandal.

With my apologies. Honey, not at the table.

How's he doing? He seems okay.

Oh, good.
Maybe he's finally over those nightmares.

Silly tree.

I hope you enjoyed that story,
and I hope you weren't too scared.

Remember, there's no
such thing as a werewolf.

Time for me to say goodbye.
Have a scary night, everyone.
